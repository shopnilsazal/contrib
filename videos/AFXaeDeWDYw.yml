description: "by Reimar Bauer\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nScientific aircraft research flights have to be planned beforehand. For thatit is necessary to have model forecasts of relevant quantities such asmeteorological parameters, chemical composition or particle information toguide the aircraft to the location of interest. We develop the MSS Project tomake decissions easier where to investigate.\n\nScientific aircraft research flights have to be planned beforehand. For thatit is necessary to have model forecasts of relevant quantities such asmeteorological parameters, chemical composition or particle information toguide the aircraft to the location of interest. Typically, many scientificinstruments on board those aircrafts used to investigate e.g. the chemicalcomposition of the air in order to get new insights often with the involvementof different science groups.\n\nFor discussion of the possibilites of the research flights, the MissionSupport System (MSS) was developed. This software helps to review a big amountof metereological and model data by viewing the forecasted parameters ofinterest along possible regions of a proposed flight path. Data and possibleflight paths can be displayed on a hoizontal view (map projection) or on avertical view (along the proposed flight path). Flight paths can beconstructed and modified on these views. Exchange through a waypoint table isalso possible.\n\nThe talk gives a brief insight into the MSS software development currentstate.\n\nWe are using the OWS interface standard. https://geopython.github.io/OWSLib/MSS is a client/server application. The QT client interacts with a paste wsgiserver. The software is available for all platforms on conda-forge.\n\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 10:00:00"
