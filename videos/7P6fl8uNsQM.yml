description: "Jair Trejo - Non Sequitur: An exploration of Python's random module\n[EuroPython 2014]\n[24 July 2014]\n\nAn exploration of Python's random module for the curious programmer, this talk will give a little background in statistics and pseudorandom number generation, explain the properties of python's choice of pseudorandom generator and explore through visualizations the different distributions provided by the module.\n\n-----\n\n# Audience\nNon mathematical people who wants a better understanding of Python's random module.\n\n# Objectives\nThe audience will understand pseudorandom number generators, the properties of Python's Mersenne Twister and the differences and possible use cases between the distributions provided by the `random` module. \n\n# The talk\nI will start by talking about what randomness means and then about how we try to achieve it in computing through pseudorandom number generators (5 min.)\n\nI will give a brief overview of pseudorandom number generation techniques, show how their quality can be assessed and finally talk about Python's Mersenne Twister and why it is a fairly good choice. (10 min.)\n\nFinally I will talk about how from randomness we can build generators with interesting probability distributions. I'll compare through visualizations thos provided in Python's `random` module and show examples of when they can be useful in real-life. (10 min.)"
