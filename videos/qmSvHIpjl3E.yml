title: 'View Components in Rails by Harun Abbas Pathan'

description: 'There is definitely a need of lightweight view components in rails which are nothing but mini controllers and can be better fit to replace partials and filters. This talk is about Why do we need these lightweight components and details of Merb Parts, Rails Parts, Cells & Apotomo. For smaller applications Filter and Partials don''t affect that much, but as the application grows, so your code-base too; then you start seeing just too many filters and partials. So we need a mechanism to serve the unrelated sections on main view using independent mini controllers.'
