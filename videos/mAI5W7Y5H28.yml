description: "In this GDC 2016 talk, Devolver Digital's Nigel Lowrie argues that you don't really need a publisher to ship video games---until you really do, that is. Lowrie also shares specific questions that developers should ask when looking for a publisher to help out with their game. \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
