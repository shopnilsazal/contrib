If you follow its best practices and have good ‘commit hygiene’ it can also be a source of valuable data about your coding practices. In this talk I’ll describe a system we built at Civis that uses the metadata git collects, along with its logging and ‘blaming’ functionality to score commits in real time on their likelihood of introducing a bug."
