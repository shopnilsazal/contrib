description: "A Google TechTalk, July 22, 2016, presented by Francesco Mazzoli\nABSTRACT:  Suppose you have a pure, CPU intensive function that you need to run on 10000 different inputs. This seems the dream task to parallelize in Haskell, but as it turns out it is not as easy as one might think. In this talk I'll describe what we needed to do to parallelize such an application on machines with as many as 18 cores, and further what we needed to do to distributed the same application across separate machines, on hundreds of cores.\n\nhttps://wiki.haskell.org/ZuriHac2016"
