recordingDate: 1391483923
description: "Steve Dunker: Every thing you ever wanted to know about Police Procedure in 50 minutes.\nEver wonder just what rules law enforcement must follow? When do the police have to read you the Miranda Warnings? Who is subject to a Stop and Frisk? When does Double Jeopardy apply. What does a cop actually have to know before they can legally stop you? What is the effect of an Invalid arrest? Just when can the SWAT team kick your door without knocking first? When must an officer have a search warrant? \nDuring the \"Ask the Criminal Justice Professor\" part of the program I'll answer* your \"hypothetical\" questions concerning police procedure. \n* If I don't know the answer, I'll make something up that sounds good. \n\n\nSteve Dunker is a former police detective who worked as a planner and supervisor of an anti-crime and decoy unit. He was assigned to the Southwest Missouri Major Case Squad as a photographer. He is the Director of the Collegiate Officer Program and an Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at Northeastern State University."
