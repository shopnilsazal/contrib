description: "Five Sharding Data Models and Which is Right by Craig Kerstiens\n\nSharding is a heated topic and many who have tried it have come away with a bad taste in their mouth. But it's also well proven that sharding your database is the true way to scale the data layer. From Instagram to Google to Salesforce, with large-enough data and with sufficiently demanding performance requirements, you need to shard in order to scale out.
