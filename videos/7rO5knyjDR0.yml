description: "OSFeels 2016 - The Ethics and Responsibilities of Open Source in the IoT by Emily Gorcenski\n\nThe Internet of Things is upon us, whether we like it or not. From doorknobs to refrigerators to automobiles to medical devices, internet connectivity is becoming integrated not just into our consumer technology, but also our culture and everyday lives. Open source software (and hardware!) is already a part of IoT development, but to what extent do open source developers have a responsibility to the products and end users they affect? The extent of IoT adoption has the power to both empower and harm people in ways never before possible.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore the ethical landscape of IoT development. We'll talk about IoT security and robustness. We'll discuss the leftpad incident and what impact that may have on an IoT future. We'll also explore how certain industries (e.g. the medical device industry) are regulated with respect to open source and software development in general, and ultimately what responsibilities and powers developers have to forge the IoT into a force of good.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VBz8/"
