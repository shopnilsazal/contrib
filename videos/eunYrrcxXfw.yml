title: 'DEF CON 25 -  XlogicX - Assembly Language is Too High Level'
language: English
recordingDate: 1509660001
description: 'Do you have a collection of vulnerable programs that you have not yet been able to exploit? There may yet still be hope. This talk will show you how to look deeper (lower level). If you''ve ever heard experts say how x86 assembly language is just a one-to-one relationship to its machine-code, then we need to have a talk. This is that talk; gruesome detail on how an assembly instruction can have multiple valid representations in machine-code and vice versa. You can also just take my word for it, ignore the details like a bro, and use the tool that will be released for this talk: the Interactive Redundant Assembler (irasm). You can just copy the alternate machine code from the tool and use it in other tools like mona, use it to give yourself more options for self-modifying code, fork Hydan (stego) and give it more variety, or to create peace on earth.'
