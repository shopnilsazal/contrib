language: English
recordingDate: 1525927785
description: 'For Windows Server, Windows Admin Center is reimagining IT-focused graphical management experiences. This project formerly known as Honolulu, is now generally available at aka.ms/WindowsAdminCenter. Whether you’re a developer, software or systems engineer, or managed services developer, you’ll be excited by what the Windows Admin Center SDK has to offer. This platform is already being used to modernize our own Windows Server in-box admin tools, it’s fully extensible, and it leverages industry technologies like Angular. Come hear how early adopters have been building extensions for various scenarios in application monitoring and infrastructure management. We’ll cover our current SDK, types of extensions, how to publish, and share what else is in our pipeline.'
