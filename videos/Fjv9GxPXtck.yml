description: "Types and Ruby Programming Language by Soutaro Matsumoto\n\nTypes have been a big interest for Rubyists for more than ten years. Even before Ruby3, some researchers have tried to type check Ruby programs. All of them had failed. No one in the world has successfully implemented practical type checker for Ruby programs yet.\n\nWhy is it difficult? How have we tried? What do we want exactly? Can we find any solution?"
