description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #9\n18 October 2017\nSponsored by Salesforce and hosted by Campus Tel Aviv\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nWhat metrics should be used for evaluating a model on an imbalanced data set? / Shir Meir Lador, BlueVine - The subject of model performance metrics can be somehow confusing, specifically when the data set is imbalanced (as happens so often in our usual problems). In order to clarify things we will review a few simple examples of an imbalanced data sets with the different type of metrics and see which reflects more correctly the model performance — ROC curve metrics — TPR and FPR or precision or recall and which metric should we use for the different possible scenarios for an imbalanced data set.\n\nDeriving Confidence in Regression Models\n/ Shahar Harel, SparkBeyond - Predicting confidence intervals for regression is of major importance to many applications. In this talk I will describe the main approaches for this topic, present our own insights on improving bagging based quantile regressors, show comparative results on a large set of benchmark obtained on an automatic machine learning environment without any manual tuning and discuss some open issues and conjectures.\n\nSemantic Segmentation for background removal / Gidi Shperber,FastScience - Training a semantic segmentation deep learning model to remove background from images.\n\nDeploying Keras models with Gitlab CI and Heroku / Alon Burg , FastScience - Deploying Keras models with Gitlab CI and Heroku or Client side KerasJS\n\nPresenting ways for cooporation of seperate entities to create a win-win AI solution / Uri Yerushalmi, Dopamine.ai - Frequently, different entities/groups have the knowledge and data to create an AI based solution that can can be very helpful to one of the group. we will present a use case from an algo trading groups joining forces, using a scoring algo, to create a new AI solution.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
