description: "RailsConf 2018: Stating the Obvious by Ernie Miller\n\nThroughout much of this conference you're going to hear people state obvious things. Sometimes, they'll even tell you that they think what they're saying is obvious. Why are they saying them at all, then?\n\nIt's obvious there must be more to the story, so let's examine what we mean by \"obvious\". You'll leave this talk encouraged and ready to apply what you've learned to better empathize with others. Through application, you'll see growth in both your professional and personal life."
