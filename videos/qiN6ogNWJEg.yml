Until now most people have relied on add-ons to scanning tools to implement Microsoft’s complicated network APIs. Some tools wrap existing clients, such as smbclient, or use RPC calls; however, this is inefficient. What we need is a scanner that utilizes the closest thing we can get to Microsoft’s SMB libraries to scan network shares efficiently and quietly. ShareEnum uses the underlying Samba client libraries to list shares, permissions, and even recurse down file trees gathering information including what is stored in each directory.\n\nLucas is a manager responsible for leading application security assessments and penetration testing services to various clients at Crowe Horwath LLP. Lucas is responsible for developing the methodology infrastructure reviews, penetration testing services and to aid clients in developing strategies for secure technologies within corporate environments.
