Clandestine meetings in hotels. The naïve girl seduced by a suave businessman. The quiet engineer who was busted by the shredded to do list found in his trash. Encryption the NSA couldn’t crack. What motivates insiders to become threats? How were they caught? What are potential red flags to be aware of? Acquire a new awareness around what makes these people tick.\n\nTess has over twenty years in law enforcement, investigation, forensics (bullets & blood, not 1s & 0s), and industrial security. She holds a Bachelor of Sociology, a Master of Security Management, and a graduate certificate in cybersecurity technology. One of her many current objectives is to bridge the gap between traditional security and cyber security by promoting awareness and education to the technologically ignorant who are often overwhelmed by the potential threats and how they can be targeted and to the technically gifted who are often unfamiliar with the threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation techniques that lie outside their world of technology."
