description: "In this session, we will show how to simplify the deployment, management, and operations of Kubernetes using Azure Container Service (AKS). We will demonstrate how to use Brigade - a framework for scripting together multiple tasks and executing them inside of containers and Kashti - an open source reporting dashboard web interface to easily manage and visualize their Brigade events and projects through a web browser. Additionally, we will provide comparisons of the wide variety of tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem for CI/CD, observability, storage and networking.\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree"
