description: "Daniele Procida - Documentation-driven development\n[EuroPython 2016]\n[21 July 2016]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/documentation-driven-development)\n\nOne secret of Django's success is the quality of its documentation. As\nwell as being key to the quality of the code itself, it has helped\ndrive the development of Django as a community project, and even the\nprofessional development of programmers who adopt Django.\n\nI'll discuss how Django has achieved it, and how any project can\neasily win the same benefits.\n\n-----\n\nPart of my job title is _Documentation Manager_. When I explain this\nto a programmer outside the Python/Django community, the reaction can\nbe anything from bewilderment to a kind of mild horror. When I mention\nit to a Python/Django programmer, the response is usually: _Oh, cool_.\nIn fact, one secret of Django's success is the quality of its\ndocumentation, and everyone who uses Django is quick to note this.\n\nThe returns on Django's investment have been substantial, but some of\nthem are also surprising.\nThe documentation has clearly been key to the _quality of the code\nitself_, but also (less obviously) to the _development of Django as a\ncommunity project_, and even the _professional development of\nprogrammers_ who adopt Django.\n\nI'll discuss how Django has achieved it, and how any project can\neasily win the same benefits."
