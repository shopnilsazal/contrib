title: 'A Tale about The Evil Partial Mock, and the Separation by Levels of Abstraction... by Victor Rentea'
language: English
recordingDate: 1501574939
description: "Do you know what a Partial Mock is ? If you're practicing TDD, you must have faced/heard of it. And you probably have heard that it's Evil, and you should avoid it. People use it to avoid overlapping tests in a Large class, e.g. to mock a private method. But if it's Evil, what to use instead? You don't want to overlap your tests, so you really don't want your new test to run through all those little methods you've already covered with unit tests.\n\nIt's called Separation on the Level of Abstraction, and it's one of the most powerful (yet not-so-known) techniques that allow your Tests to drive your Design. TDD, remember? :) Join me for a quick discussion on a simple example (LIVE CODING), spiced with notes on SRP, DRY and other Clean Code principles. You'll love it!"
