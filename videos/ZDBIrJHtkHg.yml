Høst programs computers at NRK, the Norwegian public broadcaster. His heretic views include thinking before programming and making drawings to understand things better. This arrogant mindset no doubt stems from the idle years spent obtaining a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Oslo.\n\nPicture combinators and recursive fish\n\nInspired by last year's keynote at Lambda Days, this is an F# live coding session based on the classic \"Functional Geometry\" paper by Peter Henderson. If we think of a picture as a function from a bounding box to a rendering, we can define simple yet powerful combinators that allow us create complex pictures with ease and elegance. As a demonstration, we'll make a replica of Henderson's replica of Escher's Square Limit woodcutting - and then we'll see if we can go even further.\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2018/einar-host"
