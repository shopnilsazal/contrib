description: "Unlike commercial and consumer wireless, based on standards emphasizing cost, speed and interoperability, secure military and intel gear pays careful attention to low probability of detection and intercept (LPD/LPI) and traffic analysis. Their major tech focus is at the PHY layer using proprietary methods. Until the advent of Software Defined Radio the technology and cost to implement such protection were beyond all but the very well-funded. This presentation will review some of the publicly known capabilities of government monitoring and the practicality of defeating them using SDR, cypherpunk and varients of even amateur radio tech.\n\nSpeaker Bio: \nWireless Warrior is a long-time cypherpunk with significant writings and contributions. He has worked with notables, including: Adam Back, David Chaum, Bram Cohen, Zooko Wilcox-Oâ€™Hearn, Jon Callas and Bruce Schneier. He has 10+ years experience in aerospace (plus 3 years at a successful commercial crypto and wireless company at the director level) with emphasis on secure communication. He is a founding member of GnuRadio (with Eric Blossom and John Gilmore)."
