description: "Many apps work with large sets of data but only need to load and display a small portion of that data at any time. If you’re not careful, you can end up requesting data you don’t actually need, placing a performance burden on the device and the network. If the data is synced with your backend, it can be difficult to present fresh data to the user and still send only a small amount of information over the network. \n\nThe Paging Library, addresses this problem and makes it easier for you to load data gradually and gracefully within your app’s UI. \nIn this workshop you’ll modify an existing project, integrating the Paging Library components. \n\nYou’ll learn how each component works, how they work together and how they fit with the existing Architecture Components."
