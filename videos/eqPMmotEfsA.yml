description: "Event sourced domain naturally leads to messaging infrastructure and CQRS based services. See how we can benefit from getting rid of typical relational database model replaced by events. See how events come along with projections and different read model. In this talk we are going to explore all of this backed by a real Spring Cloud Stream applications. Don't ever lose information in your ORM-based system again.\n\nLeverage eventual consistency and event-driven architecture with the usage of pure Spring tools. Let's look into internals of databases and see that ideas like ES and CQRS are not new ones.\n\nFor the fans of Functional Programming, see how you can model your domain with just functions, pattern matching, left fold and immutability."
