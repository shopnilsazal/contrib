description: "by Kate Stewart and Thomas Gleixner\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nOpen source license compliance has become more complex as time progresses.Using open source tools and open standards (SPDX), we should be able to makeit easy to comply with the terms of the licenses specified in the code, andnot require expensive proprietary technologies. This talk will outline somesteps that will help to make license compliance more transparent, and withautomation, make it easier to fulfill the obligations.\n\nUsing an openly developed standard (SPDX), and open source tooling it is nowpossible to generate accurate summary information for a project with opensource tools, that can be shared with those that use the project. Softwaredevelopment today builds thousand of open source components that developershave shared, tools permit composition of new interfaces from code from manysources, conveying the licensing information hasn't always been a priority fordevelopers, and as a result there's a fair amount of ambiguity out there thatneeds sophisticated proprietary tooling to decipher the actual licenses ineffect. By leveraging automation to generate this information when a projectbuilds, it ensures that the intentions of the authors are accurate and caneasily be respected.\n\nThis talk will overview the problem scope and then propose some open sourcetools that can help start the automation part using open standards to improvethe transparency of the information.\n\n\nRoom: H.1301 (Cornil)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 11:25:00"
