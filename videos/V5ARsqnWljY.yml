description: "by Aurelijus Banelis\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nIntroduction to Computer Vision via WebCam game example.\n\n  * Try WebCam game during presentation  * Understand, how motion detection works with the help of `OpenCV` libraries  * Understand, the problem of low lighting and noise  * Hear real-world example of using WebCam games  * Fork and create your own WebCam game\n\n### Who should attend\n\n  * _[Mostly]_ **Software developers** , especially with the background of `C`/`C++` or willing to learn `OpenCV` – because speaker would be illustrating principles, how his game works, so later you could (fork and) create your own version.  * **Project managers and entrepreneurs** , because some business cases would also be discussed  * **Bored people** , who just want some interactive game during the presentation.\n\n### Back-story for the presentation\n\n  * Colleague from HR: _I found a video about augmented gaming climbing wall, would it be hard to implement something like it_.  * _Well... I was playing with similar technology some time ago_ – answered. Found my **6 years old project** and to my surprise – it **was still working** (actually spent about an hour to install dependencies and fix `include` values). That is what _backward-compatible_ open source software really means :)\n\n**WebCam based games still gives _WOW_ effect** (still trending, still looksnew). **But why it is not mainstream after 6 years?** To answer that question,lets dig into some implementation and bussiness use cases.\n\n### Content of the presentation/DEMO\n\n  * **Introduction** : LIVE demonstration of WebCam based game: Yes – audience could play from their seats by moving their hands :)  * **Business case** : Why not mass production? Example: advertisement for IT recruitment and meetups  * **Implementation details** : rocket science or comparing pixels (visual debugging info would be shown, while others are playing)? The problem of lighting and noise.  * **Discussion/question** : Why not mainstream: hardware problems, trend to (not) learn `C`/`C++`, difficulty of `OpenGL` lighting (if there would not be other questions)\n\n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 09:00:00"
