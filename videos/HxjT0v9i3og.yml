It’s not the beautiful design and not only the content that convinces you to use a mobile app. The app has to feel like it belongs to your phone.\n\nHow can prototyping take your user experience to the next level ? Creating a prototype is the first step, but it is more critical to get it out and receive direct feedback from the users.\n\nNo budget and not enough time? Prototypes can be fast and easy and they can help you safe time and money, because you can start developing the right things straight from the beginning.  \n\nPaper Prototypes vs. Interactive Prototypes - What’s best to use?\n\nPaper Prototypes are the fastest way to get your idea out of your head. All you need is a pen and a paper and maybe some sticky notes. You don’t have to be a designer to create communicative sketches you just need to be able to draw lines, circles and boxes. Sketching provides you an easy format to quickly share your idea with your team and sometimes even users. It is easier to give feedback when the design is not yet finished but it can also be hard for users to imagine how the flat images can ever become a real app. If it comes to the implementation of more complex hierarchies and data structure an interactive prototype can help to create an easy to use application for the end user. User flow and navigation can be evaluated more easily with a more realistic prototype with interactions. Especially to get a feeling for the behaviour of the app.\n\nMy talk should give an overview about methods for rapid prototyping based on real life examples."
