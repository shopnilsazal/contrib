description: "Leveraging Functional Programming for Data Science\nData science is full of hard problems, but the complex algorithms and mathematics rank among the least of these. Bad data abounds, and it’s easy to make a small mistake that can ruin days or even weeks of work. In this talk you’ll see how ideas and tools from functional programming save me time and effort, and how they might be helpful for you as well.\n\nTarget audience: Data scientists curious about functional programming and functional programmers curious about data science."
