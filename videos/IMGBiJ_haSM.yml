description: 'Almost every developer has dreams of grandeur made up of machines bending to our every will. This is now not only possible, but its a good a practice! Harnessing some Ruby power and by scripting Vagrant, an application to build virtualized environments, virtual machines can be used in previously unthought ways. In this talk, learn how to script Vagrant and use it to build testing environments for your Ruby libraries and applications. The end result is that your applications and libraries are now known stable on systems which were previously difficult to test.'
