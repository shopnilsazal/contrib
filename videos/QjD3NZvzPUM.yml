recordingDate: 1445988165
description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://gsec.hitb.org/materials/sg2015/\n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\nThe debate between security and privacy advocates usually comes down to three core arguments: The Security advocate argues that the risk of material or significant impact to critical infrastructure and services is high (and growing), and that these concerns trump the need to protect the privacy of the individual. The Privacy advocate defends their position with a defense of civil liberties as absolute and unalienable, concluding that security without privacy is meaningless.\n\nIn between these two extremes one finds the practitioners, trying to balance between the often reactionary compliance dictates which follow incidents associated with both. Kris Lovejoy, former CISO , now start-up entrepreneur, will explore the truth and fiction behind the debate, as well as to discuss practical, achievable steps practitioners can take to address requirements associated with both.\n\nABOUT KRISTIN LOVEJOY\n\nKris Lovejoy is currently President of Acuity Solutions, provider of the BluVector Advanced Malware Detection and Analysis Platform.
