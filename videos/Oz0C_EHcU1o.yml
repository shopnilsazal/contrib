description: "PyCon Canada 2015: https://2015.pycon.ca/en/schedule/22/\n\nTalk Description:\nMotivation: With the rise of micro services, API first sites and mobile the draw of a lightweight framework is stronger than ever.  Django and its proscriptive batteries included approach can feel too heavy.\n\n- Django is awesome, but maybe I'm missing something with Flask thing. OMG, where do I start, there my so many choices\n  - Major components of Django: ORM, routing, templating, views, forms, migrations, configuration, ReST, models, tasks, tests, static assets, authentication, sessions etc\n  - templating, forms, static assets aren’t really needed for api/mobile use cases\n  - for each remaining component offer the “best” flask library\n  - build out a small API only app together using the \"\"best\"\" flask library"
