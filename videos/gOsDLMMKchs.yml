description: 'As the private sector gains momentum and mastery of the technology capable of continuing NASA''s legacy of human space flight, we find that the general public has lost the awe and inspiration that space once held. By disrupting the standard ideology on what space means and who is engaging in this unfolding story, we can reinvigorate the human spirit of innovation and explorationâ€” and in the near future give all who desire, a chance to explore the stars for themselves.'
