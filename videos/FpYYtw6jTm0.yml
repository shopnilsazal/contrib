description: "Kubernetes on EGO -- Bringing Enterprise Resource Management and Scheduling to Kubernetes - Da Ma, IBM\n\nIBM developed EGO as a powerful resource management technology, which helps to abstract all hardware into a resource pool for a variety of analytic and high performance workloads. It is similar to open source resource managers like Apache Mesos, but IBM EGO provides more enterprise features, e.g. time based scheduling, placement policies, dynamic load-balancing, and resource sharing (preemption/reclaim). To get the benefit of those enterprise features combined with Kubernetes support for cloud-native workloads, IBM provides a connector to run Kubernetes on EGO. This talk will present the details of Kubernetes on EGO integration such as how Kubernetes can leverage EGO preemption and reclaim features. This talk will also provide some key lessons learned about running Kubernetes together with other workload-specific schedulers.\n\nAbout Da Ma\nIBM Software Architect, Mesos/Kubernetes Contributor. Jilin University masterâ€™s degree, majoring in grid computing and distributed system. After graduation, he joined Baidu, then IBM; focus on resource management, resource scheduling in distributed system."
