Now things are changing. The .NET open source community has grown in size, and with it, so have your options for frameworks and libraries. Microsoft have even annouced that they are building a cross platform CLR, so you are no longer reliant on Windows. The release of Roslyn and its rich code analysis API&#39;s is bringing with it a new wave of lightweight cross platfrom editors that can replace Visual Studio.\nIn this talk I will discuss some of these technologies, tools and libraries, and demonstrate their viability to show you that there is a new way of developing in the .NET world."
