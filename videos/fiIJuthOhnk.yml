recordingDate: 1429651856
description: 'Suppose you''d like to teach Clojure in your local community and are the first person to do--where would you start? You''d need a nice and clear curriculum with focused exercises and simple-but-engaging apps; however, soon, you''d find that writing such curriculum on your own is a difficult task. That''s why ClojureBridge curriculum team has been collaborating on its own new Clojure curriculum, so that people from all backgrounds can enjoy coding in Clojure. It is as if the team is walking, sometimes staggering, on a long and winding road leads to a better curriculum for beginners. In this presentation, you''ll learn what the curriculum team has accomplished so far, what work is on the horizon, and how you can offer your input, ideas, and help now.'
