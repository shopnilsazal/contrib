recordingDate: 1333572867
description: "We all love maps, because maps are great. That's why we're here, right? But it turns out that sometimes maps aren't the right answer when it comes to visually presenting data with a spatial component. Noah Iliinsky will discuss why, and how to figure out when to not map your data. And of course some examples will be shown where a better choice is a non-standard map, and some where the best representation doesn't involve a map at all.\n\nNoah Iliinsky\n\nComplex Diagrams\n\nNoah Iliinsky is the co-author of Designing Data Visualizations and technical editor of, and a contributor to, Beautiful Visualization, published By O'Reilly Media.\n\nHe has spent the last several years thinking about effective approaches to creating diagrams and other types of information visualizations. He also works in interface and interaction design, all from a functional and user-centered perspective. Before becoming a designer he was a programmer for several years.\n\nHe has a master's in Technical Communication from the University of Washington, and a bachelor's in Physics from Reed College."
