description: "Have you ever felt frustrated trying to investigate threading issues in production, analysing large or large number of jstack logs, trying to automate this process or just finding the tool that would extract relevant information from your threaddump? Do not worry, we all have been there!\n\nDumpling offers the combination of control and convenience you always wanted. Being a java library it can be integrated with application or its test suite and inspect the JVM from within. With its command line client that do not require installation, Dumpling can be used for investigation right away on the production. Thanks to its scripting ability and a set of preimplemented high level queries you can cherry pick relevant information from threaddump, running JVM process or JMX connection no matter how unusual condition you are looking for."
