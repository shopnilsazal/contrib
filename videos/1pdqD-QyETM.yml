description: "Sound fixed at 2:36\n\nMobile development is one of the largest growth areas in all of software. The last decade has seen an explosion of mobile devices, operating systems, development environments, libraries, toolkits and app stores. Organizations are racing to construct mobile applications that harness the power of the mobile paradigm. \n\nHowever, like in the early days of web development, security may be being overlooked or under-emphasized. In this talk, we will go through the array of mobile platforms available to developers, and discuss common security concerns that all platforms have in common. The talk will focuses on securing sensitive data on the phone, proper use of encryption, and proper use of TLS, along with several other security areas critical to writing secure mobile applications. A discussion of hybrid web apps, using frameworks like PhoneGap and the security concerns there, will also be discussed in detail. \n\nParticipants will gain an understanding of the key differences between web and mobile security, and learn what they must do to ensure they are architecting and constructing secure mobile applications. \n\nSpeakers\n\nJerry Hoff\nVP, Static Code Analysis Division, WhiteHat Security\nJerry Hoff is the VP of the Static Code Analysis Division at WhiteHat Security.
