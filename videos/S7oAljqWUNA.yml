description: "Ruby was designed to be enjoyable and to make its programmer's life easier. You know what makes life easier in the short term? Robot servants. In the long term, there are problems like the singularity and the inevitable robot uprising. But in the mean time, we can all sit back, relax, and control the lights in our home with our favorite programming language. In this talk, we'll explore how to get started using Ruby with Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. We'll bend some hardware to our whim and look at how we can use Ruby to improve our everyday life.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HKqc/"
