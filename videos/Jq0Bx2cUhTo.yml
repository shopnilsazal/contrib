description: "Get Your Shoes Back On by Jason Clark\n\nYears ago the enigmatic Rubyist _why created Shoes, a tiny GUI toolkit for writing fun, simple applications in Ruby. Shoes served as the foundation for Hackety Hack, a programming environment specially designed to be accessible to kids. \n\nIn the wake of _why's departure, many people assumed Shoes was finished as well. Such is not the case! \n\nShoes has continued to evolve and grow, and the latest revision (Shoes4) builds off the cross-platform strengths of JRuby and SWT. If you've ever wanted to write a desktop app as easily as you write a web page, Shoes is for you. If you've ever wanted to get involved in a welcoming, accessible open-source project, we'll show you how to hack on Shoes. \n\nGet your Shoes on, and let's build something awesome!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Gvnc/"
