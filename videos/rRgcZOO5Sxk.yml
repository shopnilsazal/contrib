description: "By, Evan Light\nI admit it. I like my code to read like English when possible. I am not unique in that regard. But, at least as importantly, I like my tools to be tractable; I'm unhappy if a quick trip to a gem's /lib results in confusion and frustration. If I can't understand my tools, I can't extend them. I can't truly make them *my* tools.\n\nIn this regard, it is possible to have your cake and eat it too.\n\nBecause I, and many Rubyists, are test-obsessed, this talk will focus on testing tools. We'll discuss lesser known gems (in many senses of the word) that build on Test::Unit. Yes, we will compare them to the twin juggernauts of RSpec and Cucumber. Finally, if none of the existing tools quite scratch your itch, we will discsus how you can build tools that meet your particular needs without resorting to \"Swiss Army Knife\" tools.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you will develop an appreciation for tiny tools, some sympathy for Test::Unit, reach enlightenment, add a schizophrenic/demonic voice to your mind constantly asking you \"why are you using THAT?\", save a kitten, and just maybe learn a few things to change your testing practices for the better.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GJEw/"
