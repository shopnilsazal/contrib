description: "by Hubert Kario\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe Transport Layer Protocol is becoming more and more complex. With more than4 versions deployed side-by-side, the complexity of servers is increasing evenfaster.\n\nTo fight this, we've started to work on TLS test framework that hopefullywe'll later be able to turn into a dedicated TLS protocol fuzzer. Currently wehave a battery of tests for obscure and not so obscure bugs as well as generalcompliance with RFCs defining the TLS protocol.\n\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:30:00"
