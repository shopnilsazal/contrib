recordingDate: 1399396050
description: "By Keith Pitt and Mario Visic\n\nRecently it has become common practise for development teams to deploy their code several times a day, as well as encouraging new developers to deploy on their first day at work.\n\nIn our talk Mario and I will discuss how we use continous deployment to push these practises to the extreme. Automatically deploying the master branch on new changes is an awesome way to improve your development process.\n\nAutomatically deploying master will fundamentally change how you work.\n\nKeith is a Ruby Developer from Adelaide living in Melbourne. By day he works at Pin Payments and by night he works on Buildbox.\n\nIn Keith's spare time, he watches many scary movies, and wins Magic Competitons.\n\nMario is a Ruby on Rails developer from Perth Australia, he currently works on the Microlancer team at Envato in Melbourne. As well as being a Co-Founder of Desktoppr he has also worked on some cool projects such as iMeducate and Airtasker\n\nIn his spare time he enjoys eating different types of cheeses.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1g/"
