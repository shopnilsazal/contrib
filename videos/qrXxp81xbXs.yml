description: "by Carlos Sanchez\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nBuilding and testing is a great use case for containers, both due to thedynamic and isolation aspects, but running in just one machine is not enoughand quickly needs to scale to a clustered setup. But which cluster technologyshould be used? Docker Swarm? Apache Mesos? Kubernetes? how do they compare?All of them can be used to dynamically run a cluster of containers.\n\nBuilding and testing is a great use case for containers, both due to thedynamic and isolation aspects, but running in just one machine is not enoughand quickly needs to scale to a clustered setup. But which cluster technologyshould be used? Docker Swarm? Apache Mesos? Kubernetes? how do they compare?All of them can be used to dynamically run a cluster of containers.\n\nThe Jenkins platform is an example of dynamically scaling by using severalDocker cluster and orchestration platforms, using containers to run buildagents and jobs, and also isolate job execution.\n\nThis talk will cover these main container clusters, outlining the pros andcons, the current state of the art of the technologies and Jenkins support.\n\nThe presentation will allow a better understanding of using Docker in the mainDocker cluster/orchestration platforms out there (Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos,Kubernetes), sharing my experience and helping people decide which one to use,going through Jenkins examples and current support.\n\n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 14:25:00"
