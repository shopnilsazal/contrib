recordingDate: 1520868271
description: "Filmed at http://ng-poland.pl 2017 on NOVEMBER 21 in Warsaw. \n\nSebastian Witalec\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sebawita\nhttps://github.com/sebawita\nhttps://www.nativescript.org\n\nTechnical Evangelist at Progress\n\nSebastian Witalec is a Technical Evangelist for Telerik with over 8 years of experience in software engineering and architecture. Sebastian has passion for all types of technologies. However in the last few years his focus shifted towards cross platform Mobile development where he gained experience with Apache Cordova and NativeScript (a member of the team). He is always happy to learn about the new stuff and to pass the knowledge as far as his voice (or the wire) can take him. Sebastian is based in London, UK actively working with various Dev communities in the area. When not acting techie he is a massive football fan/player (probably bigger at heart than skills).\n\nSharing Code between Web and Native Apps with Angular and NativeScript.\n\nNativeScript is a free and open source JavaScript framework for building native iOS and Android apps, add to it Angular 2 top it up with Electron and a whole new world of possibilities opens up. This beautiful combo allows us to share the code between the Web and, Mobile (both iOS and Android) apps all built on the common ground of Angular 2. Suddenly the division between the Web and Mobile developers disappears and everyone is simply a Developer like a one happy family. In this talk we will have a look what is possible from the code sharing point of perspective, how to set up your project and how to build your components to ensure maximum code sharing, but also we will look at what you shouldnâ€™t be trying to share and how to handle the differences between various platforms."
