description: "Speaker : Pierre-Yves Baloche (Gfi Informatique)\n\nCurrently, everybody wants to get AI and digital assistant into everything : so why not you ?\n\nA recent joined initiative from Google and the Raspberry community led to the arrival of the AIY Project, bringing the awesome power of Google Assistant to the tip of your maker's fingers ... but that's not all.\n\nDuring this session, we'll jam with Google's APIs & AIY Project, some Raspberry parts and of course some Python code in order to build up a pretty cool assistant.\n\nSo join \"P.A.R.K.E.R.\" and me, for a quick yet fun journey into the AIY dimension."
