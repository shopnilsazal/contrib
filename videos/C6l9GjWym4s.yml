recordingDate: 1385448956
description: "DEF CON 16 - Michael Brooks: CSRF Bouncing\nIn this talk I will be discussing Exploit Chaining in Web Applications and CSRF. I will discuss the surface area problem in security and how to gain access to a l attack surface using CSRF. I will detail the process I used to find and exploit a vulnerability in a real world application. I will discuss how to have fun in a sandbox and defeating CSRF protection. I will also talk about the defenses against these attacks. I will be releasing an 0-day exploit and provide a machine for the audience to break into.\n\nMichael Brooks is a security researcher engaged in exploit development. Michael is interested in real world attacks as well as new methods of exploitation. He enjoy finding flaws in applications and writing exploit code. https://milw0rm.com/author/677\n\nCVE's from Michael:\nCVE-2008-2019,CVE-2008-2020,CVE-2008-2043,CVE-2007-6471,CVE-2007-6459,CVE-2007-6458,CVE-2007-0134,CVE-2007-0132,\nCVE-2007-0130,CVE-2006-6781,CVE-2006-3208,CVE-2006-3207,CVE-2006-3206,CVE-2006-3205,CVE-2006-3204,CVE-2006-3203.\n\nMichael is a computer science student at Northern Arizona University.
