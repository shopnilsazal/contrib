description: "by Wendy G.A. van Dijk\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nBeginning of this century, because of perceived stagnation in development, andflamewars, and obfuscated Perl, and the rise of other programming languages,and other reasons, the attitude towards Perl became negative. We noticed andcared, so we stopped the flamewars and the obfuscated code, we organised moreand better conferences, workshops and hackathons, we made sure we are morefriendly and helpful to newbies (and oldies), and in general we become morevisible. Things changed so much, we nowadays even get compliments at opensource conferences! I will talk about our booths and devroom at FOSDEM, andour Perl-presence at other open source conferences, and our own Perl-swag.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 12:05:00"
