description: "by Charles Nutter\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nRuby's Strings aggregate a collection of bytes and an encoding, allowing forIO to avoid transcoding, regular expressions to execute against raw bytes, and7-bit strings to be compactly represented. Only the last item has been adoptedby Java. To make matters worse, most Java APIs depend on Java's stringrepresentation, making them incompatible with alternative languages like Ruby.We'll explore the advantages of Ruby's string compared to Java's and discussoptions for improving Java's string support in the future.\n\n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 14:30:00"
