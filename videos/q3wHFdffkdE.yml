description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Kirill Suslov, Shopify.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-56\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/kirill_suslov/explore-kotlin-dot-collections-api\n\nKotlin is out here for a while now but many developers don’t use full power of it and write Java-style of Kotlin. \"let\" and \"apply\" are the only language features get adopted. This talk is aimed to overcome a small learning curve in one very common thing developers work every day with: collections. Backed by familiar Java collection API but supplemented by a set of handy functions, Kotlin collection API becomes a versatile tool that helps to develop faster and makes code clearer and nicer.\nIn this talk we’ll look into most common functions and how to mix and apply them into practice.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
