recordingDate: 1430330539
description: "By, Noel Rappin\nRSpec is often described with the word “magic” by both its users and its detractors.\n\nUnderstanding how RSpec matchers, doubles, and specifications work will help you as an RSpec user. You will be able to take advantage of RSpec’s flexibility to make your tests clearer and more expressive. You’ll also get some exposure to new RSpec features, like compound matchers.\n\nWalking through a typical RSpec example, we’ll show the RSpec internals as RSpec evaluates matchers and uses doubles. You’ll leave with a better understanding of how to harness RSpec in your own tests.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/G61M/"
