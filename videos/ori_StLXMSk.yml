title: 'ArrrrCamp 2013 - Patters to deal with big ActiveRecord models'
recordingDate: 1389133679
description: "By Luismi Cavalle\n\n\"Skinny controllers, fat models\" is a well-known practice in the Rails community that everyone seems to follow. However, as your application evolves and your models grow, maintaining them can become less enjoyable than it used to be.\n\nIn the last few years, the community has been proposing patterns and techniques to deal with big AR models. Presenters, Service objects, Concerns or DCI are only a few examples of solutions suggested to alleviate the pain caused by gigantic models.\n\nIn this talk, we will critically explore these patterns in their different flavours. We'll compare them in order to expose their strengths and weaknesses and you'll learn when and how to use them to keep your Rails models as pleasurable to deal with as the first day.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4M/"
