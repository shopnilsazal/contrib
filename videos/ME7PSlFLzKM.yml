description: "by: Joseph Wilk\n\nRuby has a thriving testing ecosystem which is leading the way in many ways. But innovation in testing is not limited by language. Lots of interesting ideas are evolving from outside our comfy red world. Itâ€™s time we expanded our horizons and learn about some of the testing ideas evolving around other languages. Come to be inspired by new ideas, see how language changes the way we think about testing and discover what life is like in other testing lands."
