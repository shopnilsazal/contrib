description: "“API?” – How LendingHome Approaches “Legacy” Technologies by Sam Aarons\n\nLendingHome is on a mission to simplify the mortgage process, but that’s not always easy in a world where we hear “API? What’s that?” from our third-party vendors. For the ones that do have technology solutions the phrases “FTP” and “Fixed-Width” are frequently thrown around.\n\nThis talk will dive into the solutions we’ve built that abstract away some of these concepts and how we provide clean interfaces for these services to the rest of the organization. If you’ve ever wanted to learn how modern companies interface with the old, this is the talk for you.\n\nThis is a sponsored talk by LendingHome."
