title: 'Why giving your algorithm ALL THE FEATURES does not always work - Thomas Huijskens'
recordingDate: 1527479665
description: "PyData London 2018\n\nWe'd like to think of ML algorithms as smart, and sophisticated, learning machines. But they can be fooled by the different types of noise present in your data. Training an algorithm on a large set of variables, hoping that your model will separate signal from noise, is not always the right approach. We'll discuss different ways to do feature selection, and discuss open-source implementations.\n\nSlides:  https://lnkd.in/gyJw8gp\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
