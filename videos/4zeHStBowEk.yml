What does it\ndo, both good and bad?\n\nCome learn all about the Python GIL.  You'll learn about its history,\nall the problems it solves, all the problems it causes (that we know\nabout!), and what it would take to remove the GIL.\n\nAttendees should be familiar with the terrors inherent in\nmultithreaded programming, and be comfortable with a little C code in\nthe slides."
