description: "Uber Engineering discusses how we used plugins (otherwise known as pickup refinement steps) on top of RIBs during the redesign of our mobile architecture to facilitate greater code isolation. In this presentation, we discuss why we needed to ensure that ‘children’ and ‘parent’ code were segmented and could be executed independently of each other to scale our apps rationally. \n\nFor more info see: https://eng.uber.com \n\n===================================================\nMore on the Uber Engineering Mobility Meetups Series\nhttps://www.uber.com/p/uber-mobility/\n\nWelcome to Uber Mobility, a meetup series focused on building scalable, high-quality mobile applications. The platform-agnostic topics today will help you build better mobile applications at scale for a global market.\n\nChoosing the right architecture for your mobile architecture has a long-lasting effect on the productivity of your team and the reliable extensibility of your application. Bad architectural decisions might not immediately be obvious, but will affect the entire team for years to come.\n\nDuring our Fourth Uber Mobility Meetup, we’ll run you through why we decided to create a new architecture and how we managed to rewrite and launch Uber’s rider app with this new architecture in record time. We’ll talk through the core principles of the new architecture and why we think it’s a perfect fit for creating reliable, highly maintainable mobile applications, especially when you’re working at scale and have a large mobile team.\n\nMore on Uber Engineering Events:https://www.meetup.com/pro/Uber/"
