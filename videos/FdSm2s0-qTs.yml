description: "It has been three years since Octodad first wrapped his tentacles around the Internet, attempting to give it a fatherly hug. Of the 20 students who created the original Octodad, eight went on to form Young Horses and create Octodad: Dadliest Catch. But with a team as new to being adult humans as Octodad himself, development began...clumsily. In this GDC 2014 talk from John Murphy, hear how learning to empathize and communicate while making Dadliest Catch has shaped the team, Octodad and the future of Young Horses.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
