description: "Yashar Mehdad leads the machine learning and natural language processing efforts to improve customer support at Airbnb. Before that he lead Yahoo’s publisher products (Yahoo homepage, Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Sports) science team working on content understanding, personalization and ranking. Yashar published over 40 refereed articles and filed more than 10 patents in machine learning and natural language processing. He received his PhD from University of Trento and completed his postdoctoral research in University of British Columbia. Yashar also served as a chair, co-organizer, programme committee and reviewer in various top tier academic workshops, conferences and journals and received few academic and industrial awards.\n\n\nAirbnb: Driving a Higher Level of Customer Support with Machine Learning:\n“The initial Airbnb customer service operation was humble: one guy and his cell phone”. Now, Airbnb has thousands of agents available via phone, chat and email, 24/7, in every time zone and in 30 different languages. Such level of above-and-beyond customer support is not scalable nor sustainable without the power of data and insights we glean from it with the help of machines. At Airbnb, Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) hold the promise to facilitate, optimize and improve customer experiences. Such applications range from understanding customer feedbacks and issues to providing a more reachable and efficient service in order to resolve the issues more effectively. In this talk, I will highlight various ways in which ML and NLP techniques are used in supporting our customers. I will then dig deeper into one or two use cases in more details, explaining the challenges, our approaches, lessons learned and our future directions. Come hear about how the Airbnb customer support team embeds machine learning to provide a higher level of support, customized care, and love."
