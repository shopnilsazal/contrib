Also similar to real debt, tech debt will *snowball* if you keep adding on more and not paying it off.\n\nðŸ”—  mpj on Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/mpjme\n\nðŸ”—  The camera I use\nhttp://amzn.to/2kwlpAD\n\nðŸ”—  The microphone and sound recorder I use\nhttp://amzn.to/2kwli8e\nhttp://amzn.to/2lcVSfd\n\nðŸ”—  The lights I use\nhttp://amzn.to/2ld8jrX"
