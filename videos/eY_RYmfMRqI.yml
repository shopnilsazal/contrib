description: "Description from DEF CON 9 Speakerâ€™s Page: \nNAT For Newbies and Not-So-Newbies: A Tutorial\n\nNetwork Address Translation (NAT) is a cheap and simple method for boosting the effectiveness of your firewall.\_ Properly configured NAT can help hide your internal network structure from outsiders, enforce 'outbound only' connections from internal hosts, and preserve scarce IPv4 addresses.\_ This tutorial moves quickly through the basics, discusses a typical NAT configuration, describes NAT in action, enumerates the benefits of NAT, explains several potential pitfalls and shows how to configure DNS to accommodate the translated addresses.\n\nBarry J. Stiefel (\"Stee-ful\"), B.Sc., MBA, CISSP, MCSE, CCNA, CCSA/E/I, A+, is the Chief Technical Consultant at Information Engine, Inc., a Silicon Valley networking and security consulting firm.\_ Previously, he was the founding Manager of Information Systems at Galileo Technology and was President of the Windows NT Engineering Association."
