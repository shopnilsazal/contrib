description: "Crystal: The Programming Language by Luis Ferreira\n\nCrystal is a typed, LLVM compiled language that reads (mostly) as Ruby.\n\nIf you’ve ever faced a problem in which you would like to use Ruby (because it is awesome), but it is just not performant enough, maybe Crystal is the solution you’ve been looking for.\n\nCrystal’s standard lib comes bundled with support for WebSockets, OAuth, MySQL, and other nice utilities. It has a very simple testing framework, dependency management system, and even the beginnings of a web framework.\n\nThis is a very exciting time to come aboard the Crystal train, especially coming from a Ruby background."
