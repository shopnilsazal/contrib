description: "DEF CON 16 - Lyn:Tuning Your Brain.\nI can't tell you how often I'm listening to trance, goa or industrial when I'm coding. Often when we're stuck in a black hole, or just can't figure the problem out - the right music will help. Why does this work? It seems motivating, and it seems like we solve problems easier, and it seems to create a flow. Turns out, your brain is like a tuning fork. This talk will include a bit of biology - going over the basics of the brain structures, neurons, synapses and neurotransmitters, before getting to how music affects the brain, and how it helps us think.\n\nLyn is a web developer with a lot of time on her hands apparently. Her last EE experience was in the 5th grade, soldering boards for a $5 allowance. Oh, and she once was a research assistant and spent a lot of time attaching electrodes and preparing study participants for an EEG. Neurology has been her hobby since then. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
