description: "AppSec California 2015 - Day 1, Track 1, Slot 7\n\nTitle\n\nFix The Damned Software\n\nAbstract\n\nWe've learned much about application security during its lifetime. We've honed assessment techniques and improved vulnerability discovery tools. This mastery hasn’t resulted in secure software, it’s piled up bugs. The recent push to place better testing tools in the hands of developers will do little more. \n\nIt’s time we _Fix_the_damned_software_. It’s time we _build security_in_. It’s time to _design_securely_.\n\nUsing experience and BSIMM survey data we look at what this challenge means and how we can meet it today, with today’s dev frameworks and tools, dev cultures, and security memes. \n\nBio\n\nJohn’s expertise runs the gamut of software security from threat modeling and architectural risk analysis, through static analysis (with an emphasis on automation), to security testing. As a consultant, John has provided strategic direction to many multi-national corporations, and his keen interest in automation keeps Cigital technology at the cutting edge. He has served as co-editor of the Building Security In department of IEEE Security & Privacy magazine, speaks with regularly at conferences and trade shows, and is the leader of the Northern Virginia OWASP chapter.
