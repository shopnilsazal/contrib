description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nDeclarative Multi-Cluster Monitoring with Prometheus - Matthias Loibl, Loodse & Frederic Branczyk, CoreOS (Beginner Skill Level)\n\nLoodse and CoreOS run many different setups across multiple heterogeneous public and private clouds. In this context, they faced some challenges with deploying the monitoring infrastructure. Matthias and Frederic will show you how declarative monitoring helps their teams to work consistently in many different environments. They will show you how to apply these techniques to Prometheus, the Alertmanager and Grafana. Finally, they will give an outlook on what the community is going to improve in the distant future.\n\nAbout Frederic\nFrederic is an engineer at CoreOS contributing to Prometheus and Kubernetes to build state of the art modern infrastructure and monitoring tools. He discovered his interest in monitoring tools and distributed systems in his previous jobs, where he used machine learning to detect anomalies indicating intrusion attempts. He also worked on projects involving secrets management for distributed applications to build sane and stable infrastructure.\n\nAbout Matthias\nMatthias is a Software Engineer at Loodse. He loves working on Distributed Systems with Go, Docker, Kubernetes and Prometheus. In his free time, he contributes to numerous open source projects related to Prometheus and Drone."
