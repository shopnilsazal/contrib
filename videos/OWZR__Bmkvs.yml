description: "By, Ilya Grigorik\nThe world of concurrent computation is a complicated one. We have to think about the hardware, the runtime, and even choose between half a dozen different models and primitives: fork/wait, threads, shared memory, message passing, semaphores, and transactions just to name a few. And that's only the beginning.\n\nWhat's the state of the art for dealing with concurrency & parallelism in Ruby? We'll take a quick look at the available runtimes, what they offer, and their limitations. Then, we'll dive into the concurrency models and ask are threads really the best we can do to design, model, and test our software? What are the alternatives, and is Ruby the right language to tackle these problems?\n\nSpoiler: out with the threads. Seriously.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GJEt/"
