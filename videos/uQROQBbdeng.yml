recordingDate: 1418082908
description: "By, Jeremy Flores, Carol Nichols and Brenna Flood \nMany incredible people have given many amazing talks at Ruby or Rails conferences over the years, and we’d like to take a look back at some of the best. From _why the Lucky Stiff to Sandi Metz, from Matz to DHH, from Tenderlove to Jim Weirich, we will be giving you a whirlwind tour through the conference ages. You’ll learn where those important ideas you take for granted got their start. You’ll laugh and you’ll cry as you experience how the Ruby Community has grown over the years and how we’ve connected through our shared conference experiences. Rain ponchos recommended for the front row. This talk features creations by Brenna Flood.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Fl5N/"
