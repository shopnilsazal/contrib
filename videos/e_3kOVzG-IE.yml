title: 'GeeCON Prague 2017: Niek Palm - GraphQL - The Next API Language'
recordingDate: 1516816640
description: 'Today we build most of our APIâ€™s in a RESTful way by delivering json data. This approach creates a tight and inflexible coupling between front- and back-end, and requires many client server interactions. This way of using an API on mobile devices, which are typically connected via unreliable, slow, and high latency networks, causes developers a lot of headaches. However, there is a new API kid on the block: GraphQL that solves this issues. GraphQL is a new way of specifying an API based on the demand of the API consumer. I will show you the the power of GraphQL and what you can do with GraphQL that could not be done with REST.'
