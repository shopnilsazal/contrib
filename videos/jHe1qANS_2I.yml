description: "Lightning Talk: BGP Routing in Kubernetes - Pankaj Sehgal, Tata Consultancy Services\n\nKubernetes imposes some requirements on networking of pods/containers. You cannot take two machines running containers and expect Kubernetes to work. There are number of ways we may make it work, but there is much simpler custom BGP Protocol develop to achieve this.\n\nAbout Pankaj Sehgal\nI have been working with Apple as a consultant for past 5 years. Major focus is always on round the clock availability of icloud services. I love working with new micro technologies and running in my free time."
