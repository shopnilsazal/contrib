description: "Copy of the slides for this talk are here: https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Douba/DEFCON-20-Douba-Sploitego.pdf\nExtras: https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Douba/Extras.zip \n\nSploitego - Maltego's (Local) Partner in Crime\nNadeem Douba Cygnos IT Security\n\nHave you ever wished for the power of Maltego when performing internal assessments? Ever hoped to map the internal network within seconds? Or that Maltego had a tad more aggression? Sploitego is the answer. In the presentation we'll show how we've carefully crafted several local transforms that gives Maltego the ooomph to operate nicely within internal networks. Can you say Metasploit integration? ARP spoofing? Passive fingerprinting? SNMP hunting? This all is Sploitego. But wait - there's more. Along the way we'll show you how to use our awesome Python framework that makes writing local transforms as easy as 'Hello World'.\n\nSploitego makes it easy to quickly develop, install, distribute, and maintain Maltego Local transforms. The framework comes with a rich set of auxiliary libraries to aid transform developers with integrating attack, reconnaissance, and post exploitation tools. It also provides a slew of web tools for interacting with public repositories.\n\nSploitego and its underlying Python framework will be released at DEF CON as open source - yup - you can extend it to your heart's content. During the presentation we'll show the awesome power of the tool with live demos and scenarios as well as fun and laughter.\n\nNadeem Douba - GWAPT, GPEN: Currently situated in the Ottawa (Ontario, Canada) valley, Nadeem is a senior research analyst at Cygnos Information Security (a Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton company).
