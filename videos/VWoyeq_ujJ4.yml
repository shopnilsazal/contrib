The good background for this talk is people with minimal knowledge about threads. After this talk I expect that the audience can be enable to understand multiprocessing, when use and which tools and methods are appropriate for each case. \n\nUnderstanding threads\nIt's the first moment on the talk. Here I'll speak about the thread theory and what happen when we use threads on the OS\nThreads and multiprocess API\nI'll give simple examples about what python give us to use threads and multiprocessing perhaps with two APIs \nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.5/library/multiprocessing.html\nUnderstanding Green threads\nHere I'll speak about green threads theory and what happen when we use green threads on our OS\nGreen thread Patterns and tools\nHere I'll show few examples with keep alive patterns, discuss about a few tools and show gevent and asyncio examples\nParallelism x asynchronism\nI'll show the diference between parallelism and asynchronism discussing about the two theories\nWhy, when and how\nIt's is the last talk moment and I'll explain the how complex is work with multiprocess showing cases like queues consume and APIs consume\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
