description: "Kubernetes Distributions and 'Kernels' - Tim Hockin & Michael Rubin, Google\n\nKubernetes has historically released a full fledged distribution - everything you need. As the project gets more modular, that will become more complicated. This talk will explore the problems we face with this, and some ways can solve them, considering other analogous OSS ecosystems.\n\nAbout Tim Hockin\nTim is a Principal Software Engineer at Google, where he works on the Kubernetes and Google Container Engine (GKE).  He is a co-founder of the project, and he is responsible for topics like networking, storage, node, federation, resource isolation, and cluster sharing. Before Kubernetes, he worked on Google's Borg and Omega projects and the Linux Kernel, and before that he enjoyed playing at the boundary between hardware and software in Google's production fleet.\n\nAbout Michael Rubin\nTwenty years in the Systems Software Industry, from developing enterprise file servers and systems. The past ten years he has worked at Google where he founded the Linux Storage group for its data centers and worked on world wide WAN and BGP technologies. Today he is co-leading and managing Kubernetes Infrastructure with a focus on node, networking, storage, sharing, GPUs and multi-cluster efforts. For some reason he is still spending way too much personal time with file servers."
