description: "AppSec California 2015 - Day 2, Track 3, Slot 2\n\nTitle\n\nHackazon – Stop hacking like its 1999\n\nAbstract\n\n“Applications have changed, but your test apps havent!\nIts about time for a test app that’s a little more current than circa 2002. Enter Hackazon.\n\nHackazon, is a modern vulnerable web application. It looks like an online storefront with a modern AJAX interface, strict workflows and RESTful API’s used by a companion mobile app. And, its here to replace the old Web 1.0 test apps (WebGoat, DVWA, Hackme Bank and Hackme Casino) that no longer mirror the applications we see in the wild. Will your application security scanner successfully test this site? Doubt it! Even manual pen testers will have their hands full testing their skills against it.\n\nThere are vulnerabilities scattered throughout Hackazon, and each vulnerable area is configurable so that users can change the vulnerability landscape to prevent “known vuln testing” or any other form of cheating. To find all the vulnerabilities in Hackazon it will require proper handling of not only classic web security, but will require testing RESTful interface formats that power AJAX functionality and mobile clients (JSON, XML, GwT, and AMF). It will also require tedious testing of strict workflows common in todays business applications.\n\nHackazon is an open source application that will ultimately be contributed to OWASP to be included with the other vulnerable test applications.\n\nJoin Dan for this talk where he will demonstrate Hackazon and the techniques required to find the vulnerabilities in the different interfaces and formats.”\n\nBio\n\n“Dan Kuykendall\nco-CEO and CTO, NT OBJECTives\n\nDan has been with NTO for more than 10 years and is responsible for the strategic direction and development of products and services. He also works closely with technology partners to make sure our integrations are both deep and valuable. As a result of Dan’s dedication to security, technology innovation and software development, NTO application security scanning software is often recognized as the most accurate because of its sophisticated automation techniques.\n\nDan joined NTO from Foundstone, where he was a key developer of FoundScane’s scan management, and remediation capabilities. Before Foundstone, Dan was the founder of the Information Security team in the United States branches of Fortis.\n\nWhen Dan’s not working on NTO products or screen sharing with our customers to help them solve their application security challenges, you’ll find him blogging, co-hosting An Information Security Place Podcast and speaking at conferences like B-Sides, OWASP AppSecUSA, HouSecCon, ToorCon and more. He also works with industry groups and contributes to many open source development projects. Little known fact about Dan, he was a founder of the phpGroupWare project and creator of podPress.”\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
