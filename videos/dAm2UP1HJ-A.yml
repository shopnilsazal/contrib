recordingDate: 1523113483
description: 'At this point every respectable iOS app and developer uses auto layout but what is it? How did we get there? What have changed for us in a day to day work? What is the current state of the art? Which concepts are obsolete? Definitely a lot has changed – evolved. Let’s try to understand it. This talk is the Julian’s attempt to systemise what we know about auto layout and how we should use it. Putting it in the historic context is a way to better understand concepts and principles as well as possible approaches. Additionally, Julian shares his experience on solving common, and less common, pitfalls with some pro tips.'
