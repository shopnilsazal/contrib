In a lot of situations\nthat does not matter.  Sometimes it really does.  This talk will\nintroduce you to some tools and techniques for making sure your Python\ncode becomes fast enough – without turning into a maintenance\nnightmare.  Fast code does not have to be unreadable - and when you're\nwriting Python, it really pays of to think \"pythonically\".\n\nThat does mean using the included batteries, and utilising the\necosystem of tools around the language, too.\n\n Warning: may contain small bits of other languages."
