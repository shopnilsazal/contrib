language: English
recordingDate: 1456765925
description: "\"Valve has been creating advanced prototype VR HMD's since mid-2013 that are more advanced than other developers currently have access to, and this head start has granted them a VR-specific rendering knowledge that they'd like to share with developers who are actively working on VR or plan to in the near future. Alex Vlachos begins with the base requirements of VR rendering, and progresses into advanced rendering topics focusing on both performance and visual quality. \n\"\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
