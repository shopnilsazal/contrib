description: "by Thomas Fischer\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nWith the recent announcement of the SAP HANA, express edition, a free to useand streamlined version of SAP HANA that can run on laptops and otherresource-constrained hosts, it is now possible to use the SAP HANA Graphfunctionality for free in own graph projects and applications with up to 32GBmain memory limit. In addition, the SAP HANA, express edition offersdevelopment utilities that can be used to develop own applications on top ofSAP HANA.\n\nIn this presentation, we will provide an overview of SAP HANA Graph, a nativegraph processing engine, which is tightly integrated into the database kernelof SAP HANA. It allows to freely combine graph, relational, text, andgeospatial processing on a single transactional data representation withoutthe need to replicate data into specialized systems. In particular, we willuse the SAP HANA, express edition running on the speaker's laptop todemonstrate the audience a walk-through of the steps to get started with SAPHANA Graph. Specifically, we will show how to execute openCypher queries inSAP HANA and also showcase GraphScript, a high-level domain-specific graphquery language for imperative and complex graph query processing.\n\n\nRoom: H.2214\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 14:50:00"
