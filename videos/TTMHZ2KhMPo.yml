description: "Adam Bresson - DEF CON 10 Talk: Consumer Media Protections\nDid you buy The Fast and the Furious Soundtrack only to find out you couldn' t archive the songs to MP3s on your PC? Companies including Vivendi Universal, AOL Time Warner and Sony employ different protection methods on DVDs, video games and CDs. Many consumers argue that these protections abrogate their legal rights. I'll be presenting a broad overview of these Consumer Media Protections (CMPs) and will conduct demonstrations of how to identify and bypass them. I will focus on bit-level video game, video signal and audio CMPs. Whichever side of the legal argument you fall on learn the law, learn your rights and speak-up.\n\nAdam Bresson owns GreentreePC a Los Angeles-based on-site network consulting service. At DEF CON 8 and 9, he spoke on Palm and PHP security, respectively. He founded and continues to develop two exciting Internet startups: Recommendo.com and GetAnyGame.com"
