description: "Images, videos and other digital media provide a convenient and expressive way to communicate through social networks. But such broadcastable and information-rich content provides ample illicit opportunity as well. Web-prevalent image files like JPEGs can be disguised with foreign data since they're perceivably robust to minor pixel and metadata alterations. Slipping a covert message into one of the billions of daily posted images may be possible, but to what extent can steganography be systematically automated and scaled?\n\nTo explore this, we first report the distorting side effects rendered upon images uploaded to popular social network servers, e.g. compression, resizing, format conversion, and metadata stripping. Then, we build a convolutional neural network that learns to reverse engineer these transformations by optimizing hidden data throughput capacity. From pre-uploaded and downloaded image files, the network learns to locate candidate metadata and pixels that are least modifiable during transit, allowing stored hidden payloads to be reliably recalled from newly presented images. Deep learning typically requires tons of training data to avoid over fitting. But data acquisition is trivial using social networks' free image hosting services, which feature bulk uploads and downloads of thousands of images at a time per album. \n\nWe show that hidden data can be predictably transmitted through social network images with high fidelity. Our results demonstrate that AI can hide data in plain sight, at large-scale, beyond human visual discernment, and despite third-party manipulation. Steganalysis and other defensive forensic countermeasures are notoriously difficult, and our exfiltration techniques highlight the growing threat posed by automated, AI-powered red teaming."
