description: "Composer C. Andrew Rohrmann, aka scntfc presents a modular approach to music writing, production and implementation via an overview of the creation of the music for Galak-Z. He demonstrates how (with the aid of 17-Bit Games' Unity-based Audio17 music environment) composers can create multi-layered and hyper-adaptive musical elements that react to multiple gameplay variables, and combine to form an arrangement that is unique for each and every play session.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
