description: "What happens when a company either doesn’t fully empower the Security team, or have one at all? Stuff like Goto fail, Equifax, unsandboxed AVs and infinite other buzz, or yet to be buzzed, words describe failures of not adequately protecting customers or services they rely on. Having a solid security team enables a company to set a bar, ensure security exists within the design, insert tooling at various stages of the process and continuously iterate on such results. Working with the folks building the products to give them solutions instead of just problems allows one to scale, earn trust and most importantly be effective and actually ship.\n\nThere’s a whole security industry out there with folks wearing every which hat you can think of. They have influence and the ability to find a bug one day and disclose it the next, so companies must adapt both engineering practices and perspectives in order to ‘navigate the waters of reality’ and not just hope one doesn’t take a look at their product. Having processes in place that reduce attack surface, automate testing and set a minimum bar can reduce bugs therefore randomization for devs therefore cost of patching and create a culture where security makes more sense as it demonstratively solves problems.\n\nNvidia is evolving in this space. Focused on the role of product security, I’ll go through the various components of a security team and how they each interact and complement each other, commodity and niche tooling as well as how relationships across organizations can give one an edge in this area. This talk balances the perspective of security engineers working within a large company with the independent nature of how things work in the industry.\n\nAttendees will walk away with a breadth of knowledge, an inside view of the technical workings, tooling and intricacies of finding and fixing bugs and finding balance within a product-first world.\n\n=== \n\nJeremy is an security professional largely focused on application security along with vulnerability research and development. He has led critical projects at large software and service companies for several years as well as publishing research in the security community. Working in many different areas including exploit mitigations, scalable fuzzing, low-level mobile and web security has sharpened his ability to dive deep and understand which areas are important. He has the proven execution for scaling security across organizations, providing comprehensive coverage for critical services, reduction of attack surfaces and automating security at all stages in the development lifecycle. Continuing interests include static analysis, OS internals and all things fascinating in the field of computer security."
