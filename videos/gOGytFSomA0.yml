description: '802.11ac networks present a significant challenge for scalable packet sniffing and analysis. With projected speeds in the Gigabit range, USB Wi-Fi card based solutions are now obsolete! In this workshop, we will look at how to build a custom monitoring solution for 802.11ac using off the shelf access points and open source software. Our "Hacker Gadget" will address 802.11ac monitoring challenges such as channel bonding, DFS channels, spatial streams and high throughput data rates. We will also look different techniques to do live streaming analysis of 802.11 packets and derive security insights from it!'
