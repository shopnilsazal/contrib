title: 'DEF CON 16 - Panel: Living in the RIA World'
recordingDate: 1385426707
description: "DEF CON 16 - Panel: Living in the RIA World\nRich Internet Applications (RIA) represent the next generation of the Web. Designed to run without constant Internet connectivity, they provide a graphical experience equivalent to thick desktop applications with the easy install experience of thin Web apps. They intentionally blur the line between websites and traditional desktop applications and greatly complicate the jobs of web developers, corporate security teams, and external security professionals.\n\nOur goal with this talk will be to outline the different attack scenarios that exist in the RIA world and to provide a comparison between the security models of the leading RIA platforms. We will discuss how current attacks against web applications are changed with RIA as well as outline new types of vulnerabilities that are unique to this paradigm. Attendees will learn how to analyze the threat posed to them by RIA applications as either providers or consumers of software built on these new platforms.\n\nWe will also be discussing the attack surface exposed by the large media codec stacks contained in each of these platforms. Our targeted platforms include Adobe AIR, Microsoft Silverlight, Google Gears, JavaFX, and Mozilla Prism. At this talk, we will be releasing tools for testing the codec security of these platforms as well as sample malicious code demonstrating the danger of RIA applications.\n\nAlex Stamos is a Founding Partner of iSEC Partners and is an experienced security engineer and consultant specializing in application security and incident response.
