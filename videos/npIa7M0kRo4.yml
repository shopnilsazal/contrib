description: "PyData Dallas 2015\nPoliticians make claims of \"facts\" all the time. Oftentimes there are false and misleading claims on important topics, due to careless mistakes and even deliberate manipulation of information. Journalists and reporters spend good amount of time to check veracity of factual claims important to the public. We have been working on a computational journalism project for several years. Part of the project's goal is to help journalists check such claims. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the project and introduce specifically how we use Python in fact-checking claims made in presidential debates."
