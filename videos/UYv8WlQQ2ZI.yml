title: 'Fixing the Unfixable: Solving Pervasive Vulnerabilities with RASP - Jeff Williams - AppSec Ca 2016'
recordingDate: 1458612207
description: "Some vulnerabilities are just unfixable. You can’t block them because there’s no clear pattern to the attack. You can’t fix the code because they’re buried in libraries and frameworks. \_And you can’t live with them because they’re incredibly dangerous. \_Java’s deserialization vulnerabilities are a perfect example where organizations are left with no good choices and a huge window of exposure. \_In this talk, Jeff will explore the use of “runtime application self protection” (RASP) to fix this type of problem. Jeff will talk about various approaches to RASP, including dynamic software instrumentation. \_He’ll also introduce a free and open source RASP agent designed to completely neuter deserialization attacks across the entire Java stack. \_He’ll show you how RASP agents can enable quick and effective defenses across an entire application portfolio, and should be part of your application security strategy today.\n\nJeff Williams\nContrast Security\nCTO\nA pioneer in application security, Jeff Williams has more than 20 years of experience in software development and security. Jeff is the CTO and co-founder of Contrast Security, a revolutionary application security product that enhances software with the power to defend itself, check itself for vulnerabilities, and join a security command and control infrastructure. Jeff also served as the Global Chairman of the OWASP Foundation for eight years, where he created many open-source standards, tools, libraries, and guidelines - including the OWASP Top Ten.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
