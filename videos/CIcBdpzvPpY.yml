description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://gsec.hitb.org/materials/sg2015/\n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\nOver the years RFID card cloning attacks have risen steadily in Red Team activity. While card cloning can be effective, entry isn’t always gained with this method alone. As Red Team members, we often focus too much on the card and not enough on the technology that supports it. Why settle for access to one door when you can have access to them all?\n\nPhysical Access Systems (PACS) have several components working together to ensure that doors and turnstiles lock and unlock when required. Many of these components require network access in order to function properly. Once installed and operational, these components are often forgotten by the physical security and IT departments. As many of these components are non-Windows machines that do produce findings during a vulnerability scan, the security department often overlooks them as well. This common situation leaves the PACS components exposed and mostly unmonitored, creating an ideal environment for an attacker.\n\nThis talk will move beyond the card and explore all of the PACS components. After an overview of the components and architecture, we’ll discuss their unique attack surfaces, and how to locate them. Finally, we’ll put all of the attacks together to achieve complete takeover.\n\nABOUT VALERIE THOMAS\n\nValerie Thomas is a Principal Information Security Consultant for Securicon LLC that specializes in social engineering and physical penetration testing. After obtaining her bachelor’s degree in Electronic Engineering, Valerie led information security assessments for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) before joining private industry. Her unique Defense and civilian background provides her with a solid understanding of intrusion detection, data loss prevention, and endpoint (in)security. Her electronic and RFID training became a crucial element of her physical security specialization. While some choose to focus on cyber of physical security, she has chosen to exploit the weaknesses of the combination of the two. As an ethical hacker and consultant she holds multiple industry certifications.\n\nValerie is the coauthor of “Building an Information Security Awareness Program: Defending Against Social Engineering and Technical Threats” with Bill Gardner. Throughout her career, Valerie has conducted penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, compliance audits, and technical security training for executives, developers, and other security professionals. She has provided briefings and workshops for DEFCON, Derbycon, Blackhat, and multiple BSides events"
