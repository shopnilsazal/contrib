recordingDate: 1529904520
description: "Tired of using a keypad or a remote to open your garage door? Do you ever get to work and wonder if you closed the garage? Problems with your numeric keypad in the Minnesota winter? I wanted to build a smart garage door opener that would allow me to use my phone to open the door and to check the status of the door on my phone from anywhere. I also wanted project to use my Raspberry Pi 3.\n\nIn this session you will learn about the basic hardware I bought to support the sensor and signaling needs of the system and how they connect to the Pi. I'll also go over the applications I wrote to handle the logic on the Raspberry Pi and phone. I'll cover the connections between phone and the system, the remote access, and how it all fits together. Learn how you can enhance the system with features like sending alerts when your door has been open for an extended period of time."
