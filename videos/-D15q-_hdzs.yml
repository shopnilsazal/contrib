description: "By, Aaron Patterson\nIn this talk we'll look at Rails view performance and implementation. We'll see how it currently works, and how it has changed. The process of changing and refactoring the code, including code inspection tools will be discussed so that applications outside of the Rails world can take advantage of the presented techniques. We will also discuss how to take care of cats, and which emoji is best.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FaTm/"
