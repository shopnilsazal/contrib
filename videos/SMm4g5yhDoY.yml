title: 'DEF CON 17 - Chris Paget - RFID Mythbusting'
recordingDate: 1384992126
description: "RFID MythBusting\nChris Paget Founder, H4RDW4RE LLC\n\nThis presentation is about challenging many of the popular preconceptions about RFID technology. \"Short-range\" will be shot down first (I'm aiming to set a half-mile world record in the Nevada desert just before Defcon), \"secure\" will be busted second (don't bring _any_ RFID tags unless you want them cloned), \"immune to electromagnetic pulse weaponry\" will fall last (and hopefully most spectacularly). I'll be covering a wide range of different RFID technologies from 125KHz to 900MHz, and releasing a whole pile of source code, schematics, and (with luck) a little magic smoke.\n\nUndeterred by his previous legal skirmishes, Chris Paget is still having fun playing with magnetic fields and RFID. If you see a tall guy wandering around the con with long hair, high heels, and a pile of home-made RF hardware, there's a good chance that a) it's him, and b) your RFID cards have just been cloned.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
