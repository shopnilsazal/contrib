description: "In this episode of GALs, we visit the Microsoft Reactor Space in San Francisco to interview Lauren Tran, a machine learning and artificial intelligence-focused software engineer in Microsoft Commercial Enigineering (CSE) team.\n\nLauren didn't necessarily plan on being a software engineer. She dual-degreed in marketing and CS and then went to work at Saks Fifth Avenue as a marketer. It was while working as a marketer that she saw that her passion for computer science could help her in marketing. As Lauren tells it, she got her masters in computer science in order to become a better marketer, but while there, found out machine learning was her true passion.\n\nYou can follow Lauren on Twitter @ltktran http://www.twitter.com/ltktran"
