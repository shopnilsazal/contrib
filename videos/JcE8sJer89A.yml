recordingDate: 1388418380
description: "Everyone talks about Rocket Internet: the biggest european startup-incubator which launched several new ventures all around the globe, but a few describe their experience, especially from a technical perspective: in this talk we will see how the tech team was formed and works at Namshi, Rocket Internet's venture in the Middle East. From recruiting new talents, to adopting new paradigms like SOA or new frameworks and patterns such as Symfony2 or automated testing we will see how a real-world business is facing the challenges which are common to most of the internet-based companies: the \"hassle\" of technology.\n\nhttps://joind.in/talk/view/9360\n\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/odino/a-rocket-internet-experience-forumphp-paris-2013\n\nhttp://www.afup.org"
