description: "\"Why you don't need design patterns in Python?\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - PyCharm Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nExactly 23 years have passed since release of one of the biggest IT classics - \"\"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\"\". Contents of the book had considerable influence on dominant programming languages of those days. However, design patterns were not glorified by everyone. Voices of rational critic appeared, pointing out that design patterns are just ways to compensate for missing languages features by tons of clumsy code. If one implements design patterns in Python by the book, they will get code that looks awkward, at best. This talk is to present Python's features that either simplifies or eliminates need for implementing design patterns. Even if you don't know what design patterns are - don't worry. You still may see some new interesting Python's features and their usage.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
