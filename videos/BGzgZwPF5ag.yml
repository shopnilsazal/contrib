description: "An open Gravimetric Phenotyping system Finding low-cost solutions to continuous plant monitoring for scientific purposes\nby Nathan Hughes\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nAn open source design for a Gravimetric phenotyping system for plant science.Commercial solutions tend to skip over technical information that leads toinaccurate results. We are developing a system suitable for scientificresearch\n\nWe have encountered a lot of issues with proprietary systems for gatheringresearch data. Therefore we have started designing our own and have made itfree and open source (https://github.com/NPPC-UK/Gravimetrics).\n\nWe have so far built a lot of the software and hardware designs in order tooperate a gravimetrics system for watering and recording data on plants\n\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 14:00:00"
