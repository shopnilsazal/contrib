title: 'Reaktor Breakpoint 2018: Bodil Stokke, Immutable data structures and why you want them'
recordingDate: 1528989417
description: "There's a discrepancy between the careful attention to mutability and immutability in Rust itself and the data structures available in the standard library. The only way to update a Vec with an immutable ref is to clone it first, which could get expensive. But what else can you do?\n\nTurns out there's a number of data structures out there that make it cheap and easy to do immutable copies and updates. Some are so simple it's ridiculous, some are anything but, and we're going to dive into some of the more useful ones, how they work, why you should care, and how to best implement them in Rust.\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018.

In her spare time, she works as a developer for Future Ad Labs, a London based startup that wants to make advertising a productive member of society. Her favourite pony is Pinkie Pie."
