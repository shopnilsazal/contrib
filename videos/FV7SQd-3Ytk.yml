title: 'DEF CON 18 - Craig Heffner - How to Hack Millions of Routers'
recordingDate: 1383941201
description: "Craig Heffner - How to Hack Millions of Routers\nThis talk will demonstrate how many consumer routers can be exploited via DNS rebinding to gain interactive access to the router's internal-facing administrative interface. Unlike other DNS rebinding techniques, this attack does not require prior knowledge of the target router or the router's configuration settings such as make, model, internal IP address, host name, etc, and does not rely on any anti-DNS pinning techniques, thus circumventing existing DNS rebinding protections.\n\nA tool release will accompany the presentation that completely automates the described attack and allows an external attacker to browse the Web-based interface of a victim's router in real time, just as if the attacker were sitting on the victim's LAN. This can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the router, or to simply log in with the router's default credentials. A live demonstration will show how to pop a remote root shell on Verizon FIOS routers (ActionTec MI424-WR).\n\nConfirmed affected routers include models manufactured by Linksys, Belkin, ActionTec, Thompson, Asus and Dell, as well as those running third-party firmware such as OpenWRT, DD-WRT and PFSense.\n\nCraig Heffner's experience in IT security includes system and network analysis, wireless and networking security and vulnerability discovery, and he is currently employed as a Senior Security Engineer for Seismic LLC. He frequently publishes various tools, papers and vulnerability reports, and has a special fondness for embedded devices, particularly any whose descriptions include the words \"wireless\" or \"Web based administrative interface\".\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
