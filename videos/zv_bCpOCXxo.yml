description: "Building CLI Apps for Everyone by Terence Lee\n\nMany projects rely on command-line tools to provide an efficient and powerful interface to work.\n\nBuilding tools for everyone can be difficult, because of conflicting environment or OS.\n\nHow can we build command-line apps that work for everyone and still write Ruby?\n\nThis talk will discuss how to use mruby-cli to build cross-platform apps in Ruby.\n\nOur goal will be to build a CLI app using mruby and produce a self-contained binary that can be shipped to end users.\n\nSince mruby is designed to be embedded and statically compiled, it's also really good at packaging ruby code.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H12H/"
