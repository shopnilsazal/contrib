description: "by Lukas Bulwahn\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nOn FOSDEM 2014, Tilmann Ochs, Daniel Wagner and I presented researchactivities to define, motivate and implement a software platform forautonomous driving systems using open-source software. On FOSDEM 2017, we re-evaluate this effort and critically review its progress, its success and itsfailure. We discuss on-going software development activities, technicalinfluences for selecting the communication middleware and the operatingsystem, and the economics of automotive software development with implicationson use and development of open-source software.\n\nSince 2013, Tilmann Ochs, Daniel Wagner and I have been working on researchactivities to define, motivate and implement a software platform forautonomous driving systems using custom-off-the-shelf open-source software. OnFOSDEM 2014, we presented our understanding of future automotive software andour plans to use pre-existing open-source software for implementation of acollaborative automotive base platform.\n\nNow, three years later, it is time to re-evaluate this effort and criticallyreview its progress, its success stories and its failures. In this talk, wepresent our main assumptions in 2013, and give some insights in on-goingsoftware development activities supporting our ideas. Then, we evaluate towhich extend we were successful to implement these ideas, to which extend wecould improve our understanding, and how this has refined our plans.\n\nOn the technical side, we discuss the factors that influence the selection ofthe communication middleware and the underlying operating system of anautomotive platform for autonomous driving systems. On the business side, wediscuss the economics of automotive software development and implications onuse and development of open-source software in the automotive domain that weencountered.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:00:00"
