description: "Enforcing Your Code of Conduct: Effective Incident Response by Audrey Eschright\n\nNow that your event or project has a code of conduct, how do you ensure it's effective? Are you prepared to deal with incident reporting and to resolve issues that come up? How can you tell if your code of conduct is actually working?\n\nI'll draw on several years of experience working with code of conduct outreach and enforcement on open source projects, user groups, and a major conference to show you the steps to take to make sure your code of conduct is an effective tool for inclusion, safety, and building a stronger community.\n\nWe'll talk about reporting processes, documentation, creating a team or committee to handle reports, what responses are or aren't effective, and dealing with problems in the heat of the moment."
