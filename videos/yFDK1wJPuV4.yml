description: "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#HITB2012KUL (OCT 10-11) REGISTRATION NOW OPEN\nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/ \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPresentation Materials: http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012ams/materials/ \n\nCloud services such as Amazon's EC2 and IBM SmartCloud allow users to create and share virtual images (AMIs) with other users. In addition to these user-shared images, the cloud providers also provide AMIs that have been preconfigured with popular software such as open source databases and web servers.\n\nThis talk explores both the privacy and the security risks associated with renting and using public AMIs from cloud computing providers. We will present SatanCloud, our automated system that we used to analyze and test over 5,000 server images provided by Amazon in its four data centers of US, Europe and Asia. From our analysis, we discovered that both the users and the providers of public AMIs are vulnerable to security risks such as data leakage, unauthorized access, malware infections, and loss of sensitive information.\n\nABOUT DR. MARCO BALDUZZI\n\nDr. Marco Balduzzi holds an MSc. in computer engineering from the university of Bergamo and a Ph.D. in applied IT security from Télécom ParisTech. He has been involved in IT security for 10 years with international experiences in both industrial and academic fields.
