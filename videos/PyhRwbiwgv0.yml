description: "Itamar Syn-Hershko\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/dotnetfringe/sdkwdw/\nIn this (technical!) talk, we celebrate the resurrection of the Lucene.NET project, a search engine library for the CLR, that is now closer than ever for a new release. We will discuss the field of search technologies and the drastic changes it has seen in the past few years, and how Lucene.NET fits in that landscape.\nWe will show various use cases for Lucene.NET, talk about what&#39;s new in the upcoming Lucene.NET 4.8.0 version and give some helpful advice for long time users."
