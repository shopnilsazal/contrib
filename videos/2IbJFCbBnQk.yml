description: "RubyConf 2016 - Building a Better OpenStruct by Ariel Caplan\n\nOpenStruct, part of Ruby's standard library, is prized for its beautiful API. It provides dynamic data objects with automatically generated getters and setters. Unfortunately, OpenStruct also carries a hefty performance penalty.\n\nLuckily, Rubyists have recently improved OpenStruct performance and provided some alternatives. We'll study their approaches, learning to take advantage of the tools in our ecosystem while advancing the state our community.\n\nSometimes, we can have our cake and eat it too. But it takes creativity, hard work, and willingness to question why things are the way they are."
