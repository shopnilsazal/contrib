title: 'Frustration Driven Development By Evan D. Light'
recordingDate: 1347550633
description: "Everyone draws inspiration and motivation from different sources.\n\nFor most, it's often frustration.\n\nWe make life decisions, define new features, or refactor code when we get too annoyed by current circumstances. This is where I admit that I have a low tolerance for frustration. Having been frustrated a great deal during my career, I'm going to discuss several anti-patterns that I've seen in code and how to use the Dark Side of the Force (frustration, anger, and rage) to escape from them."
