title: 'LA Ruby Conf 2014 - Addressing sexism to build a better Ruby community'
recordingDate: 1397336860
description: "By Hannah Howard and Evan Dorn\n\nDespite programs like RailsBridge and RailsGirls, gender disparities remain a persistent problem in technology. In the last year the coding community has been rocked by several incidents of shockingly overt sexism. The topic is uncomfortable for everyone, and attempts to address it often create new unpleasant conflicts. We will discuss the experiences of women in our community, and address the understandable (but often unhelpful) reactions men have to the issues. We will offer practical strategies and tools to address these issues and create a healthier community. Co-presentation by Evan Dorn and Hannah Howard of Logical Reality Design, Inc.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2t/"
