description: 'Deep Reinforcement Learning: Developing a robotic car with the ability to form long term driving strategies is the key for enabling fully autonomous driving in the future. Reinforcement learning has been considered a strong AI paradigm which can be used to teach machines through interaction with the environment and by learning from their mistakes. In this talk, we will discuss how to apply deep reinforcement learning technique to train a self-driving car under an open source racing car simulator called TORCS. I am going to share how this is implemented and will discuss various challenges in this project.'
