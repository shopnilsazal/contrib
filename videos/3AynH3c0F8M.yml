It was designed from the ground up to support the OCI image and runtime specifications. The design of containerd is carefully crafted to fit the use cases of modern container orchestrators like Kubernetes and Swarm. In this talk, we dive into design decisions that help containerd meet a diverse set of requirements for a growing container world. Developing an understanding of the decoupled components will provide attendees a grasp where they can leverage functionality in their platforms. By slicing the components of a container runtime into the right pieces, integrators can choose only what they need.\n\nAbout Stephen\nStephen Day is a software engineer at Docker. His many contributions to Docker ecosystem projects include SwarmKit and the version 2 specification for the Docker Registry HTTP API, and evolving the available models for container image distribution. He currently works on containerd and as a maintainer of the OCI Image Specification."
