recordingDate: 1488384657
description: "This GDC 2015 session from academic Todd Harper gives you the not-so-skinny on how games portray fatness and characters of size. What are our harmful, pervasive societal ideas about being fat and in what ways do fat characters in games, and the way they play, reinforce them? How do some games succeed in making fat characters that don't fall into easy pitfalls? How does being fat sometimes cross over with things like gender? Probably most importantly: what are the things designers can do to make players of all body types feel good playing their work?\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
