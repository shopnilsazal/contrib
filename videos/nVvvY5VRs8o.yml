description: "Git is the most widely used version control tool today, but what is actually happening when we perform a `git add` or a `git commit`? To answer this question I'm going to walk through a small implementation of Git in Haskell. Along the way we'll touch on functional data structures, content-addressable stores, and parser combinators. At the end we'll analyse an entire Git repository and talk about the practical applications and limitations of what we've built. My hope is that this knowledge will help you be less frustrated the next time you see a cryptic Git error message!\n\nGit is the most widely used version control tool today, but what is actually happening when we perform a `git add` or a `git commit`?
