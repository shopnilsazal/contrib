description: 'Object-oriented Programming (OOP) dominates the industry. Most developers have experience with OO, but are new to functional programming. To help bring them to functional programming, we developed ooErlang, an extension of Erlang that fully supports OO with simpler syntax than previous approaches. This talk presents how we have implemented ooErlang and how to start using it.'
