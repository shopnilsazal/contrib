title: 'jQuery Conference SF 2012 Faster jQuery With Category Theory by John Bender'
recordingDate: 1345933199
description: "Math: It's certainly not something you expect to see at a conference about JavaScript, but even this far from its ivory towers it has an important role to play. Together we'll build two categories, see how satisfying the Functor laws shines light on a simple optimization for our jQuery method chains, and derive a plugin/method standard that will allow us to easily use this optimization in our applications.\n\nDon't worry, you don't need to know any Math to understand and enjoy the talk, just some curiosity and a desire to make your jQuery based JavaScript faster!"
