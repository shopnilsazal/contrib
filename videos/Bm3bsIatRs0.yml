description: "Marisa Fagan - Be a Mentor!\nBreaking in to the Information Security field isn't easy. The web of certifications, skills, and credibility is hard to climb through without the help of someone who's been there. Many of us would not be here today without the guidance of a mentor. The Information Security Mentor Match-up program is here at DEF CON to help those people new to the field meet with seasoned pros who know the value of mentoring. Whether you're a researcher, pen tester, network admin, number jockey, hardware hacker, or beer connoisseur, there's someone else at DEF CON that shares your passion. To participate in this session, sign up at http://infosecmentors.com.\n\nMarisa Fagan is Errata Security's Security Project Manager, responsible for managing the custom development lifecycles required for the tools in the Hacker Eye View suite, as well as managing the research and consulting engagements. She specializes in rapid development of network security tools and is recognized for her research in threat modeling and identity theft. Ms. Fagan has a BBA degree from Georgia State University focused on IT Project Management and Information Security. Ms. Fagan has presented her work at SummerCon 2009 in Atlanta, GA and at Security B-Sides, 2009 in Las Vegas, NV & 2010 in San Francisco, CA.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
