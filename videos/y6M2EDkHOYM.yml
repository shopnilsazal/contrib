description: 'Decision Intelligence is an emerging discipline that unifies machine learning, complex systems, predictive analytics, causal reasoning, optimization, and more into a unified framework that overcomes limitations of the current data stack that are faced by organizations worldwide. Just as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), along with associated tool companies like Rational, brought the discipline of design to software development, decision intelligence is a methodology, supported by software, that overcomes a number of barriers that have limited the practical use cases of the analytic / data stack. In particular, Decision Intelligence brings engineering practices to decision making, treating the “decision” as an engineered artifact. This means that best practices from design, agile development, and more can now be used to evolve decisions over time, creating a continuous “organizational learning” framework in diverse settings such as the US government and transnational corporations.'
