description: "Microservices Patterns with NGINX Proxy in an Istio Services Mesh [I] - A.J. Hunyady, NGINX Inc\n\nBuilding a cloud native application is only half the battle; running it reliably is the other half. \n\nNGINX, the leading provider of ingress controller functionality in Kubernetes environments, has partnered with Istio to enhance Sidecar proxy capabilities in the Istio' Services Mesh architecture. \n\nA service mesh is highly dependent on the strength of the proxy, and NGINX is the most powerful service proxy in the market. It offers a small footprint high performance engine with advance load balancing algorithms, caching, SSL termination, API gateway, extensibility through broad range of third-party modules, sciptability with Lau and nginScript and various security features with granular access control. \n\nMicroservices also require a Web Server to be deployed side-by-side with the service proxy. While optional, deploying NGINX as Web Server technology provides additional benefits in performance, manageability, security and the overall monitoring of the Application. \n\nNGINX is already used by more than half of the top 100,000 websites and this talk will describe how NGINX in Istio environments is a natural extension of this technology. \n\nOur demo will show a sample application running in a Kubernetes/Istio/NGINX environment and we will answer questions from the audience.\n\nAbout A.J. Hunyady\nA.J. Is a technology enthusiast and a Silicon Valley veteran. He founded Zokets where he developed software for managing containerized services in highly dynamic environments. A.J. is now at NGINX, where he leads innovations in new product development."
