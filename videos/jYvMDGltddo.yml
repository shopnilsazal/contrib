language: English
recordingDate: 1464386339
description: "Craig Fender and Ravindra Punati, eBay\n\neBay is a well-known leader in online marketplaces with more than three billion page views per day. eBay is the sixth largest compute footprint on planet Earth enabling billions of dollars of commerce among upwards of 162 million people in over 100 countries. The infrastructure contains tens of thousands of compute nodes running thousands of applications, hundreds of databases, multiple thousands of network devices. Failures can happen at any infrastructure, platform, framework, application stack layers or even at the availability zone(region) level. Our goal is to ensure that failures at a certain stack layer are not compounded by cascading to various upstream layers causing total system/service outage. This topic addresses automation capabilities that our engineering teams have built to mark up/down data and service paths to ensure the consistent user experience."
