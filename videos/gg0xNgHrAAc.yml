description: "Storing your data in kernel space: an excellent bad idea! By Kamal Marhubi\n\nNormally, when you make a database, you store your data in memory, or on disk. User memory. But what if you stored your data in the kernel's memory instead? This is a bad idea, but it is possible! Imagine a database where all the data is in pipes! I'll talk about how to build this, why pipes are so cool, and, briefly, how you can use them to do smart things instead of silly things.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/KEoh/"
