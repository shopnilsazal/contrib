description: "This week, James is joined by friend of the show Josh Weber, HockeyApp Program Manager, who talks to us about the next step of DevOps after Continuous Integration, which is Delivery. Gone of the days of emailing around install files and packages as we can eliminate all of this tediousness and delight our testers with Continuous Delivery. Josh shows us not only how we can delivery a development build of Xamarin iOS and Android applications with every commit, but also how Visual Studio Team Services enhances the release management process. He walks us through gated releases to HockeyApp and then straight to Google Play in just a few seconds. Join in on the Continuous Delivery fun on this weeks The Xamarin Show.\n\nShow Links:\n\nFollow @joshuawebermsft: https://twitter.com/joshuawebermsft\nFollow @HockeyApp: https://twitter.com/HockeyApp\n\nFind James on Twitter: http://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno \nGitHub: http://github.com/jamesmontemagno\nBlog: https://montemagno.com\nand his weekly development podcast Merge Conflict: http://www.mergeconflict.fm\n\nNever Miss an Episode: https://twitter.com/thexamarinshow\nFollow @TheXamarinShow\n\nUseful Links:\n\nXamarin Developer Center & Blog: https://developer.xamarin.com/\nXamarin and Azure: https://www.xamarin.com/azure\nMobile DevOps: https://www.xamarin.com/mobile-devops\nXamarin University Self-Guided: https://university.xamarin.com/self-guided\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree"
