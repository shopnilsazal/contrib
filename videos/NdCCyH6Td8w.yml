description: "by Magen Wu, Senior Consultant at Rapid7\n\nAbstract: \nThe problem with most compliance, such as PCI, is that when you manage a project, design, or code only to the line of compliance, there are going to be security gaps. When you have gaps, your risk gets higher, and it becomes more costly to fill those gaps later. \nThis talk will describe the requirements of some compliance frameworks and the gaps that can occur when you’re following the bare minimum secure coding practices that they require. The presenters will also give suggestions on how to address these gaps and how to plan for future risk as your applications and dependencies grow and requirements change. \nThe approach will look at prioritizing security initiatives to better manage risk as they pertain to application security and create more efficient processes as they relate to software development. Together, these will increase the ability to prevent, detect, and respond to security events that threaten your apps while supporting compliance initiatives. \nAt the end of the presentation attendees will have a good understanding of how a more mature security posture and implementing a framework that also allows you to follow secure coding practices can help harden even your more robust applications, as well as address compliance requirements for application security.\n\nMagen Wu has over 10 years of specialized IT experience, is a Sr. Consultant with Rapid7's Strategic Advisory Service group.
