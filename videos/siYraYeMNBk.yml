description: 'Android is getting huge fast. Learn about Ruboto, a project to bring Ruby to Android. See a demo of the IRB app, then delve into ruboto-core, a platform for writing full Android apps in pure Ruby. Also take a quick look at writing apps in Mirah, Charles Nutter''s JVM language that has a Ruby-like syntax but compiles directly to Java code, meaning that it is just as fast as Java.'
