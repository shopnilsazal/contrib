recordingDate: 1462957100
description: "PyData London 2016\n\nThis will showcase the data analysis features of Julia, a new high-performance, dynamic language for technical computing. We will give an overview of the various data, statistics and graphics libraries, interfaces with Python and R, as well as outline future directions for this new and exciting language.\n\nJulia has a rapidly developing ecosystem of packages for data analysis. This talk will give an introduction to some of these, such as Distributions.jl, DataFrames.jl and Gadfly.jl. We will also demonstrate how to leverage existing libraries in Python and R, via the PyCall.jl and RCall.jl packages. Finally, we will describe the future plans, funded by a Moore Foundation grant.\n\nSlides available here: https://gist.github.com/simonbyrne/53b3bd29d2f347fc4f6539cf7d2442e1"
