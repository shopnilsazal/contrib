title: 'Kyran Dale - Getting it out there: Python, Javascript and Web-visualizations'
recordingDate: 1397475980
description: 'Python makes hacking data into shape a far less painful process than it used to be, and has some fairly powerful visualization tools to boot. But what happens if you want to get those results onto the browser, something that is becoming increasingly imperative for much modern data-science? For the foreseeable future that means playing nicely with Javascript (JS) and, due to a recent arms-race among the JS engines, the good news is that JS is quite capable of handling the demands of cutting, splicing, filtering and visualizing etc. large data-sets interactively. This interativity, the ability to play with data in real-time, is day to the night of static, pre-rendered images. This talk will focus on web-based data-visualizations, showing what JS can do on the client-side, how Python can provide the perfect back-end partner and some of the challenges and gotches experienced by the speaker. The key JS libraries discussed will be D3 (data driven documents) and Angular. Python old faithfuls Scipy, Numpy, and Panda will get the usual head-nod.'
