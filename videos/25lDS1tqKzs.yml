recordingDate: 1430406567
description: 'Experiments are currently underway to determine whether or not we live in a simulation. But what does it mean if we do? And if we live in a game, how can we break it? In this Cosmos-inspired talk from GDC 2015, game developer Dain Saint (Auditorium, Splice) analyzes the universe from the point of view of a game designer, picking at the seams to provide a humorous and insightful look at our place in the simulation and the lessons we can learn from the longest running game in existence.'
