description: "Lightning Talk: Non-tech Contributions to The Tech Community by Elisha Tan\n\n\"I'm not skilled enough a programmer to contribute\" is a common response I get when I ask programmers why don't they contribute to the open source community. In this lightning talk, I share some ways that you can contribute to the community (hint: it's all non-technical and anyone can do it) even if you're half a decent coder like me."
