description: 'Come kick off the Xbox @ GDC 2018 show, with a preview of some of the cool things the Xbox team will be sharing throughout the week and then hone in sharing data and best practices from one of the best digital stores in the world. Presenters will focus on sharing data that attendees don''t usually see â€“ such as what genre generates the best long tail sales, how can they best model revenue predictions for the life of their game, and how they can avoid simple mistakes that can cripple sales. Data will be drawn from more than 4 years of sales results on Xbox across more than 700 games!'
