description: "By, Katrina Owen\nIt's not your fault. Code rots. We don't hold entropy against you, but we expect you to give a damn.\nThis story is about code that brings new meaning to the word 'legacy'. The accidental discovery of this body of code provoked a moral crisis. I wanted to pretend I hadn't seen it, yet I couldn't justify tiptoeing quietly away.\nThis talk examines the dilemmas we face when balancing our choices today with their cost tomorrow.\nIt's not your fault. Even so, it is your responsibility.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/G0HR/"
