description: "DevOpsDays NYC 2016 - Programming your Infrastructure by Dave Long\n\nIn this talk, we will see what happens when we stop looking at our infrastructure development as just a bundle of scripts and start looking at it as an application. We will go over various concepts in the programming world that can be carried into infrastructure development, including local development, test-driven code, modular applications, and static code analysis. Out of this talk, I hope to give operations engineers a new way to build out systems and feel more confident in the stability of their infrastructure."
