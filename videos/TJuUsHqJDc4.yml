description: "by Jan-Christoph Borchardt\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nDesigners are not allergic to open source – it often is just quite difficultand frustrating to get involved. Gladly there are some easy methods to make UX& UI folks feel welcome and get them contributing! :) This talk will show themethods we use at Nextcloud – which successfully helped us build an active andwelcoming design team.\n\nSome of these methods include: \\- Describe clearly what your project does \\-Being welcoming to designers \\- Involving design from the start \\- Usingdesign tags in the issue tracker \\- Have an easy landing page to get involved\\- Cultivating a culture of design-driven decisions \\- and more! :)\n\n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 10:30:00"
