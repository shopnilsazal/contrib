description: "Markus Zapke-Gründemann - Writing multi-language documentation using Sphinx\n[EuroPython 2014]\n[23 July 2014]\n\nHow to write multi-language documentation? What tools can you use? What mistakes should you avoid? This talk is based on the experiences I gathered while working on several multi-language documentation projects using Sphinx.\n\n-----\n\nInternationalized documentation is a fairly new topic. And there are different approaches to do this. I will talk about how Sphinx internationalization support works, which tools and services I use and how to organize the translation workflow in an Open Source project. Finally I will have a look at what the future of internationalization in Sphinx might bring."
