description: "Jamie Butler,VICE - Catch the Hookers!\nVICE - Catch the Hookers!\n\nRootkits are the backbone of software penetrations. They provide stealth and consistent access to a computer system. Rootkits employ technology for covert ex-filtration of data, IDS evasion, and anti-forensics. Rootkit technology is now incorporated into the most deadly of threats, network worms. Serious security professionals must understand rootkit technology in detail. Commercial anti-virus technology is woefully inadequate at dealing with the threat. There is no magic security tool that will protect your system. Rootkits now employ specific methods to evade many security utilities, including host-based intrusion prevention systems (HIPS).\n\nThis talk focuses on specific rootkit threats and more importantly, how intrusion-prevention software can be designed to detect these threats. Illustrated threats include direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM), hooking, and runtime code patching. We will release a new version of our freeware tool, called \"VICE\", that can detect many of these rootkit threats.\n\nJamie Butler is the Director of Engineering at HBGary specializing in rootkits and other subversive technologies. He is the co-author and a teacher of \"Aspects of Offensive Root-kit Technologies.\" Prior to accepting the position at HBGary, he was a senior developer on the Windows Host Sensor at Enterasys Networks, Inc. He holds a MS in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Over the past few years his focus has been on Windows servers concentrating in host based intrusion detection and prevention; buffer overflows; and reverse engineering. Jamie is also a contributor at rootkit.com."
