description: "Skrooyoo & Grifter - Resurrecting the Scene Through Local 'Hacker' Meetings\nMany people are interested in bringing their local underground community closer together by organising meetings for those in the area. While this is certainly a good idea, doing it successfully is not as simple as it sounds.\n\nGrifter (Salt Lake City 2600) and skroo (Los Angeles 2600) intend to cover the more relevant points of starting local meetings. Topics discussed will include identifying if your area needs a meeting, setting things up, choosing a location, running the meeting, and keeping it going successfully. This will be done in a Q&A session based on the speakers' experiences both attending and running 2600 and other meetings. Questions from the audience will be actively encouraged."
