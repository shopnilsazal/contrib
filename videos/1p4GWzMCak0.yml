description: "Ignite: Think Globally, Act Locally by Sa'ad Raouf\n\nLearn how a Fortune 100 energy company that generates revenues of approximately $34.5 billion and employs approximately 34,000 people has embraced DevOps. What are the challenges facing a large company as they attempt to realign development and operations into one homogenous group? Get exposed to the secret of change, where instead of fighting the old, we invent the new. Study how security was mitigated when we embraced the cloud, experience the challenges we faced when we attempted to embrace open source software. Stories will be told, and our lessons learned will be shared for all to learn from."
