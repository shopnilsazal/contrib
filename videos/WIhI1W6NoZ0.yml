description: "Filmed at PyData London 2017\n\nDescription\nIntroduction to image classification using Tensorflow. I will provide a Notebook for you to try things out.\n\nAbstract\nWe will discuss how Convolutional Neural Networks work and how you can apply them to the task of image classification. This will be illustrated by an example using real pictures of German speed limit signs which we will process with Tensorflow and Keras as a frontend. I will provide you with a Notebook so you can follow along without installation or try out the examples later at home.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
