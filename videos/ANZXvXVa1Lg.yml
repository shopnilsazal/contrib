description: 'Joshua Block just gifted us with the 3rd edition of "Effective Java", but almost 10 years have been past since the last edition. Now we have a whole generation of Java developers that could benefit from this knowledge - but lost the past wave. It''s about time to revisit all of this wonderful content, and upgrade your skills to the latest versions of the Java platform.
