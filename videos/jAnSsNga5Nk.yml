description: "By, Jason Clark\nMy dad's a programmer, so I grew up with PCs and--more importantly--programming tools my friends didn't have. I learned early on that text I typed could make these machines do anything I could imagine.\n\nNow I have kids of my own, and as my daughter's learning letters and arithmetic, I'm scheming to give her similar experiences. Come along on the journey of introducing her to programming. We'll talk about the software we used, the puzzles and games we made, what worked and what didn't. Along the way we'll pick up tips on teaching programming to novices of any age.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGYR/"
