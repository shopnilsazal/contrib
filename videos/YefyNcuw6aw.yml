title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2018 - Ben Barnes - Failing gracefully with EitherT'

description: "Handling errors in a principled manner is an important aspect of writing production code. Drawing on our experience of writing production systems in Haskell, we believe that for a large class of problems, using the EitherT monad transformer is a simple and effective pattern to handle errors. We suggest that often, several mechanisms for error handling appear in code bases (including exceptions and the use of free monads) and that it will be of interest to intermediate Haskellers to see a principled approach that only uses EitherT to accomplish this.\n\nBen started his career in hardware and robotics, but was swiftly lured away by functional programming. Nowadays he assembles functions into larger functions for Data61.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
