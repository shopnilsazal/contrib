description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Yannick Badoual, Deezer.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-33\nSlides link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HQ8Prdt3emkWQZWt_H5H6KwmCijyl4bBUrhjC2QiiF4/edit#slide=id.gc6f73a04f_0_0\n\nDagger is the most popular dependency injection framework for Android development. Recently Google released version 2.10 and 2.11 to simplify a lot the usage, but do you really understand how the magic works when using AndroidInjection.inject(this)?\n\nFrom AndroidInjectionModule to ContributesAndroidInjector, we'll see how to use the new versions and what is really happening under the hood when calling this code.\n\nA basic understanding of how to use Dagger 2 is strongly recommended to fully understand this talk.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
