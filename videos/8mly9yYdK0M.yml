title: 'Analysing flight safety data with Python - Jes√∫s Martos, Alejandro Saez Mollejo'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510572961
description: "Description\nIs aviation the safest means of transport? Is flying now safer than in the previous decades? Which are the main accident causes? During this talk we will try to answer these and other questions using the capabilities of libraries such as pandas, cartopy or Bokeh.\n\nAbstract\nA continuous improvement in flight safety is a common goal for all public agencies and private companies. Many analysis are published every year but, would it be possible to reproduce those same results? During this talk a real open database from the American National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will be used in order to show to the audience the potential of Python to read, clean and manipulate data. Among other questions, we will try to identify the most common causes of aviation accidents and their consequences. During the talk the importance of open data will be highlighted.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
