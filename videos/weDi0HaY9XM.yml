description: "At the end of the day, what pays the bills is not the amount of RxJava operators you've used, or how cool your Kotlin code looks compared to what you had with Java.

As such, join me on a journey that will assess and assert what it means to sell in-app products on Android today, and what it means for the business. We will understand several aspects of their implementation, testing, A/B testing and monitoring, as well as highlighting what we can look forward to in the future.\n\nDisclaimer: no real money will circulate in this presentation."
