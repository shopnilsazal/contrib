description: "by Marton Balassi\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nImplementing use cases on unified data platforms. Having a unified dataprocessing engine empowers Big Data application developers as it makesconnections between seemingly unrelated use cases natural. This talk discussesthe implementation of the so-called BigPetStore project (which is a part ofApache Bigtop) in Apache Spark and Apache Flink. The aim BigPetStore is toprovide a common suite to test and benchmark Big Data installations. The talkfeatures best practices and implementation with the batch, streaming, SQL,DataFrames and machine learning APIs of Apache Spark and Apache Flink side byside. A range of use cases are outlined in both systems from data generation,through ETL, recommender systems to online prediction.\n\nSession type Lecture\n\nSession length 30 min + 5 min discussion\n\nExpected prior knowledge / intended audience Basic exposure to Big DataSystems\n\nSpeaker bio MÃ¡rton Balassi is a Solution Architect at Cloudera and a PMCmember at Apache Flink. He focuses on Big Data application development,especially in the streaming space. Marton is a regular contributor to opensource and has been a speaker of a number of open source Big Data relatedconferences including Hadoop Summit and Apache Big Data and meetups recently.\n\n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 15:30:00"
