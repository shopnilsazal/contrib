recordingDate: 1432226170
description: 'While the quality of photo-realistic real-time graphics in games is advancing daily to near feature-film quality, Arc System Works'' RED team took a completely different approach with Guilty Gear Xrd in pursuit of an impressive art style that would stand out even in this competitive environment. The team''s mission was to rebuild a classic 2D fighting game within a modern full-3D graphical framework, while maintaining all of its old-school 2D charms. In this GDC 2015 talk, technical artist Junya C Motomura will discuss the art and programming R&D, as well as all the artistic decisions, that lead to the award-winning results.'
