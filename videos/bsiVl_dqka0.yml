recordingDate: 1392162226
description: "spoonm and HD Moore, Bubonic Buffer Overflow\n\nThe Metasploit Framework has progressed from a simple network game to a powerful tool for administrators and security analysts alike. Over the past several months, the Framework has been enhanced with improved exploit techniques and a truly advanced suite of payloads. This presentation provides a background on what exploit frameworks are, what they can provide you, and why you should be using one. A live demonstration will highlight many of the advanced features of the Framework, describe how they can be used to accomplish a variety of tasks, and show that the technology for \"hacking like in the movies\" is already available today. \n\nAttendees will be provided with an early-access copy of version 2.2 of the Metasploit Framework; which includes a number of techniques and exploit modules that are not publicly available anywhere else. Additionally, this release is the first version of the Framework to include a development kit for creating your own custom modules.\n\nSpoonm is currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in Software Engineering. Much to the detriment of his early morning classes, he is an active researcher in many different security areas, most notably in the exploitation and post-explotation process. He has developed several post-exploitation tools, and between working as a security consultant, and asm wielding, he currently spends most of his\ntime working on the Metasploit Framework.\n\nHD Moore is one of the founding members of Digital Defense, a security firm that was created in 1999 to provide network risk assessment services. In the last four years, Digital Defense has become one of the leading security service providers for the financial industry, with over 200 clients across 43 states. Service offerings range from automated vulnerability assessments to customized security consulting and penetration testing. HD developed and maintains the assessment engine, performs application code reviews, develops exploits, and conducts vulnerability research."
