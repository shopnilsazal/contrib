description: "By, Davy Stevenson\nSoftware is approached mainly from the angle of engineering. Let's step back and take a look at software as science. How can we increase the quality of our code, tune our minds to efficiently solve problems, and correctly reapply known solutions to new problems? Learn a few new tricks about how to easily benchmark your code and how to analyze code complexity.\n\nFramed by the story of my own path from would-be Physicist to happy Software Engineer, let's look at using the scientific method as a guide for software development.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGYI/"
