description: "Michał Bultrowicz - Python microservices on PaaS done right\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nLately, there's a lot of talk about microservices but not enough\nconcrete examples and case studies. I want to change that by showing:\n\n - how thinking in PaaS terms can lead to robust and scalable designs;\n\n - what infrastructure and automation you need to set up to go along smoothly;\n\n - how to get real time metrics of your apps; \n\n - what makes Python good for microservices;\n\n - what is Python's performance relative to some alternatives.\n\n**Prerequisites for the talk:**\n\n - some experience with web development in Python;\n\n - basic knowledge of RESTful web services."
