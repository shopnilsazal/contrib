description: "RustConf 2016 - Using Generics Effectively by Without Boats\n\nTraits and type parameters are the core mechanism for abstraction in Rust. Other languages also have features like these, but few leverage them nearly as much as Rust does. This talk will describe the many powerful uses for Rust's generics system, how generics can be used as a replacement for tools like inheritance and duck typing, and how to leverage this system to write good, clean code."
