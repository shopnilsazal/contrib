title: 'Beyond Code: Repository Mining with Clojure - Adam Tornhill'
recordingDate: 1435946345
description: 'To understand large legacy systems we need to look beyond the current structure of the code. We need to understand both how the system evolves and how the people building it collaborate. In this session you''ll learn about a Clojure application to mine social information such as communication paths, developer knowledge and hotspots from source code repositories (including Clojure itself). It''s information you use to improve both the design and the people-side of your codebase. We''ll also look at some interesting libraries like Incanter and Instaparse before we discuss the pros and cons of writing the tool in Clojure.'
