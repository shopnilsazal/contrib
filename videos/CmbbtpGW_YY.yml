description: "SQL to NoSQL to NewSQL and the rise of polyglot persistence Paul Dix\n\nThe last ten years have brought many new developments in databases. Previously developers had SQL as the dominant and nearly only paradigm for databases. Then in the mid-aughts the rise of NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, HBase and others brought new paradigms and options to developers. Over the last few years there seems to have been a swing back to NewSQL or scalable databases that support the SQL standard. In this talk we'll look at some of the new database models like document, data structure, time series, and key/value. I'll look at use cases where these different models end up being a better fit for their problem domains than SQL, the previous one true language to rule them all."
