description: "Intro to semantic annotations for geographic web maps in HTML Pulling Schema.org, Dublin Core, Microdata, JSON-LD, HTML and SVG all together.\nby Malte Reißig\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nLeaflet.annotate aims to transform the BSD-Licensed web mapping libraryLeaflet into a semi-automatic, semantic authoring environment for creators ofgeographic web maps. The plugin extends the options for the LeafletJS StandardAPI elements Marker, CircleMarker, Popup, ImageOverlay and GeoJSON so you canpublish these map elements in HTML semantically annotated ‐ and therewithmachine readable web maps. While there is quite some effort already around thedevelopment of new geospatial data catalogs (which are awesome) this pluginturns the focus onto geographic web maps. Acknowleding that, de-facto, somemaps already are data catalogs themselves, they are just not that wellrepresented in HTML so that other programs can extract and re-use theinformation people collect in them.\n\nLeaflet.annotate aims to transform the BSD-Licensed web mapping libraryLeaflet into a semi-automatic, semantic authoring environment for creators ofgeographic web maps.
