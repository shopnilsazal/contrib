description: "No* as not only. Couchbase is an OpenSource Document Database. Like most NoSQL DBs, it is distributed, highly available and schemaless. But unlike most NoSQL DBs, it also supports SQL querying with N1QL, a SQL query language for JSON documents, and Fulltext search through Bleve.\n\nBut No* means not only, and Couchbase is not only a NoSQL DB. With its integrated Caching layer, you don't have to deploy any additional caching solution, everything you do is already in memory. And for mobile developers, Couchbase features a full mobile solution which resolves the offline synchronization problem.\n\nIn this presentation we will go over Couchbase's architecture and see what makes it possible to have such a versatile database. We'll end this presentation with some deployment or code examples."
