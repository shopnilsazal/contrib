description: "Title: More time for Open Source work with the help of the Pomodoro Technique\nPresented by: Matthias GÃ¼nther\n\nYou know the constraints: Day job, time for your family, urge to hack, visiting the local user group, and start a new project about the latest rocket science technology you need to learn. There is never enough time for all this stuff at once. This talk will present the time management method, called Pomodoro. Learn how to work time-boxed, get rid of distractions, focus on a single task for 25 minutes, and relax for couple of minutes to free your mind. We all love Open Source work and Pomodoro will help you to hack on your beloved babies in a time-boxed way to get more done in less time.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGbn/"
