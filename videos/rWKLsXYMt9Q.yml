description: "Made Open: Hacking Capitalism\nTODD BONNEWELL MAN WITH A MESSAGE, MADEOPEN.COM\n\nThe game is Capitalism. The rule makers are the banks, corporations and governments. This presentation is about playing a game that is rigged by the rule makers, and winning in such fashion that the game is never the same. If you like breaking things and building them back up, or are a person, please at least watch this at a later time. I forgive you for not attending, but you will not forgive yourself for missing it.\n\nTodd Bonnewell is a person with a message. Nothing Todd has done or said in his professional past in more important than the message. Todd works for the people at MadeOpen.com."
