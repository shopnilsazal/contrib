description: "I think a lot of developers secretly harbor the desire to start their own company, but don't realize that running a business means a lot more than just cutting great code all day long. Others may be at a point in their career where they feel stalled out and might want to see if management is right for them. Moving from a software role to a management role doesn't mean you have to sacrifice all your technical/coding skills, but it does mean you need to cultivate some new ones.\n\nJessie is the Director of Engineering at Lookingglass Cyber Solutions. She enjoys mentoring young developers and is an active coach and participant with RailsGirls. Though she mostly spends her day herding cats, on occasion her devs let her into the code repo to do some damage.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG09/"
