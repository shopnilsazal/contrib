description: "How Learning Ruby Made Me a Better Objective C Programmer by: Michael Harper\n\nAfter working with C++ in the early 90s, I ended up on a project on NeXT for two years. The programming language on NeXT was Objective C which seemed like C++'s weird uncle. Java came along and kept me busy for the next several years while Apple simultaneously built Mac OS X atop NeXTStep. In 2006, I heard on the Java Posse podcast about Ruby on Rails. Compared to Java EE, Rails was a dream come true. After spending several years with Rails and simultaneously finding my way into Mac and iOS development, I started to understand why Objective C was much cooler than I had realized."
