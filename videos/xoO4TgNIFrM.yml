recordingDate: 1502694948
description: 'Web Components are a set of standards currently being produced by Google engineers as a W3C specification that allow for the creation of reusable widgets or components in web documents and web applications. The intention behind them is to bring component-based software engineering to the World Wide Web. The components model allows for encapsulation and interoperability of individual HTML elements. (Wikipedia) During this talk I will convey to you the significance of using Web Components and explain why web developers need them. I’ll talk about the state of browser compatibility and how to use Web Components in browsers that are not compatible. I’ll demonstrate to you how to use Web Components and explain how they work. A significant part of this talk is about creating your own Web Components, which I’ll compliment with live coding examples. To fully understand this talk the attendees should have a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.'
