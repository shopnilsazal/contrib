description: "View slides for this presentation here:\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/PyData/py-data-talk\n\nPyData NYC 2014\nSQL is still the bread-and-butter of the data world, and data analysts/scientists/engineers need to have some familiarity with it as the world runs on relational databases.\n\nWhen first learning pandas (and coming from a database background), I found myself wanting to be able to compare equivalent pandas and SQL statements side-by-side, knowing that it would allow me to pick up the library quickly, but most importantly, apply it to my workflow.\n\nThis tutorial will provide an introduction to both syntaxes, allowing those inexperienced with either SQL or pandas to learn a bit of both, while also bridging the gap between the two, so that practitioners of one can learn the other from their perspective. Additionally, I'll discuss the tradeoffs between each and why one might be better suited for some tasks than the other."
