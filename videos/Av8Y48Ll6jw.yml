description: "Keynote: 13 Ways Designers Screw Up Client Presentations by Mike Monteiro\n\nThe hardest part of design is presenting work. We’ve seen people who’ve done amazing work get up in front of a client and lay eggs. We’ve also seen people do mediocre work and wrap clients around their little finger. Optimally, you want to do good work and present it well. We’d rather have a good designer who can present well than a great designer who can’t. Work that can’t be sold is as ineffective as the designer who can’t sell it. Presenting is a core design skill. In this session, Mike will go over the most common mistakes designers make when presenting their work, and how to avoid them.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HMtj/"
