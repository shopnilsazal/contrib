description: "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Managing Production Systems with Kubernetes in Chinese Enterprises - Xin Zhang, Caicloud\n\n\"Kubernetes has rapidly evolved from theoretical trials to empirical deployments in an increasing number of US enterprises. However, the Chinese enterprises unveil different traits when it comes to requirements, platforms, and the tech-savviness of the operators, rendering the upstream guidelines and references a far cry from enabling successful Kubernetes production usage in varying circumstances.\n\nIn this talk, we leverage our unique experience with using Kubernetes to manage production systems in large-scale Chinese enterprises, with a stab at stereotyping different categories of common usage scenarios not covered by the official guidelines. Peering through the mist, we aim to glean insights into the usage patterns in different industries (carrier, finance, e-commerce, and traditional, etc) to use Kubernetes more effectively.\n\nWe start with the standard Kubernetes features people are most thrilled about, then unearth the glitches and pitfalls when running Kubernetes in the wild, including dealing with Internet inaccessibility, unique security requirements, dancing with traditional, stateful applications, etc. Finally, we share our open source efforts and tools to tackle those issues in pursuit of wilder kubernetes adoption.\"\n\nAbout Xin Zhang\nXin is currently CEO and co-founder of Caicloud (https://caicloud.io), a startup that fosters Kubernetes community in China (https://kubeacademy.caicloud.io) and provides Kubernetes-based products and services for Chinese enterprises. His team has helped tens of well-known Chinese enterprises to run Kubernetes in production, and has held multiple Kubernetes meetups with over a thousand attendees in total.\n\nBefore founding Caicloud, Xin was a Googler for almost 4 years working on Cluster Management and Google Cloud Platform, with close relationship to Borg and the early Kubernetes (in fact, he has engaged in bringing Kube-ui to life with Kismatic folks).\n\nXin obtained his Ph.D in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, during which he has published 30 research articles in top-notch venues and delivered over 10 academic speeches at international conferences around the globe to over thousands of audience.\""
