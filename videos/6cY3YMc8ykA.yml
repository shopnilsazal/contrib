description: "Hello? Yes, this is Synth - Making Hardware better with the Web\n\nJoin me on a fast paced ride through the exciting possibilities, mind boggling bugs, impossible challenges and fun experiments of building a unique, stable and successful web application to augment a hardware synthesizer using cutting edge browser APIs.\n\nJan Krutisch\nCurrently in transition to becoming a proper grey beard, I’m old enough to remember a world without the web, or cyberspace as we used to call it. \n\nI’m a web developer by day, working on tools for designers and developers at Flowbyte, and a musician and general digital artist by night. Actually, usually I sleep at night, but you know what I mean."
