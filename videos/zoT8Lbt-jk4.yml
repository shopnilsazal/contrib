description: "By David Padilla\n\nThese days, whenever you say that you're building a web application with Ruby, its almost implied that you will be using Rails to do so.\n\nWell, what if you don't want to use Rails? Or Sinatra? Or any other Framework for that matter. What if you just want to roll your own code for routing, controllers, rendering and models?\n\nJoin me in this live coding experiment, I promise no slides and a lot of live coding action while we build an application from scratch using nothing but good old fashioned Ruby and a little Rack.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4c/"
