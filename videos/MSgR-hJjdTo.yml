description: "By, Justin Searls\nYou grok SOLID. You practice TDD. You've read Sandi's bookâ€¦twice. You rewatch Destroy All Software monthly. You can pronounce GOOS. You know your stuff!\n\nBut some of your coworkers say your code is too complex or confusing for them. You might rush to conclude that must be a them problem.\n\nBut doubt lingers: what if they're right?\n\nAfter all, the more thought we put into a bit of code, the more information that code carries. Others must extract that embedded meaning, either by careful reading or shared experience. Sometimes boring code is better. Let's figure out when to be dull."
