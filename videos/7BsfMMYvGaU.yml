description: "\"Mary had a little lambda\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-12 - Arengo]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nMary had a little lambda,\na function pure as snow.\nAnd for every program that Mary wrote,\nthe lambda was all she needed to know.\n\nPython’s lambda, a tiny anonymous function, can be useful in a pinch when you’re feeling too lazy to type that extra d-e-f. But did you know that behind this little lambda is actually one of the most powerful &amp; elegant abstractions in the history of computer science? \n\nThe lambda calculus, dating back to the work of lambda shepherd Alonzo Church in the 1930's, lets us represent our programs - all their logic and data - as pure, anonymous functions, using nothing but (a whole lot of) lambda. Let’s take it for a spin and see what we can create: booleans and conditionals, integers, arithmetical operators, data structures… you name it. With some determination, and a little squinting, we might even see lambda do the impossible: reconcile object-oriented and functional programming. You heard it right: lambda can do it all!\n\nJoin me as we explore its astounding computational power, and walk away with a deeper respect and admiration for the almighty little lambda.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
