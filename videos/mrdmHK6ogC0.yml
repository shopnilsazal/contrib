description: "What if Shakespeare Wrote Ruby? by Adam Cuppy\n\nDid you know that Shakespeare wrote almost no direction into his plays? No fight direction. No staging. No notes to the songs. Of the 1700 words he created, there was no official dictionary. That’s right the author of some of the greatest literary works in history, which were filled with situational complexity, fight sequences and music, include NO documentation! How did he do it?\n\nIn this talk, we’re going “thee and thou.” I’m going to give you a crash course in how: Shakespeare writes software.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Lg6W/"
