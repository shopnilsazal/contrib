description: "Droidcon Paris 2014 \nStéphane NICOLAS, Groupon\n\nDuring the last few years, we have all assisted or participated to a small revolution on Android : annotation processing. Most libs now rely on annotation processing during build to pre-compute a lot of stuff that will boost them at runtime. Let's think about Dagger, ButerKnife, Hugo, RoboGuice, BoundBox, Memento, IcePick, etc.\n\nNevertheless, writing an annotation processor is far from obvious as it offers an API that is very difficult to understand. The main idea of this session is to suggest an alternative technology (or a complement in some cases) : post-compilation processing and byte code manipulation ?\n\nThis session is an in-depth review of byte code manipulation in Java and its limitations on Android. We will also explore a few techniques and libraries that make it simple to write a post compiler byte code processor, with gradle and maven examples.\n\n2 libraries will be featured during the session : \n* AfterBurner : \n* Mimic\n\nSee how to eliminate all boiler plate from your favorite libraries and boost your apps."
