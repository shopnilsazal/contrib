language: English
recordingDate: 1528833337
description: "Aprameya Rao, or AP as we call him, is a Principal Software Engineer working on the Resiliency core subsystem of Service Fabric: \nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric/tree/master/src/prod/src/Reliability\n\nSpecifically, AP is the owner of the Reconfiguration Agent or RA, which is a critical component inside the Failover collection of system services (the agent is implemented as a daemon). There is a lot to the art of reconfiguration, so this is a long Going Deep episode. It's also really easy to understand given AP's ability to explain things in a readily understandable fashion. \n\nTune in and meet AP. You'll learn everything you'll ever want to know about ServiceFabric Reconfiguration!\n\nLink to referenced SF paper on ACM: \nhttps://blog.acolyer.org/2018/06/05/servicefabric-a-distributed-platform-for-building-microservices-in-the-cloud/\n\nCheck out the RA source code here:\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric/tree/master/src/prod/src/Reliability/Failover/ra\n\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree"
