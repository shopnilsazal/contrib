description: "Broward Horne: MEME Hacking\n\nBroward Horne is a software developer with a diverse background, including several years as an electronic technician at Litton and Teradyne and as a sysadmin at a major University. Broward also has a business background, doing contract work for the United States Department of Transportation on experimental pen-based systems, early wireless LANs and two-dimension barcoding. Since 1999, he has been in java software development, mostly for sales and ordering systems in large corporations. Prior to 1991, he hacked internal networks at two major electronics companies out of curiosity, but never intentionally damaged or sabotaged any system or network. For the past thirteen years, Broward has done business intelligence and analysis against various internet data sources, including the usenet newsgroups, Dice.com, Monster.com, Google and other search engines. This analysis kept him gainfully employed throughout the Dotcom Crash. More at http://www.realmeme.com"
