description: "By Brian Sam-Bodden \n\nBehavior-Driven Development and Acceptance Testing are heavily intertwined and in many aspects are one and the same. Both focus on starting at the outer layers of your application by concentrating on what matter to users; behavior. In this session/workshop we'll talk about how testing can be used both for specifying your application yet to be develop expected behavior and as accurate, running documentation that can be used to validate your stakeholder's acceptance criteria. We'll talk about the different types of testing and do a few hands-on exercises to flesh out a Rails application with RSpec and Capybara.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGa3/"
