description: "PiOSoned POS - A Case Study in iOS based Mobile Point-of-Sale gone wrong - Mike Park\n\nMobile Point of Sale (POS) are becoming more and more common in a wide variety of retail outlets. And why not, it adds speed and convenience to shopping and can increase a retailers ability to sell. But POS and Mobile are hard to get right and secure. What happens when you try to combine the two on trendy iOS devices and rush your solution out the door? \n\nBased on multiple mobile tests conducted by Trustwave SpiderLabs' application security, Mike Park will walk through the typical mobile POS apps for iOS and show how and why they can be attacked, often with no sign an attack is going on. \nMike will cover technological shortcomings, coding mistakes and the common misunderstanding of the underlying platform that almost always occur and result in an insecure application. This will include some hardware card reader devices that default to allowing almost no security. \n\nOutline \n1. Introduction \n2. Why Mobile POS? \n3. Why iOS? \n4.
