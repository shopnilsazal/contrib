title: 'ndarray: Modular multidimensional arrays for JavaScript - Mikola Lysenko (@MikolaLysenko)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1444124199
description: 'Multidimensional arrays are a fundamental data type, with diverse applications in geometry, graphics, vision, DSP, machine learning, scientific computing and much more. Many of these tasks are also interesting for web applications, but exploration here is hampered by the lack of efficient multidimensional array in JavaScript. ndarrays solve this problem by introducing a simple data structure for manipulating slices of higher dimensional data. This talk will cover how ndarrays work, and give an overview of the growing modular ecosystem around ndarrays'
