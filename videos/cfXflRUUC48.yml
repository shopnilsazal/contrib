description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2017 by Fabien Devos, Wealthfront.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-37\nSlides link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ehc6B78kWnX23W1SZvUtpP42LMsSJwdEvD0WIkgACmk/mobilepresent?slide=id.p\n\nActivities get destroyed when you rotate the screen and have a complex lifecycle. Using Fragments is error-prone and their lifecycle is even worse. How would you like a Screen that doesn't get destroyed on rotation, and a navigation as simple as calling goTo(screen)? That's what modern Android development should look like.\n\nIn this presentation you'll learn how we implemented a single Activity architecture with a custom navigation system, and how we use it everyday in production thanks to a library we created: Magellan (https://github.com/wealthfront/magellan).\n\nType: Android development\nExperience: intermediate\n\nAlex Karp Production"
