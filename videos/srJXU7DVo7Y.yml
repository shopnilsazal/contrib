description: 'Before hackers got involved in cybersecurity the industry was focused on products and compliance. Security was security features: firewalls, authentication, encryption. Little thought was given to vulnerabilities that allowed the bypassing of those features. Hackers came along with the idea that you use offensive techniques to simulate how an attacker would discover vulnerabilities in a networks, a system, or an application. Offensive skills have been on the rise ever since and now the best way to secure something it to try and break it yourself before the attacker does. This history will be told from a member of the hacker group The L0pht who lived the arc from the underground, to consumer advocates, to speaking at the U.S. Senate, to forming a 200 employee security consultancy, to schooling Microsoft and changing how people build software. Attendees will learn why we need the kind of tools hackers build to secure our systems and why we need people who are taught to think like hackers, ''security champions'', to be part of software development teams.'
