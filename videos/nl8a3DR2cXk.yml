He has a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Washington and a M.S in Mathematics from Louisiana State University.\n\nAbstract summary\n\nKnowledge at Pinterest:\nPinterest is building the world’s largest catalog of ideas. These ideas are embodied in billions of Pins and well over 100 million Users and Boards which, together, form a complex picture of our users and their interests. The goal of the Knowledge team is to leverage our unstructured data (images, videos, and text), and structured data (user curated data, partner generated content, and engagement signals) to model users and their interests so we can help them discover fresh, diverse, and personalized new ideas. In this talk, we go into some detail on the progress we’ve made so far."
