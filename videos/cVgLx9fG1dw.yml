title: 'Software Security Initiative Capabilities - Where do I begin? - Jim DelGrosso - AppSec Ca 2016'
recordingDate: 1458611297
description: "A software security initiative (SSI) often gets started via one of three common capabilities - penetration testing, code review, or some sort of secure design review (e.g., threat modeling). This talk will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each capability and show how they fit as part of a mature SSI.\n\nJim DelGrosso\nCigital, Inc.\nSenior Principal Consultant\nJim DelGrosso, Principal Consultant, has been with Cigital since 2006. In addition to his overarching knowledge of software security, he specializes in Architecture Analysis, Threat Modeling and Secure Design. In fact, he was a catalyst for creating Cigitalâ€™s current Architecture Analysis practice. Jim is also the Executive Director for IEEE Computer Society Center for Secure Design (CSD).\n\nAre the threat modeling myths keeping you from initiating this key secure design activity? Join us to get the facts; find out how easy it is to get started. We will attempt to debunk 6 recurring myths. Hopefully you will agree with us once you have a few of the facts? We aim to place participants onto a path to successful threat modeling. Please join Jim DelGrosso and Brook Schoenfield as we squash misunderstandings and industry accepted disinformation.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
