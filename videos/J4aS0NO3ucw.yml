description: "Chris Withers | Thursday 16:30 | Assembly Room\n\nWhenever we come to write a script, there's a bunch of stuff we don't really want to deal with: command line option processing, config files, user preferences, logging, structuring code for testability.\n\nThis talk goes through the problems you're likely to hit with each of these and ways that you can both \"do it right\" and not have to implement it all yourself.\n\nLink to slides: http://slides.simplistix.co.uk/PyConUK2017-boring-things/#/title"
