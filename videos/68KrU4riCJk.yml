description: "KEYNOTE MATERIALS: \nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2013ams/materials/ \n\nKEYNOTE ABSTRACT: \n\nReading the headlines today, we see that security issues frequently involve employees, their accounts, and their machines. And yet many security professionals view their employees as a lost cause. Between bad passwords, phishing, and lost machines, these users seem to present unbounded risk. And managing that risk often creates tensions between business needs and security needs.\n\nIn this keynote I'll share some of Twitter's efforts to maintain a connection with our people, including some experimental results of efforts to reconnect with our user base and some thoughts on how we can re-think the problem to take back the front line.\n\nABOUT BOB LORD\n\nBob has held a number of security and software engineering management positions over the past 20 years at companies such as Andersen Consulting, Netscape, AOL, Sun (iPlanet/AOL alliance), and Red Hat. He ran corporate security at Netscape before leading the cryptography teams there and subsequent companies. He was the Engineering Director responsible for the Certificate System, a PKI server used in numerous sensitive environments. He is currently the Director of Information Security at Twitter."
