description: "Building Rocket by Sergio Benitez\n\nRocket is a web framework for Rust that delivers simplicity, reliability, and performance -- a rare combination. Rocket's ability to deliver in all three areas is largely enabled by Rust's code generation facilities. Based on developer input, Rocket generates code that eliminates boilerplate and leads to more robust, secure, and predictable web applications.\n\nThis talk dissects Rocket and its code generation by describing how Rocket is built. Special attention is placed on elucidating Rocket's use of present and future code generation facilities in Rust."
