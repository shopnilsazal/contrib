System administrators and hostile parties no longer had the ability to read a users email. With functionality similar to Hushmail, the world was introduced to an open source solution that they themselves could host.\n\nAt Defcon 12, CryptoMail.org will be releasing to the public a major advance in its technology. Users will now be able to transparently and securely communicate with PGP users. Users will be able import their private PGP key set upon account creation as well as external PGP public keys.\n\nArchitect Joshua Teitelbaum and project manager Peter Leung will present the overall design of the architecture, the infrastructure and the logistics of the upcoming CryptoMail Email System release. We will demonstrate the technology integration inside the new release for the first time. At the conference, you will have the chance to preview the\nnew release.\n\nJoshua Teitelbaum developed the CryptoMail Email System and founded CryptoMail.org in 2000. Joshua is the primary developer and technical lead of the Email system. He communicates with other developers and members around the world to discuss future features and improvements to the CryptoMail Email System. Besides information security, Joshua holds an active interest in building scalable trading systems for broker/dealers and portfolio managers.\n\nPeter Leung joined CryptoMail.org in 2000 as the webmaster and the project manager.His main task in the organization is to direct, manage, and organize the software release process. Peter collaborates with other members to document the Email system and informs everyone about the organization's activities.
