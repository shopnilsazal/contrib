description: "Torus: Focusing Storage for Kubernetes - Barak Michener, CoreOS, Inc.\n\n\"If Kubernetes can orchestrate computation across any cluster, on any cloud, how can we do the same for orchestrating storage? Further, can storage for Kubernetes be easily managed by Kubernetes? CoreOS is attempting to bring solid, free persistence across a cluster through the Torus project, starting as a prototype and being built publicly with the open source community. This talk will discuss:\n* The needs of the community around container storage\n* The goals and architecture of Torus\n* How Torus integrates with Kubernetes FlexVolumes\n* Managing Torus using Kubernetes\n* What weâ€™d like to see in the future for Kubernetes-native storage\"\n\nAbout Barak Michener\nBarak Michener is a backend Go developer working on Torus for CoreOS and lead maintainer of Cayley, an open source graph database. Previously at Google he worked on Knowledge Graph using structured data to improve Google Search after some time focusing on music research and multi-model machine learning algorithms. He calls his alma mater of Berkeley home after years in NYC."
