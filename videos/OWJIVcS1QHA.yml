description: "Tom Croucher, Uber Technologies, Inc.\n\nIn an organization growing as rapidly as Uber (when every week engineers add 10 new services to the stack) itâ€™s impossible to know every engineer. How do Uber SRE ensure our systems are reliable?\n\nIn this talk, I will explain how Uber SRE focused on shaping the reality that the engineering teams operate in to create a culture of reliability. Given a specific set of constraints engineers are smart and solve problems, so we made one of the primary roles of the SRE team to create a reality that made reliability part of the DNA of services, not just an add-on."
