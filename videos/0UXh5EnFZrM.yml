description: "\"Converting the Ad-Hoc Configuration of a Heterogeneous Environment to a CFM, or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Chef\", by Dimitri Aivaliotis, EveryWare AG\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this video are those of the speaker(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the USENIX Association.**\r\n\r\nThere are as many ways of managing the configuration of heterogeneous systems as there are engineers trying to solve this problem. This talk explores one way of converting an ad-hoc configuration management system into one codified in Chef. We will describe extensions to the FreeBSD and Solaris providers and explore cookbooks to detail how the configuration is modeled. But why would you actually use a CFM? Will it make your job easier? Can you own it? We will reveal these answers and more."
