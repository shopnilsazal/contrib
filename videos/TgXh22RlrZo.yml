description: "We are releasing a new tool for discovering bluetooth devices and automatically probing them for information. Effectively we have created a new tool with an airodump-ng like display for nearby bluetooth and bluetooth low energy devices. We will discuss the challenges with finding bluetooth devices, as well as how we have overcome them using both standard bluetooth adapters and optionally ubertooth hardware. If you have ever wondered why no one released an effective tool to see all the bluetooth in the area then come by, learn a little, and leave with a tool you have always wanted. Blue Hydra will discover and track bluetooth and bluetooth low energy devices in the area, regardless of being in discoverable mode, and tracks data (bluetooth version, services, etc) as well as meta-data (signal strength, timestamps) over time. We will be going over how bluetooth operates on a high level, and how we were able to discover and track nearby devices. A deep understanding of the bluetooth protocol was not needed to develop Blue Hydra (we stood on the shoulders of giants) and will not be required to use Blue Hydra or understand it's output.\n\nZero_Chaos is a well known wireless hacker who helps to run the Wireless Village at DEF CON and the Wireless Capture the Flag at numerous conventions (including DEF CON ). Always quick to open his mouth when he probably shouldn't, Zero enjoys talking to people about wireless hacking and teaching anyone with an interest.\n\nGranolocks is a long time experimenter and developer at Pwnie Express. He has a broad set of interests including long walks in the woods, travel to exotic locations and hacking the planet. Known far and wide for his dry wit and backrubbing skills, the Q&A session is not to be missed."
