description: "Chris \"TheSuggmeister\" Sumner, alien and Alison B -Weaponizing Cyberpsychology and Subverting Cybervetting for Fun, Profit and Subterfuge\n\nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-19/dc-19-presentations/Sumner-Byers-Alien/DEFCON-19-Sumner-Byers-Alien-Weaponizing-Cyberpsychology.pdf\n\nAlmost everything we do in life leaves a personality footprint and what we do on social networking sites like Facebook is no exception. During this talk we will examine:\n\n* What it is possible to determine about someone's personality from their facebook activity\n* What to look for when you are trying to identify the most pwnable person in a group\n* Whether facebook activity can indicate a high probability of having or developing depression\n* How you could weaponize 'sockpuppets' by giving them certain personality traits\n* Cybervetting and your rights (or lack of rights) to privacy\n* Steps you can take to manage or even alter your 'NetRep' (online reputation)\n\nWe conducted a research project called 'The Big 5 Experiment' with the objective of determining whether there were any significant correlations between a user's facebook activity and their answers to a personality questionnaire called 'The Big Five Inventory'. The Big Five Inventory was created by Prof Oliver John, to measure personality dimensions known as the Big Five.\n\nConsidering the ubiquity of personality tests such as the Myers-Briggs for employee selection and the growing number of companies adding cybervetting to their selection processes, it can only be a matter of time before we see the two activities merge and at what cost to society?\n\nYou should leave the talk with an insight into how the Big 5 Experiment results could be used in attack and defense strategies. Should you wish to conduct your own research, related or not, you should also learn from what proved a rather fascinating experience in carrying out the experiment.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/onlineprivacyfoundation\n\nFull description and Bio available here: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-19/dc-19-speakers.html#Sumner"
