description: "As a Sysadmin, why should you learn more about Go? Well, imagine not having to mess around with old versions of Python or Ruby(I'm looking at you RHEL 5), or fall back to C when you need to improve performance. Imagine being able to deploy self-contained binaries that don't require yet another runtime to be installed on the target system. If that sounds awesome to you, then you're going to love Go.\n\nUsing packages found in the standard library and Go's unique language features, I'll show you how to solve common Sysadmin problems in new ways, and set the stage for tackling a whole new set of problems that our current tools have made way too complicated.\n\nAttend Go for Sysadmins and learn how to:\n\n* Leverage the Go standard library for everyday system administration tasks\n* Make practical use of go routines and channels in system utilities and scripts\n* Follow best practices for managing, building, and distributing Go projects\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FOPR/"
