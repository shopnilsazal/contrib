description: "How to Stop Hating your Test Suite by Justin Searls\n\nYour app is a unique snowflake. Your tests are too… but they shouldn't be!\n\nYears helping teams write better tests has taught me one thing: consistency is crucial. Inconsistent tests slow teams down, wasting time to understand how each test works. Deciding on conventions—even arbitrary ones—can prevent tremendous pain later.\n\nThis talk will introduce a ready-to-fork Test Style Guide of carefully-considered rules and templates for Rubyists. You can customize it to fit your preferred tools, too. Soon, you'll be on your way to having more consistent tests that are much more fun to maintain!"
