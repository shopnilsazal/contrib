By breaking down their design, we'll learn concrete principles that go deeper than \"Englishy:\" principles like \"composability\" and \"deep domain integration.\" We'll learn how to get precise about the API design and boundaries of our DSLs. We'll write a micro-DSL that is usable without monkeypatching.`\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H1VU/"
