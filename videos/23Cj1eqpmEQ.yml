title: 'RubyConf 2010 - Ruby Mendicant University: A New Way to Learn by: Gregory Brown'
recordingDate: 1428421692
description: 'With the hopes of making some waves in the technical education space, Gregory Brown started Ruby Mendicant University in the summer of 2010 as a free online school open to anyone looking to improve their Ruby craftsmanship. In a period of just 10 days, 47 donors pitched in a total of $3050 to help offset the cost of content creation. Shortly afterwards, 87 students took and passed an entrance exam that earned them a seat in one of the upcoming training sessions. Needless to say, the program was off to a great start. But how have things gone since then? At RubyConf X, Gregory will give the community an inside look at what it''s like to be an RMU student. You''ll get to see the kinds of projects students are working on as well as the open source tooling we''ve built up to support RMU itself. You might also learn a thing or two about the virtues of goal-driven learning along the way.'
