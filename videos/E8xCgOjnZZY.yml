recordingDate: 1405436560
description: "Back in September 2013 I taught a class of 12 middle-school aged girls to write code in Scratch on the Raspberry Pi and program simple electronic circuits. This was a workshop for the Philadelphia non-profit TechGirlz.\n\nI created 5 structured activities using Scratch and simple electronics that covered both good programming principles and the basics of electronic circuits. https://github.com/atroutt/scratch-pi\n\nI will be sharing these structured projects as a template for other beginner workshops, and talk about what I learned by building and teaching this workshop.\nI'll cover\n\n    What can be effectively covered in a day?\n    How can you setup a workshop up to maximize fun and learning on the day\n    Demos of some of the best projects!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGYq/"
