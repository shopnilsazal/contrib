description: "RailsConf 2017: Distributed Tracing: From Theory to Practice by Stella Cotton\n\nApplication performance monitoring is great for debugging inside a single app. However, as a system expands into multiple services, how can you understand the health of the system as a whole? Distributed tracing can help! You’ll learn the theory behind how distributed tracing works. But we’ll also dive into other practical considerations you won’t get from a README, like choosing libraries for Ruby apps and polyglot systems, infrastructure considerations, and security."
