title: '#HITBGSEC 2016 SG Conference Track D1 - Stumping The Mobile Chipset - A. Donenfeld & Y. Mordekhay'
recordingDate: 1474887027
description: "Following recent security issues discovered in Android, Google made a number of changes to tighten security across its fragmented landscape. However, Google is not alone in the struggle  to keep Android safe. Qualcomm, a supplier of 80% of the chipsets in the Android ecosystem, has almost as much effect on Android’s security as Google.\n\nWith this in mind, we decided to examine Qualcomm’s code in Android devices. During our research, we found multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities in multiple subsystems introduced by Qualcomm to all its Android devices in multiple different subsystems.\n\nIn this presentation we will review not only the privilege escalation vulnerabilities we found, but also demonstrate and present a detailed exploitation, overcoming all the existing mitigations in Android’s Linux kernel to run kernel-code, elevating privileges and thus gaining root privileges and completely bypassing SELinux.\n\n=== \n\nAdam Donenfeld is a lead mobile security researcher at Check Point with vast experience in the mobile research field. From a young age he has been hacking and reverse engineering for fun and profit. Prior to Check Point Adam served in an Israeli elite intelligence unit, as a security researcher. In his free time, Adam studies German.\n\n---\n\nYaniv Mordekhay is a seasoned software engineer and researcher. He has over two decades of experience under his belt, coding in most programming languages known to the mankind. His tinkering took him from punch cards, through embedded devices and all the way to modern cloud-computing platforms. Currently a mobile security researcher at Checkpoint, he devotes most of his efforts to excavating the dark secrets of Linux and Android inner workings. You may occasionally spot him in his natural habitat on GitHub and StackOverflow, trying to contribute to way too many projects. When not glued to his computer screens, Yaniv spends time with his family exploring abandoned castles and brewing his trademark spiced coffee."
