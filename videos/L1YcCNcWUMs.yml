description: "Cutting-edge web interfaces surprise and delight users with their interactivity. Can we somehow enable this next-generation user experience with our current rails templates and not rewriting our presentation layer in JavaScript?\n\nSync enables your rails partials to update on the client in real time. It can match the user experience of JavaScript MVC frameworks. This session will explain how Sync works and how to integrate Sync in an existing application. Prepare to have your mind blown.\n\nMike Moore believes software is written for humans first and computers second. He is a living breathing person with many quirks and interests.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0S/"
