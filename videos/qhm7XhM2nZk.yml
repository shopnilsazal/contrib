description: "Open Source for your Benefit by Courteney Ervin\n\n\"Open Source is good for you,\" they whisper to you while you drink your coffee. \"Just open source it,\" they say, hovering above your desk. \"FOSS & GTD,\" they scream, smiling broadly and leaning ever more intimately forward with so many, many teeth.\n\nYes, open source is an incredibly important element of the tech ecosystem, and it can be a valuable and meaningful part of your career as a software developer. However, it’s important to do open source with your own personal needs and goals in mind. In this interactive talk, we’ll explore a collaborative, take-charge approach to open source contributions that doesn’t sacrifice your individual flair.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/IG23/"
