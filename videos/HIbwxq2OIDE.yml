description: "Digital Engagement, Community, & Imagination by Natasha Marin\n\nWe use platforms like Facebook to find, connect, and build alliances with the people who can work together to co-create self-sustaining systems that promote our individual agendas. This talk will explore spaces that eclipse both the real and digital worlds. Marin will outline how she has used performance, poetry, and visual art as strategic communication tools to establish spaces for deeper engagement on topics from birth control and gender identity, to white privilege and racism. Her work with projects like Red Lineage, Miko Kuro's Midnight Tea, SPoCS (Seattle People of Color Salon) and #WhiteOrWrong allow the idea of community and imagination to grow and thrive through different levels of engagement, modes of connection, and methods of encounter.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VD9w/"
