description: "By, Joanne Cheng\nDuring the 1960's, computer scientists at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ explored the limits of computers through art and music. Some worked by themselves to discover push the boundaries of computer animation, others brought in visual artists and composers to collaborate on art experiments on Bell Lab's equipment after the work day.\n\nIn this talk, I'll talk about some of the experiments of computer scientists and artists during this time. We'll look at their influence on how we use computers today, and why we should embrace the spirit of experimentation and collaboration.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FkBM/"
