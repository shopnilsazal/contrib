Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nWrite Less Code, Use More Tools: How we Orchestrate 7M+ Builds/Month with Kubernetes + Nomad - Danielle Tomlinson, CircleCI (Any Skill Level)\n\nWhen we redesigned CircleCI from the ground-up in 2016 and 2017, we knew we needed a proper scheduling solution to run jobs efficiently across our resources. Proper isolation of CircleCI's infrastructure and individual customer builds was one of the core requirements of this undertaking: for security, scalability, and reliability, we had to make sure to keep our system separate from our users' jobs. In this talk, I'll share why we chose Nomad and Kubernetes to solve these issues over other tools, present the issues and obstacles we solved, and talk about how this setup is running for us in production ~10 months after GA.\n\nAbout Danielle\nDanielle is a Staff Software Engineer at CircleCI where she works on build infrastructure and operator tooling, ensuring fast and stable services for 7m builds/month. Before she started working on cloud infrastructure, she was an iOS developer for 8 years. She is also a maintainer of CocoaPods, a dependency manager for Mac and iOS developers."
