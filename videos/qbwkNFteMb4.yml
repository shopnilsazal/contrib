title: 'ArrrrCamp 2013 - Rails: Still the Best Framework for Bootstrapping'
recordingDate: 1388786588
description: "By Anothony Eden\n\nThis year we launched a new product in 6 weeks - from initial commit to accepting customers. We could have used a number of languages to build KBSimple, but we chose Rails to bootstrap it. The reason is simple: Rails is still the best framework for bootstrapping new web applications.\n\nIn this talk I'll go through the 6 week evolution of the product, talk about the various gems and techniques that were essential in reducing the amount of time it took to launch, and talk about some of the challenges we faced along the way.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4B/"
