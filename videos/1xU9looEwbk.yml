description: "Scaling Spark – Vertically: The mantra of Spark technology is divide and conquer, especially for problems too big for a single computer. The more you divide a problem across worker nodes, the more total memory and processing parallelism you can exploit. This comes with a trade-off. Splitting applications and data across multiple nodes is nontrivial, and more distribution results in more network traffic which becomes a bottleneck. Can you achieve scale and parallelism without those costs?\n\nWe’ll show results of a variety of Spark application domains including structured data, graph processing and common machine learning in a single, high-capacity scaled-up system versus a more distributed approach and discuss how virtualization can be used to define node size flexibly, achieving the best balance for Spark performance."
