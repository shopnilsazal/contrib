description: "By Peter Baumgartner\nDjango makes it easy to build a site and get it running on your laptop, but how do you go from there to a site that can gracefully handle millions of page views per day?

Topics will include caching, uWSGI, Varnish, and load balancing.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FPWi/"
