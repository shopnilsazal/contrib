description: "Tackling Large Ruby Refactorings with Confidence (and Science!) by Jesse Toth\n\nAt GitHub, we recently replaced a large subsystem of our application – the permissions code – with a faster and more flexible version. In this talk, I’ll share our approach to this large-scale rewrite of a critical piece of our Rails application, and how we accomplished this feat while both preserving the performance of our app and proving the new technology over the course of the project.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Ghc9/"
