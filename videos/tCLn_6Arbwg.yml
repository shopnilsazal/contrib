description: 'Whether they''re playing, streaming, or viewing, you''re probably only hearing about a fraction of your audience''s negative online experiences with your game. And that means that you''re likely only hearing about a fraction of what they do to deal with those bad experiences. In this talk, members of Xbox Research will share their research learnings about the psychological, situational, and structural reasons behind why bad experiences are underreported. They''ll also share how you can use those learnings to help your players have a better time online with others.'
