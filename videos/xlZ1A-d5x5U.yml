description: "By Rosie Hoyem and Sonja Hall\n\nThe next five years of web development are all about data applications and APIs. Learn how to leverage Rails-API to build them. This modular subset of a normal Rails application streamlines the process of building a standardized API that can easily be consumed by a wide-array of applications. We'll explore example applications using Rails API, demonstrating the expanding utility of this framework as user interfaces extend beyond HTML into native applications and APIs.\n\nRosie writes code in Minneapolis at the Minnesota Population Center, a leading developer and disseminator of demographic data. She's a designer turned city planner turned energy policy nerd turned web developer and proud 2013 graduate of the Flatiron School in NYC.\n\nSonja is a U.S. Fulbright Scholar and recent graduate of the Flatiron School in NYC who is a developer at Venga in Washington, D.C. Inspired by design and the great outdoors, you can find her commuting on her road bike or hanging out with dogs when not mastering the art of Rails.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1B/"
