description: "When programmers describe code as 'procedural', it's generally not meant as a compliment. There is the belief that we have collectively moved pass such thinking and onto better paradigms. But a paradigm is no more than a pattern language, a family of solutions fit for a context. Change the kind of problem you are solving and you may find a different solution makes sense â€” even, in these days where pure functions battle it out with classy objects, procedural programming.\nThis talk takes a look at some of the past, present and future of procedural programming, looking at how there's more to it than many first assume, how it still informs language design and how it relates to other paradigms, such as functional and OO.\n\nEVENT: Build Stuff 2017\n\nPERMISSIONS: Build Stuff Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
