description: "RubyConf 2016 - To Clojure and back: writing and rewriting in Ruby by Phill MV\n\nAct 1 - State of Grace\n\nAfter many years of Ruby, we built our app in Clojure, why not. Clojure is a breath of fresh air. Learn a lisp today!\n\nAct 2 - The Fall\n\nIt's harder to succeed when you're in a new and different ecosystem. How Clojure contrasts with Ruby.\n\nAct 3 - The Wilderness\n\nRewriting your app is a bad idea but we did it anyways. How we came to that decision.\n\nAct 4 - Reconciliation\n\nHow I write Ruby has changed: a discussion."
