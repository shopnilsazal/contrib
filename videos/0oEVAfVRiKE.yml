description: "We all would like to know what users want, right? Then we could build it and get a lot of money for it. But how to find out without being psychic, can we ask them ?\n\nThe worst thing you can do is build the wrong thing. But how to know what is right and what is wrong? We don't have a crystal ball. Is our gut feeling the best we can do ?\n\nJoin me while I take you on a trip behind the scene of some of the most successful website in the world. I will share their secret with you. How they made it happen, how they decide what to build, when to build and how to make sure that it is what the users want. And of course how they made their fortune in the process of doing this."
