recordingDate: 1525865527
description: "Before you can have Big Data, you must collect the data. There are two popular ways to do this: with batches and with live streams. Apache Kafka has changed the way we look at streaming and logging data and now Azure provides tools and services for streaming data into your Big Data pipeline in Azure. This session will outline the different services in the Big Data Streaming ecosystem in Azure, how they work together, and when to use which including HDInsight Kafka and Event Hubs. We will also talk briefly about when using traditional ETL tools is a better idea.\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree"
