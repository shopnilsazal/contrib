recordingDate: 1530020697
description: "We think in words, we talk with words, we understand the world thanks to words. Metaphors take words to the next level explaining concepts that were escaping our understanding before. In 1980 George Lakoff revolutionised the linguistic and philosophic worlds when he studied how metaphors affect our thinking, how they influence our actions and even shape who we are. What happens with the metaphors that we use in the software Industry?\n\nIn this talk we are going to review the importance that metaphors have in our code quality, in the algorithms we choose, and the products we ship.\n\nAs a practical example, we are going to see why Microservices and Containers have been so successful in the past couple of years. Weâ€™ll try to understand why they have redefined how we package and ship products in our industry today.\n\nOMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
