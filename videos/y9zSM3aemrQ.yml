recordingDate: 1494856779
description: "Filmed at PyData London 2017\nwww.pydata.org\n\nDescription\nI use various Python libraries and methods from Graph theory and Information Retrieval to garner insight into the social dynamics of people searching for love and marriage on the Muslim marriage app 'MuzMatch'.\n\nAbstract\nDating apps have become the norm in modern society, with companies like Tinder, Bumble, Happn etc. boasting millions of users. OKCupid, an early entry into the online world of dating, were one of the leading companies to take advantage of the data at their fingertips and conducted several interesting experiments and subsequent data analysis which were published on their blog and subsequently in the book 'Cataclysm' by their lead data scientist Christian Rudder.\n\nI was curious to see how people interact when searching for love online when they are part of a (1) organized religion and (2) members of a minority. I teamed up with Shahzad Younus, founder of the muslim marriage app 'MuzMatch' to gather highly anonymized data about their users and extract insight into how people behave and what is important to them. For example, as an app targeted at members of a specific religious community, does levels of religiosity really matter? Does religion trump ethnicity?\n\nI hope to answer these questions and more.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
