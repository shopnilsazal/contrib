description: "\"Introduction to Nonparametric Bayesian Models\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - Anfiteatro 1]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nWhen we use supervised machine learning techniques we need to specify the number of parameters that our model will need to represent the data (number of clusters, number of Gaussians, etc.).\n\nSomewhat,  we are making our model inflexible.  In this talk we will study the nonparametric models, in specific, Bayesian Nonparametric Models (BNP) whose main purpose is getting more flexible models since that in BNP the parameters can be automatically inferred by the model.\n\nThe outline is the next:\n\nParametric vs Nonparametric models\nA review on probability distributions\nNon-parametric Bayesian Methods\nDirichlet Process\nPython (and R maybe) libraries for NPB\nConclusions\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
