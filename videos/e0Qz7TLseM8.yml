title: 'Reaktor Breakpoint 2018: Steven Spencer, Data engineering: the new old thing'
recordingDate: 1529052966
description: "Data Engineering suffers from an existential crisis. How does it fit into the modern environment amongst devops and software engineering and itâ€™s often confused with, more attractive cousin Data Science?\n\nSteven Spencer shares his past lives as a Software Engineer, hip startup coder and vitamin D challenged basement data-center dweller in an attempt to boil data engineering down to its core elements. In doing so, he discovers Data Engineering is hybrid of many disciplines, and at best a gateway drug to artificial intelligence.\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018. For more information, check reaktorbreakpoint.com. \n\n---\n\nSteven Spencer\nSoftware Engineer, Data Engineer, Reaktor\n\nSteven is a Lead Data Engineer at Reaktor with a focus on distributed systems and functional programming. Steven works on large-scale application and optimization of machine learning algorithms in the finance, games and telecommunications industries."
