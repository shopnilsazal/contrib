title: '#HITB2018AMS D1T1 - Fuzzing Javascript Engines for Fun and Pwnage - Areum Lee & Jeonghoon Shin'
recordingDate: 1524731612
description: "Web browser security is a hot and important research area. If a web browser is vulnerable, users can be affected by malware without their knowledge, or give the attacker control over their machines.\n\nIn this presentation, we will introduce methods to find vulnerabilities in Javascript Engines for web browsers via fuzzing.\n\nWe will talk about creating components for the fuzzer, and generating Javascript syntax efficiently. We will also reveal our own crash classification method and parallel fuzzing framework. In addition, we will share some tips for patternizing the results of 1-day case analysis for creating random javascript syntax and our custom pattern â€“ L.E.G.O.\n\nIf we find an exploitable 0day vulnerability before #HITB2018AMS, we will disclose that too ðŸ™‚\n\n=== \n\nAreum Lee is an undergraduate student in Sejong University, Seoul. She has been studying security for 4 years, and has previously worked as an intern at Fortinet HQ, Infosec team. She has started out with security consulting, but is not limited to it. Currently she is expanding her fields by trying out her capabilities in various aspects of security, and gaining more interest in research.\n\n--- \n\nSingi (Jeonghoon Shin) is currently working as a researcher in Theori, and as a Mentor of B.o.B Program (Koreaâ€™s next generation security leader education program). He has great interest in bug hunting in hardware and software."
