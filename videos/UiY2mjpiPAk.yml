description: "Performance analysis on financial software is massively complex and challenging. This is the story of how Murex started to use Splunk to help debug performance code issues.\n\nBefore Splunk we had millions and millions of timings logs, the problem was displaying them quickly so they are usable for developers and testers. Up to this point, we were using a basic PDF report with graphs with static mathematics. However, when we were able to dynamically graph this data with Splunk the analysis became much quicker and easier. The turnaround time decreased for resolution for testing and development. In addition to this we developed multiple functions in the dashboard to enhance the usability. A developer could attach their environment to Splunk in 20 seconds for live monitoring, they could save a test as a URL to share with colleagues.\n\nA success stories is one of the world’s largest “Clearing House” that needed to do 60 position updates per second. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJsTp7XlGGA [Dashboard for Developers+Testers 5 min] Murex/Robert Lynch won the “Splunk Ninja Revolution Award 2017” for the work done in this field.
