Once deployed, the standards-based nature of these networks make it easy for cash-strapped cities to use them for all manner of other IP-based services too.\n\nIn this presentation we examine a deployed and operational municipal mesh network designed by LeverageIS using Firetide hardware and Firetide's proprietary Firetide Mesh (formerly \"Automesh\") wireless mesh protocol. In the process, we decode the previously undocumented mesh protocol enough to (1) \"tune in\" to live feeds from the various cameras positioned across the city, just like we were in police headquarters, and (2) inject arbitrary video into these streams. There's a demo site for you to see the municipal camera streams for yourself, and our code is included. We'll cover wireless mesh networks and other basic theory, so no prior technical knowledge is required.\n\nDustin Hoffman is the president and senior engineer of Exigent Systems Inc., an IT services firm. Heâ€™s interesting in how all kinds of complex systems work and interact, whether technical, organizational, legal, or economic. It often involves otherwise public data used in non-obvious ways.\n\nThomas (TK) Kinsey is a senior engineer at Exigent Systems Inc. You'll find him breaking things and (usually) putting them back together. High School \"IT Guy\" - PC Retail slave - noob sysadmin - not so noob net/sysadmin - Now. Networks/VoIP are his current focus, some sort of BSD is usually involved."
