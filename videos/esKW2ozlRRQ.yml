description: "In the career of every passionate game developer, there is at least one moment where he or she wants for greatness. Beyond budgets and time, independent of our teams, we feel driven to create something great, to perfect our art form, not for profits, but for the pure pleasure of perfection. In this GDC 2014 talk, game design veteran Brenda Romero talks passionately about this subject.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
