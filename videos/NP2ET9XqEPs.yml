description: "Shared Values, Shared Responsibility\nGeneral Keith B. Alexander Commander, US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and Director, National Security AgenCy/Chief, Central Security Service (NSA/CSS)\n\nWe as a global society are extremely vulnerable and at risk for a catastrophic cyber event. Global society needs the best and brightest to help secure our most valued resources in cyberspace: our intellectual property, our critical infrastructure and our privacy. DEF CON has an important place in computer security. It taps into a broad range of talent and provides an unprecedented diversity of experiences and expertise to solve tough problems. The hacker community and USG cyber community share some core values: we both see the Internet as an immensely positive force; we both believe information increases in value by sharing; we both respect protection of privacy and civil liberties; we both believe in the need for oversight that fosters innovation, doesn't pick winners and losers, and retains freedom and flexibility; we both oppose malicious and criminal behavior. We should build on this common ground because we have a shared responsibility to secure cyberspace.\n\nGeneral Keith B. Alexander is the Commander, U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and Director, National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Service (NSA/CSS). As Commander, USCYBERCOM, he oversees planning, coordinating and conducting operations and defense of DoD computer networks.
