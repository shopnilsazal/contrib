language: English
recordingDate: 1400785966
description: "You don't have a bad memory, you were just never taught how to use it. We are going to practice several powerful memory techniques that have been perfected by memory contest champions over the last hundred years. By the end of this talk, you will know how to quickly memorize a foreign language, driving directions, phone conversations, the entire Chuck Norris filmography, your friend's credit card number, a shuffled deck of playing cards, and the name of every person you meet at RailsConf.\n\nChris Hunt works for GitHub from a standing desk in Portland, Oregon. Prior to GitHub, Chris worked on Rails applications for Square, Apple, Department of Defense, and his very critical mother. You can find him on Twitter as @chrishunt\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGZj/"
