recordingDate: 1266147594
description: "by Amanda Waite\r\n\r\nFaban 1.0 was released in November 2009, this lightning talk briefly looks at the features that Faban offers for developing benchmarks, infrastructure management services and load drivers and then will show what you need to do in order to write a driver from scratch. \r\n\r\nFaban is a tool for developing and running benchmarks. Faban supports multi-tier server benchmarks (such as web/cache/database benchmarks) run across dozens of machines. It also supports developing and running a simple micro-benchmark targeting a single component (such as an ftp server.) \r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nâ—¦http://faban.sunsource.net \r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
