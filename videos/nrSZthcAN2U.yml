description: "Tibor Arpas - Mashing up py.test, coverage.py and ast.py to take TDD to a new level\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nUsers and developers especially, hate waiting. Computing has adapted\nand we almost never wait for the computer for more then 10 seconds.\nOne big exception is runnig a test suite which takes MINUTES on many\nprojects. That is incredibly distracting, frustrating and dragging the\nwhole concept of automated tests down.\n\nI present a technique and a tool (py.test plugin called \"testmon\")\nwhich automatically selects only tests affected by recent changes.\nDoes it sound too good to be true? Python developers rightfully have a\nsuspecting attitude towards any tool which tries to be too clever\nabout their source code. Code completion and symbol searching doesn't\nneed to be 100% reliable but messing with the test suite execution? I\nshow that we can cut test suite execution time significantly but\nmaintain it's reliability."
