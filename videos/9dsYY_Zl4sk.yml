In the Internet era, does the adage hold true? Julian Assange might agree, but what about the unknown author of Stuxnet? Access to information is nice, but the audience must have electricity to download and display the data. In this presentation, Dr. Geers will compare and contrast the national security implications of Wikileaks -- the new pen, and Stuxnet -- the new sword.\r\n\r\nAbout Kenneth Geers\r\n\r\nKenneth Geers, PhD, CISSP, is the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) Cyber Subject Matter Expert. Mr. Geers was the first U.S. Representative to the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia. Mr Geers has served as an intelligence analyst, a French and Russian linguist, and computer programmer in support of arms control initiatives.\r\n\r\nHis new book, \"Strategic Cyber Security,\" is available as a free download from: http://ccdcoe.org/278.html"
