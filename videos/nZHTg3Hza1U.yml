description: 'When I became a parent, I was amazed at how similar raising a newborn was to becoming a developer and the ways in which both experiences affect one another. Coding sets you on a challenging path of a lifetime of learning… and in the end you still aren’t an expert! We will compare tradeoffs and decisions that relate to both situations offering insights and lessons learned. Then, explore the similarities between these two journeys and common approaches we use when coding and raising a baby. Whether you’re a parent or not, come discover these interesting and often hilarious parallels. Also, there might be a baby on stage.'
