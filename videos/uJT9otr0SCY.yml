description: "Autoscaling Containers... with Math - Allan Espinosa, Engine Yard, Inc.\n\n\"Docker and Kubernetes provides delightful APIs to show various statuses of our applications. From CPU, Load average, HTTP response times, etc. we all have what we need to make sure our app is running healthily.  When things are on fire, we Ops people twiddle some knobs like spin up more Pods to keep things going. We use mostly our experience and knowledge of the systems that we are running to know what to do.\n\nHowever, if you look at everyday things like your airconditioners and thermostats, they don't have an Ops team that gets paged to set the correct level of the coolant to set your room to the right temperature.  They use some math behind called *Control Theory* to keep your room's temperature stable.  In this talk, I will show how we can use the same concepts to autoscale and manage the health of our applications on Kubernetes.\"\n\nAbout Allan Espinosa\nAllan works at Engineyard where he supports customer's Deis, Docker and Kubernetes infrastructures in production. Prior to that he worked on managing one of the world's largest CloudFoundry deployments using Chef.\n\nAllan is also the author of \"Docker High Performance\" from Packt Publishing. The book contains some worked examples and high level concepts on how to get Docker up and running in production."
