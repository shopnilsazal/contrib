description: "BY: BRITTANY STOROZ\n\nNot long ago, the JavaScript world lacked a good Rails equivalent. Ember CLI is quickly filling this void, and consistently improving thanks to its extensibility. The tool can be easily tailored to build for custom environments by creating new add-ons and leveraging existing ones. \n\nThis presentation will highlight how to extend Ember CLI through add-ons, explaining example use-cases, how to create one, and the hooks available for developers to build into.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GO1U/"
