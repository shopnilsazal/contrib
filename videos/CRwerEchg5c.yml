description: "Description from DEF CON 9 Speaker’s Page: \n\nWe move from basic to more sophisticated attacks, cover a \"proof of concept\" case study and consider the counter measures possible. The session aims to serve as a starting point for all those interested in safe guarding their online existence, for those responsible for their organization’s security issues and for just about anyone who is interested in security.\n\nSharad Popli is the CTO and founding director of QuantumLink Communications Pvt. Ltd. (QLC), a five year old software company (based in Bombay, India), with a focus on Internet technologies and a specialization in Java.\n\nSharad, an old timer on the Net (more than 10 years now) is the chief architect behind PostMaster, a popular mail-server with more than 1500 installations across the world. A strong advocate of Open Source, he has been an early adopter of various open source technologies and software (including Linux since its 1.0 days and PHP when it was known as PHP/FI :))\nSharad writes from time to time (when persuaded enough!) His articles have appeared in most publications in India and also on CNETs international sites.\n\nHe is an oft-invited speaker at various seminars and conferences and has addressed numerous conventions on subjects including: Java Technologies, Servlets, Linux, Email, Security issues, MTAs on Linux, Advertising on the Net, and other generic net-based topics.\n\nWhen not ensnared by the Net, he enjoys reading, music and the great outdoors."
