description: "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#HITB2012KUL (OCT 10-11) REGISTRATION NOW OPEN\nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/ \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPresentation Materials: http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012ams/materials/ \n\nGlobal Fortune 1000 companies, large governmental organizations and defense entities have something in common -- they rely on SAP platforms to run their business-critical processes and information. Any cyber-criminal looking to perform espionage, sabotage or financial fraud attacks knows that these systems are keeping the business crown jewels.\n\nIn all SAP implementations there is a special system, which acts as the \"brain\" of the platform: the SAP Solution Manager. Using proprietary interfaces and protocols, the Solution Manager connects to and manages all the \"satellite\" SAP systems of an implementation (ERP, CRM, SCM, etc). Therefore, if an attacker compromises the SolMan, he would be able to expand his control to all the managed environments. In addition, due to architectural weaknesses, it would be possible for a malicious party to compromise a satellite system first and then use this as a pivot to the SolMan.\n\nThrough several live demos, this presentation presents novel attack vectors that a malicious hacker may use in his quest to break into the SAP Solution Manager, which would result in a total compromise of the SAP implementation. We will analyze the root causes of the technical vulnerabilities that enable these attacks and what you need to do in order to mitigate these threats in your organization.\n\nABOUT JUAN PEREZ-ETCHEGOYEN\n\nJuan Perez-Etchegoyen is the CTO of Onapsis, leading the Research and Development teams that keep the company in the cutting-edge of the ERP security field.

As a result of his research work and experience, Juan  has been invited to lecture and train in security conferences such as BlackHat, HITB Malaysia and Ekoparty, as well as to host private trainings on different aspects of information security for Global Fortune-100 organizations."
