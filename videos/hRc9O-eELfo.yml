recordingDate: 1529053581
description: "The amount of software today is huge, and we read the code more than we write it. We change it, we rewrite, and we refactor. So, we shouldn't focus on getting computer to understand the code, but instead getting our team to understand what we wanted. Stop writing code with no informational value, and make it better in communicating.\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018. For more information, check reaktorbreakpoint.com. \n\n---\n\nHeikki Ritola\nSoftware Developer, Reaktor\n\nHeikki has decades of experience developing software for digital businesses. With strong agile background, he believes in evolutionary improvement in business and software development. He loves teamwork and he is constantly seeking better working practices."
