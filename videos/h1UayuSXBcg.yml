description: "Your Company is \"Awesome\" (But is \"Company Culture\" a lie?) by Pamela Vickers\n\nWe all want to work for a company that cares about and promotes a balanced, fun, and, in a word, \"awesome\" culture, but unless you have safeguards in place against bad clients, bad projects, and bad apples, your company culture only exists on paper.\n\nWhat can we do as developers, team leaders, and mentors to protect ourselves and others from cultural failure? What are successful companies doing to maintain their workers' happiness? Is it ever okay to \"fire\" a bad client? What separates healthy internal pride and corporate propaganda?\n\nThis talk attempts to define the amorphous term while exploring the difficult task of owning your company culture and protecting it when things go wrong.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/F2yY/"
