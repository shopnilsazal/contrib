description: "Rethinking Web Development: noBackend & Offline First is a call to action for all developers to change their approach made by Jan Lehnardt at Web Rebels 2013\nWhen building anything, one needs to keep a few things in mind to ensure success. Two primary ones are:\n1. The target audience.\n2. Real-world constraints.\nThe current state of web development ignores these two at everyoneâ€™s peril.\nThis talk invites you to rethink modern web development a little bit, just enough to build a better technical foundation for everyone to use.\nWe will be looking at freeing frond-end developers from their shackles of backend technology and the offline-first approach to build better, more enjoyable, more functional and more mobile-friendly user experiences."
