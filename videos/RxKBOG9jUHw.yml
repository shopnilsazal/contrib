description: "Speaker : James Williams (Udacity)\n\nKotlin has been picking up steam as the preferred way to make Android apps bringing a wealth of features to Android development, including null safety, data classes with automatic property accessors/modifiers, first-class functions, and lambdas. Even with all those clear benefits, starting from scratch can be intimidating.\n\nIn this session, we'll convert a running Android app written in Java to Kotlin bit by bit."
