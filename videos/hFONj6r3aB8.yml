recordingDate: 1471248006
description: "Jason Fried\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/27/view_talk\nToday, services built on Python 3.5 using asyncio are widely used at Facebook. But as recently as May of 2014 it was actually impossible to use Python 3 at Facebook. Come learn how we cut the Gordian Knot of dependencies and social aversion to the point where new services are now being written in Python 3 and existing codebases have plans to move to Python 3.5.  All without official support or sanction.\r\n\r\n\"Rules for Radicals\" is a book for community organizers by the late Saul Alinsky on how to unite people to effect positive change in their communities."
