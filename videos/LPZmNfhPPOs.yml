description: "By Chuck Lauer Vose\n\nThere are not enough senior programmers in the world to satisfy the needs of our organizations; but educating your own developers is crazy expensive and hard, right?\n\nIt turns out there lots of effective, low-cost, low commitment ways to inject education into your organization, I'll show you some of the low commitment ways to engage your peers, how to evaluate your needs, how to measure your progress, and how to plan for future ed needs.\n\nChuck has been programming for the last 10 years, but recently switched full-time to a lifelong passion of teaching and education. Formerly he founded the Portland Code School, and now he's working with New Relic to build an incredible internal education program for incredible engineers.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1S/"
