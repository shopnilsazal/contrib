recordingDate: 1383782915
description: "Panel - Meet the EFF\nGet the latest information about how the law is racing to catch up with technological change from staffers at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the nation's premiere digital civil liberties group fighting for freedom and privacy in the computer age. This session will include updates on current EFF issues such as Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) use and misuse (and--maybe--the much delayed exemptions), whether breaking Captchas breaks the law, Digital Due Process (updating communications privacy law), legal and policy issues with walled gardens, and much more. Half the session will be given over to question-and-answer, so it's your chance to ask EFF questions about the law and technology issues that are important to you.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
