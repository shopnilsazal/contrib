description: "UDP in K8S: Signed, Sealed, but Delivered? [I] - Amanpreet Singh, Crowdfire\n\nThis talk is based on my personal experience working with Kubernetes in production. I will talk about the UDP failures we encountered in production, how we found out the root cause, how we mitigated and fixed the bug in kube-proxy. This will help the members of the audience who are - either planning to, or already using Kubernetes - to better understand the Kubernetes networking design and debug any issues they face.\n\nAbout Amanpreet Singh\nAmanpreet is an engineer at Crowdfire & moonlights as a crowd entertainer. Heâ€™s an Open Source enthusiast who loves Go & can eat-drink-sleep Kubernetes. He gained extensive knowledge of Kubernetes while handling the migration of infrastructure with 50+ microservices from traditional platforms to Kubernetes."
