SpinalHDL is analternative language which do his best to prove that is time to do a paradigmsshift in hardware description.\n\nSpinalHDL is a Scala library which allow to describe RTL by using objectoriented programming and functional programming. This presentation willpresent basics of SpinalHDL and then show by which way this alternativeapproach offer a huge benefit in the code clarity, genericity and reusability.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 10:00:00"
