description: "by Tom Callaway\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nTom Callaway, the Fedora Legal chair, will talk about the past, present, andfuture of licensing and legal issues in the Fedora community. Tom is not alawyer, nor does he play one on TV, but he does consult with lawyers, andoccasionally, go drinking with them. Bring your questions, and he'll do hisbest to answer them. I am not a lawyer, so nothing in my presentation shouldbe (or could be) construed as legal advice.\n\nFedora, as the evolution of Red Hat Linux, is one of the oldest and most wellknown Linux distributions in existence today. For more than 10 years, I havebeen the Fedora Legal representative who investigates licenses, negotiateswith lawyers, advises our community, and does everything in my power to nothave to tell people \"no\" without a very good reasoning.\n\nIn my presentation, I'll discuss the past, present, and future of licensingand legal issues in the Fedora community (and beyond). I'm also happy to takequestions from the FOSDEM audience as to why Fedora does what it does (ordoesn't do what it doesn't do).\n\nI am not a lawyer, so nothing in my presentation should be (or could be)construed as legal advice. I am however, a well informed hacker, and theeditor/maintainer of possibly the largest list of FOSS licenses in existence.\n\n\nRoom: H.1301 (Cornil)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 16:05:00"
