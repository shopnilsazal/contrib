recordingDate: 1442840820
description: "Luke Bakken\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/dotnetfringe/sdktry/\nIn May of 2014, Jeremiah Peschka and OJ Reeves announced their intent to pass stewardship of Corrugated Iron to new owners. Alex Moore and Luke Bakken of Basho Technologies immediately expressed interest in making the client code an official Basho product. Since the first of the year, they have worked full-time on ensuring that the code meets the needs of .NET developers using Riak. During this process, they gained valuable knowledge into the process of transferring stewardship and would like to present lessons learned on the following topics:\n\n  Copyright, licensing and attribution\n  Management of GitHub repositories\n  Transferring ownership\n  BFG large object pruning\n  Management of websites (corrugatediron.org) and other online resources\n  Continuous Integration - what we use and why[a][b]\n  NuGet\n  Source code changes\n  “clone it and build it”\n  Automate everything\n  StyleCop / FxCop\n  Backwards compatibility vs. supporting new .NET and Riak features\n  Documentation\n  Dedicated site vs GitHub wiki\n  Style and language changes"
