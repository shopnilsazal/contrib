description: "We recently open sourced Service Fabric, Microsoft's premiere distributed systems infrastructure and platform that powers a large swath of Azure itself. It's been an exciting week for the team and we are really happy to see the level of interest from the community. Thank you for your feedback and ideas! Please keep them coming.\n\nAs you learned on the team blog post, this is the first (big) step in our goal of moving entirely to an open development model across the entire product and engineering team... There is more to this open source thing than code. As always, the humans behind it all must also grow comfortable working in the new open development model.  We'd love your help!\n\nHere, we catch up with development lead Anmol Ahuja and program manager Vaclav Turecek, whom we call Vac (pronounced \"Voss\") to learn about the process of going from closed to open with such a large and complex code base (are there any larger Microsoft code bases on GitHub today?), the thinking behind going open source, the plans for the future, the meaning of it all.\n\nLinks: \n\nRepo: https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric\nBlog Post: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azureservicefabric/2018/03/14/service-fabric-is-going-open-source/"
