description: "By Jonan Scheffler and Aaron Patterson\nIt all started with a dream. A dream of a world where people have learned to live in harmony with nature, where war is a distant memory, where humankind reaches unimaginable heights of technological innovation and Magic: The Gathering players no longer need to sort their cards by hand. This presentation will describe in detail the life-changing technological leaps that led us to this collectible card game utopia, examining the scanning, recognition and sorting of small bits of cardboard and all the Ruby that allows the magic to happen. If you've ever dreamed of being able to live your planeswalking dreams without the requisite hours of collating your cardboard collection, this is the presentation for you.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1Z/"
