Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nCase study: How Containers Makes Security and Compliance Instantly Easier - John Morello, Twistlock (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nAs containers become the commonplace method for delivering and deploying applications, we've seen more of our customers taking a lift-and-shift approach to migrating their existing applications. In this session, John Morello at Twistlock will discuss a non-profit that provides environmental science and engineering oversight to some of the world's largest civil waterworks projects. This organization relies on a critical 14-year old app that models storm surge. The move to containers for this application delivered immediate benefits, making it easier to manage vulnerabilities, ensure regulatory compliance, and provide runtime defense. Throughout this session, we'll break down the security advantages of containers relative to traditional architectures using this real-life app as an example.\n\nAbout John\nJohn Morello is the Chief Technology Officer at Twistlock.
