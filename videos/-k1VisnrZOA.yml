recordingDate: 1266146129
description: "By Florian Schiessl\r\n\r\nThe talk gives a brief general view on the project's political and technical background in Germany's largest Municipality, shows the goals already achieved like the complete migration to OpenOffice.org and the city-wide use of the Open Document Format (ODF) and explains the steps for the next two years, the large-scale migration to the linux client. \r\n\r\nMunich's LiMux project aims at the use of free software and open standards on most of the 14,000 PCs of the Municipality's administration. Challenges are the integration of the Debian GNU/Linux client, the availability of (proprietary) business applications for this linux client and the migration to OpenOffice.org. \r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nâ—¦http://www.muenchen.de/limux \r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development.
