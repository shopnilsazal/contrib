description: "Byron Galbraith is the Chief Data Scientist and co-founder of Talla, where he works to translate the latest advancements in machine learning and natural language processing to build AI-powered conversational agents. Byron has a PhD in Cognitive and Neural Systems from Boston University and an MS in Bioinformatics from Marquette University. His research expertise includes brain-computer interfaces, neuromorphic robotics, spiking neural networks, high-performance computing, and natural language processing. Byron has also held several software engineering roles including back-end system engineer, full stack web developer, office automation consultant, and game engine developer at companies ranging in size from a two-person startup to a multi-national enterprise.\n\nAbstract summary\n\nNeural Information Retrieval and Conversational Question Answering:\nOne the main affordances of conversational UIs is the ability to use natural language to succinctly convey to a bot what you want. An area where this interface excels is in question answering (Q&A). Research into Q&A systems often falls at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR), and while NLP has been getting a lot of attention from deep learning for several years now, itâ€™s only largely within the last year or so that the field of IR has seen an equivalent explosion of interest in employing these techniques. In this presentation, I will touch on challenges facing conversational bots, provide a high level overview into the emerging field of Neural Information Retrieval, discuss how these methods can be used in a Q&A context, and then highlight some lessons learned attempting to design and deploy a conversational Q&A agent-based product."
