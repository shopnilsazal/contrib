description: "How You Can Fix Your Community in One Day  by Anika Lindtner\n\nThis talk will teach you a magic trick. It will show you to stop our communities from breaking apart. Studies have shown that half the women who enter the technology field will leave over time. HALF! Whatâ€™s happening? How did we get here? What can we do? In my talk I will show you how we can fix the diversity problem, and why we should care. I'll tell you a true story about about role models, Rails Girls Summer of Code, broken stereotypes - and cat gifs. How to build community-driven initiatives that change our world. And the best part is: Everyone can do it. In one day.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GvoW/"
