description: 'The talk will focus on less than one day length events that any Rubyists can organize in their locality to nurture and grow a vibrant ruby community. Specifically, the talk will explore in detail two such events - Code Retreat & Rails Bugmash, and will be based on my experience in organizing Code Retreats in Boulder (Feb 2011) & Fort Collins (June 2011), and Rails Bugmashes in Boulder and Bangalore (both in May 2011).'
