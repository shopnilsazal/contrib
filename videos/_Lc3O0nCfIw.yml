description: 'Denial of service. It requires a low level of resources and knowledge, it is very easy to deploy, it is very common and it is remarkable how effective it is overall. PEIMA is a brand new method of client side malicious activity detection based on mathematical laws, usually used in finance, text retrieval and social media analysis, that is fast, accurate, and capable of determining when denial of service attacks start and stop without flagging legitimate heavy interest in your server erroneously. However, denial of service attacks aren''t the only type of anomalous activity you can look at with PEIMA. Learn what kinds of unusual identifying metrics you can get out of your network and users to help detect intrusions and, ultimately, defend your assets.'
