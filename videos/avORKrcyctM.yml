description: "Running Multiple Schedulers in Kubernetes - Xiaoning Ding, Huawei\n\nIn this session we will talk about the mechanism of supporting multi schedulers in a Kubernetes cluster. First we will give an overview of multi-scheduler frameworks in various cluster management systems, including its evolution, the pros and cons of each different architecture. Then we will talk about how multi schedulers are currently supported in Kubernetes. We will also introduce a new multi-scheduler framework designed by Huawei PaaS team, which is inspired by the Omega paper but with lots of improvements. The framework is based on the general idea of optimistic concurrent control and global shared state. It includes lots of enhanced features like multi-level conflict criteria, various state synchronization mechanisms, priority-based conflict resolution, batch commit, policy management, etc.\n\nAbout Xiaoning Ding\nXiaoning Ding is an architect in Huawei PaaS cloud computing team based in Seattle.
