recordingDate: 1417093396
description: "You are a developer with exciting ideas to launch online, and you want to be all set for success from the start? This session will introduce the Google Cloud Platform key components by replaying the past 5 years at SnapEngage on the Cloud Platform, adding components of the platform one by one to grow from an idea, to a feature and finally to a software as a service serving billions of queries every month. We will cover Google AppEngine, Google CloudStorage, Google BigQuery, Google Compute Engine and also mention some interesting non-Google developer products which complement the Cloud Platform.\n\nPrésentation par Jérôme Mouton"
