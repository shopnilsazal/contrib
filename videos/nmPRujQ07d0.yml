description: "Viki Navratilova - Today's Modern Network Killing Robot\nToday's Modern Network Killing Robot\n\nToday's Modern Network Killing Robot will give an overview on the new generation of DDOS tools. Back in the day, a couple of large pings could take down lots of machines. When those techniques stopped being effective means of taking down networks, people started writing DDOS programs. These programs required a little bit of manual work to install, but were effective at taking down large networks for a while. This generation of DDOS tools were made famous in the media by DDOS'ing famous websites for hours at a time. Soon people learned to control the damage done by these tools, and so a new generation of DDOS tools were born: Ones that could infect thousands of machines automatically to create large botnets, and hide their communications in order to evade detection better than their predecessors.\n\nThese botnets are now the most effective DDOS tools in popular use today. This talk will go over the more popular botnets, such as gtbot and sdbot, and talk about how they work and some ways to spot them on your network.\n\nThere will be a demonstration of an irc botnet in action.\n\nViki Navratilova lost on Hacker Jeopardy when she wouldn't agree that WEP is secure. After getting her B.S. in C.S., she's bounced around various corporations in the Chicago area doing computer security, 5ESS, and Unix admin stuff. She has collected clothing with company logos from all of them. Her writings on Linux and computer security have been published in web page, magazine, newspaper, and book form.\n\nIn 2001 Viki got the Chicago Tribune to publish a map of all the open wireless networks in downtown Chicago on the front page of the Business section to go along with her article on widespread unsecured wireless networks.\n\nViki likes pizza and beer."
