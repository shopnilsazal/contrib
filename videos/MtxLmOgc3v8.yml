title: 'Panel: Whither Security in a Cloud-Native World?'
recordingDate: 1473199813
description: "Moderated by Christopher Lijenstople, Tigera\n\nPanelist:\nMichael Ansel, Box\nJoseph Jacks, Apprenda\n\n\nTraditionally, the security team has been the \"immovable object\" within any enterprise: any new project must be meet a rigid set of security rules in order to proceed. Into that established world order, an \"irresistible force\" is emerging with increasing momentum: the cloud-native approach redefines how applications are architected, throwing many traditional assumptions out of the window. The two are on collision course. What will be the fall-out? This panel will discuss what the world looks like after that collision: How will applications be secured? Who will define security policies? And how will they be enforced across hybrid environments - both private and public clouds, and traditional bare metal / VM and cloud-native, containerized workloads?"
