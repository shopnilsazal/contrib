description: "Gadi Evron & Panel: Internet Wars 2007\nGadi Evron Moderator\nAndrew Fried IRS\nThomas Grasso FBI\nDan Hubbard Websense\nDan Kaminsky IOActive\nRandy Vaughn Baylor\nPaul Vixie ISC\n\nContinuing our new tradition from last year, leading experts from different industries, academia and law enforcement will go on stage and participate in this panel, discussing the current threats on and to the Internet, from regular cyber-crime all the way to the mafia, and even some information warfare.\n\nIn this panel session we will begin with a short introductory presentation from Gadi Evron on the latest technologies and operations by the Bad Guys and the Good Guys. What's going on with Internet operations, global routing, botnets, extortion, phishing and the annual revenue the mafia is getting from it. The members will accept questions on any subject related to the topic at hand, and discuss it openly in regard to what's being done and what we can expect in the future, both from the Bad Guys and the Good Guys.\n\nDiscussion is to be limited to issues happening on the Internet, rather than this or that vulnerability. The discussion is mostly technological and operational in nature, although last year attendees chose to ask questions directing the discussion to the legal side of things. Participants are people who are involved with battling cyber-crime daily, and are some of the leaders in the security operations community of the Internet."
