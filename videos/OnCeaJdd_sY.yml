The vast majority of your time is spent trying to understand code that is already written. Either code of others, or code that you yourself wrote a last year.\n\nItâ€™s especially tricky to get into a completely new codebase. You might when you start a new job or perhaps your team takes ownership of a new system.\n\nI have done this a couple of times now, and I have a process for it now, and I figure that it might be interesting to some people to hear about it, and that is what we are going to explore today."
