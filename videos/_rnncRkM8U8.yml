description: "A juicy, melt in your mouth brisket. A beautifully orchestrated application. These don't just happen. They take experience, which is evolutionary. I have a technique for smoking a brisket, born out of iteration and experimentation, that makes a pretty good brisket. Software development and cooking have a lot in common. I'll tell you about my brisket, but really I'll talk about learning to process information quicker and more efficiently. This not only gives answers a place to land, but tastes good too.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HBVs/"
