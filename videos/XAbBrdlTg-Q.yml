description: "http://visualizingdisparity.com is more than a capstone project. It is a visualization tool that showcases disparity between racial and economic majority and minority groups in the US.\nCompleted during my final month of in-class learning at Ada Developers Academy, this project uses D3's vivid and interactive map projection, and charts, to explore the living conditions of the underserved and underrepresented in our country.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss the key features of the Visualizing Disparity project and highlight the different technologies used to create it. I will also cover the challenges and successes that I faced as a budding Software Engineer.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HG4B/"
