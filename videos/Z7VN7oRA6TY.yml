description: "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nDeep learning grows in popularity and use, but it has two problems. Neural networks have millions of parameters and provide no uncertainty. In this talk, we solve both problems with one simple trick: Bayesian deep learning. We show how to prune 90% of the parameters while maintaining performance. As a bonus, we get the uncertainty over our predictions, which is useful for critical applications.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/RobRomijnders/weight_uncertainty/blob/master/docs/presentation/versions/final_pydata18_bayes_nn_rob_romijnders_1.pdf\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
