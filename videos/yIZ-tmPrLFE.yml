description: "Kubernetes Cluster Federation: How to Write a Federated Controller? [A] - Madhu C.S. & Nikhil Jindal, Google\n\nExtensibility is one of the major selling points of Kubernetes. Cluster Federation is built on the same spirit, but the tooling provided in the form of libraries and framework to build federated controllers is quite different than the tooling provided to build Kubernetes controllers. In this talk, we will show you the tools and techniques provided by Cluster Federation to write your own federated controllers. We will also show you the steps involved in building a federated controller by building one during the talk.\n\nAbout Madhu C.S.\nMadhu C.S. (madhusudancs@{github, slack, twitter}) is a Software Engineer on the Kubernetes team at Google where he works on Cluster Federation. Before Kubernetes, he worked on a number of different projects within Google Cloud. He also has a strong background in compilers and has worked on a JIT-compiler project at Google. Before joining Google full-time, Madhu helped the Google Summer of Code team for five years as an open source contributor. He is a long time open source contributor, a Gopher and a Pythonista.\n\nAbout Nikhil Jindal\nNikhil Jindal (nikhiljindal@github) is a Software Engineer on the kubernetes team at Google. He had started by working on API machinery and is now focussed on Cluster federation. Before getting the kubernetes bug, he was enjoying working on Google Maps."
