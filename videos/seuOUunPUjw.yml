title: 'Debugger: for Developers - Denys Mishunov | DeltaV 2018'
language: English
recordingDate: 1528734430
description: "What’s common for Meryl Streep, Henry Ford and Albert Einstein? All of them suffered from different problems in their professional lives despite their success. This talk *is not about development*. Instead of code, this inspirational and motivational talk will set debugger on ourselves as humans to analyse the bugs most of us face in our day-to-day jobs as developers. Among others, we will be talking about:\n\nPerfectionism\nImposter syndrome\nOverwork\nBut these are not limited to developers and are applicable to a much wider audience. It will be about psychology, neuroscience, work-life balance, work quality and… us."
