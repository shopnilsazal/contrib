recordingDate: 1368376043
description: "KEYNOTE MATERIALS:\nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2013ams/materials/ \n\nKEYNOTE ABSTRACT: \n\nOrganized criminals, nation-state groups and hacktivists continue to wreak havoc within organizations of all sizes in spite of their security teams' best efforts. Are security teams just not getting it? No -- it's just that security teams today must face unknown and unexpected attacks when there is a legacy over-reliance on antiquated incident management processes, an over-dependence on obsolete technology and a failure to use intelligence-driven detection approaches.\n\nThis keynote covers why it's important for security people to understand the relationship between baseball and advanced attacks and also discusses how big data approaches can reduce uncertainty to succeed against advanced adversaries by transforming four critical aspects of any security program.\n\nABOUT EDDIE SCHWARTZ\n\nMr. Schwartz is Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for RSA and has 25 years experience in the information security field. Previously, he was Co-Founder and CSO of NetWitness (acquired by EMC), CTO of ManTech, EVP and General Manager of Global Integrity (acquired by INS), SVP of Operations of Guardent (acquired by VeriSign), CISO of Nationwide Insurance, a Senior Computer Scientist at CSC, and a Foreign Service Officer with the U.S. Dept. of State.
