description: "RubyConf 2016 - How I Taught My Dog To Text Selfies by Greg Baugues\n\nThis talk is for the Rubyist who wants to get into hardware hacking but feels intimidated or unsure of where to start. The Arduino Yun is wifi-enabled and runs a stripped-down version of Linux. That means that you can build hardware hacks that execute Ruby scripts and interact with web APIs. In this talk, we'll start from scratch and live code a hardware hack that my dog uses to text me selfies using a webcam, Twilio, and a big red button."
