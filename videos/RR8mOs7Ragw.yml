recordingDate: 1353927531
description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/materials/ \n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT: \n\nIn this lecture, Don A. Bailey will take a look back at another great milestone in information security: the movie Hackers. In this retrospective, Don will analyze every \"hack\" implemented in the cult classic and demonstrate how in modern day these attacks are even more relevant, realistic, and cost effective. Don will discuss the exact technologies used in modern day versions of these exploits and what tactical requirements are no longer glass ceilings for attackers. Mr. Bailey will also provide demonstrations that show low cost and creative ways to bypass physical security controls. Using simple, modern, and sometimes even even rudimentary technology, demonstrations will show that no matter how complex a security control may be there is always a fast and effective bypass. Oh, and by the way... Hack the Planet.\n\nABOUT DON BAILEY\n\nDon A. Bailey is an internationally respected security researcher known for breaking ground in the mobile and embedded security spaces.
