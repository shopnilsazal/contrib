description: "By, Tom Stuart\nAbstraction is a tool that magnifies the force of the human mind. The use of abstraction to make complex ideas manageable is fundamental to our work as programmers and to human culture as a whole. That's why mathematics — the study of abstraction — is so important and powerful.\nThis is a talk about abstraction: where it comes from, what it's for, and how we can use it to make our programs better.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GZe6/"
