description: "Hands are the most basic tools for people to use to interact with their surroundings, yet, hands are constantly avoided in games and Virtual Reality. While different input hardware for hands are flooding the VR market, the output, what you actually see, is still at a crude state. This 2016 VRDC talk from Gleechi's Jakob Johansson and Kai Hbner draws on 8 years of robotics experience to explain problems related to generating natural hand motion and interaction, and the issues this creates for virtual reality and how to work with the large amount of different hand input on the market.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
