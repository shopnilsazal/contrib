description: "Scott Moulton: Re-Animating Drives - Advanced Data Recovery\n\nNEW!! Advanced Data Recovery Material. Even people who think they know everything about a hard drive will be surprised at what they will learn in this presentation. Everyone will learn something new about hard drives and how to perform data recovery. We will lay it on the line and tell all! We will display All NEW Material and Animations on the inner workings of a hard drive. We will discuss rebuilding a hard drive and will teach you what to look for and how to accomplish this task on your own. If nothing else you will be entertained by one of the best animations on hard drives in the style of the History Channel.\n\n\"Scott Moulton is a forensic specialist and runs a data recovery company out of Atlanta called My Hard Drive Died where he uses his forensics experience to recover hard drives."
