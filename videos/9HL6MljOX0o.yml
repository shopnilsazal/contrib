Oh binary, where art thine vulns?\n\nSymbolic analysis has been a \"thing\" for 20 years, and yet it's still left largely to the obscure and the academic researchers (and NASA). several years ago, Invisigoth incorporated the Symboliks subsystem into the Vivisect binary analysis framework. due to that inclusion, the very nature of binary analysis has been broken down, rethought, and arisen out of the ashes. this talk will give an introduction into Symboliks, Graph Theory, and the path forward for reverse engineering and vulnerability research, all from an interactive Python session or scripts.\n\nA four time winner of DEF CON capture the flag and retired captain of the team \"1@stplace\", over the past decade atlas has proved expertise in programmatic reverse-engineering, automated vulnerability discovery and exploitation, and braking into or out of nearly every type of computer system/subsystem. areas of specialty include exmpedded/IoT exploitation, power systems and industrial control systems exploitation, automotive exploitation, and client/server/application exploitation.\n\nTwitter: @at1as"
