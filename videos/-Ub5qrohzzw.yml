description: "Vidéo tournée dans le cadre de #BlendWebMix 2015.\n\nLessons I've learned about design, business, and being paid to drink craft beer\nConférencier : Elliot Jay Stocks\n\nDesigner Elliot Jay Stocks looks back over his career so far, starting with some truly embarrassing Flash sites, through to life as a freelancer, the creation of typography magazine 8 Faces, his work as the Creative Director of Adobe Typekit, and his most recent venture: the lifestyle magazine Lagom. He looks at lessons learned along the way, and focuses on that sometimes difficult intersection between design and business — as well as a healthy dose of typsetting geekery."
