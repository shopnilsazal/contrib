description: "Sarah Gordon - Viruses on (and off) the Internet. Panel Session.\n\nComputer viruses are currently freely available on the Internet, as well as via various mailing lists. The recent Melissa virus incident has focused attention on some issues surrounding the public availability of viruses. The panel (representing virus writers, antivirus product developers, open source advocates and academics) will represent a wide range of views on topics such as: \"Is it cool to make viruses available via the Internet? Is posting of viral source code to mailing lists as a 'necessary evil' which can force developers to improve products. Should virus writing itself be illegal?\". We want to hear *your* views, too, so the session will end with Q&A Interactive.\n\nSarah Gordon graduated from Indiana University with special projects in both UNIX system security and ethical issues in technology. She currently works with the anti-virus science and technology R&D team at IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. Her current research projects include development of antivirus product certification standards, test criteria, and testing models. She has been featured in publications such as Forbes, IEEE Monitor, The Wall Street Journal, and WIRED, and is published regularly in publications such as Computers & Security, Network Security Advisor and Virus Bulletin. She has won several awards for her work in various aspects of computing technology, and volunteers in an advisory capacity to Virus Bulletin, The WildList Organization, and The European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research. \n\nDEF CON 7.0 was held July 9-11th, 1999, in Las Vegas Nevada USA"
