description: "You can do many things with a quadcopter. We, as fanatic real-time strategy gamers, wanted our drone to listen to our commands given at the map level, revealing the terrain below it as it flies and creating a coherent and smooth map.\n\nHovewer funny and amusing, this will be a presentation about serious, high-level technology, unpredictable ideas and insistent scientific struggle to make all the algorithmic meat work on a flying machine.\n\nDuring this presentation we will tell you how we created our first successful prototype, we will show the demonstration videos and will explain our technology based on video processing, accelerometer data control and localization using particle filtering algorithm.\n\nIf you are planning to remotely prepare the map of the Moon (or your living room), you cannot miss this presentation."
