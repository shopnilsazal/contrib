description: "RailsConf 2018: Don't Settle for Poor Names (or for Poor Design) by Alistair McKinnell\n\nHave you ever been frustrated with code that is sprinkled with poorly named classes, methods, and variables?\n\nOne of the most valuable things you can do as a developer is to choose good names and to sensitize your teammates to the benefits of improving names.\n\nIt turns out that improving names is deeply connected to improving design. And vice-versa. You will see and experience this deep connection as we explore a real world example.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you will have learned a process to get you started with improving names and improving designâ€”a process simple enough for you to teach others."
