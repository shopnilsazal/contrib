language: English
recordingDate: 1521494994
description: "Abstract: \nWelcome to 2018. Although there’s no flying car in every garage yet. We do have malicious code capable of crashing governments and markets easily available by Google. A world where data seems leaked more often than secured. New laws and fines appear an opportunity to reverse the current, rather depressing trend of our private data seemingly spilled everywhere, breach after breach. Leaked data, compromised and vulnerable systems have become a new type of currency in the underground cyber crime economy. Some economically sanctioned countries, seeing high returns possible from digital crime, have invested heavily. The European Union’s new data protection regulations, EU GDPR, come into force in May 2018 with wide ranging implications and worldwide income fining teeth. Unfortunately, with progress comes new cyber crime opportunities, for some regimes with nuclear weapons. Learn key points and the effect the EU GDPR can have on your organization. Serious pitfalls, loopholes and take aways. Unravel the way some sanctioned countries actively utilize breaches ad digital crime to fund “interesting” regimes and a new type of cyber crime built on privacy.\n\nby Christina Kubecka, CEO of HypaSec\n\nChris Kubecka, Security Researcher and CEO of HypaSec.
