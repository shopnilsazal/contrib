title: 'DEF CON 13 - Fyodor, Hacking Nmap'
recordingDate: 1391815218
description: "Fyodor, Hacking Nmap\n\nWhile many security practitioners use Nmap, few understand its full power. Nmap deserves part of the blame for being too helpful. A simple command such as \"nmap scanme.insecure.org\" leaves Nmap to choose the scan type, timing details, target ports, output format, source ports and addresses, and more. You can even specify -iR (random input) and let Nmap choose the targets! Hiding all of these details makes Nmap easy to use, but also easy to grow complacent with. Many people never explore the literally hundreds of available options and scan techniques for more powerful scanning.\n\nIn this presentation, Nmap author Fyodor details advanced Nmap usage-from clever hacks for teaching Nmap new tricks, to new and undocumented features for bypassing firewalls, optimizing scan performance, defeating intrusion detection systems, and more.\n\nFyodor authored the popular Nmap Security Scanner, which was named security tool of the year by Linux Journal, Info World, and the Codetalker Digest. It was also featured in the hit movie \"Matrix Reloaded\" as well as by the BBC, CNet, Wired, Slashdot, Securityfocus, and others. He also maintains the Insecure.Org and seclists.org security resource sites and has authored seminal papers detailing techniques for stealth port scanning, remote operating system detection via TCP/IP stack fingerprinting version detection, and the IPID Idle Scan. He is a member of the Honeynet project and a co-author of the books Know Your Enemy: Honeynets and Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent."
