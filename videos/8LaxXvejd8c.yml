description: "Danny O'Brien: Digital Rights Worldwide: Or How to Build a Global Hacker Conspiracy\nHackers and tech users in the United States have long benefited from some long-lived institutions that have worked to helped defend and publicise their rights, including but not limited to EFF and DefCon itself. But the legal and political fights over DRM and copyright, privacy invasions, cybercrime round-ups and security scaremongering, are now increasingly international battles. How can hackers across the world build their own institutions, and co-ordinate between them. Headed by Danny O'Brien, EFF's International Outreach Coordinator, co-founder of the UK's Open Rights Group, and inventor of \"Life Hacks\", this talk will pool advice from activist hackers coming to DefCon from around the world.\n\nDanny O'Brien is the International Outreach Coordinator for the EFF. He works to help us collaborate with organizations and individuals fighting for liberties across the world. Danny has documented and fought for digital rights in the UK for over a decade, where he also assisted in building tools of open democracy like Fax Your MP. He co-edits the award-winning NTK newsletter, has written and presented science and travel shows for the BBC, performed a solo show about the Net in the London's West End, and once successfully lobbied a cockney London pub to join Richard M. Stallman in a spontaneous demonstration of Bulgarian folk dance."
