description: "by Guiseppe Maxia\r\nâ—¦NOTE: THIS IS NOT A TALK ABOUT MYSQL - IT'S ABOUT GENERAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS NEW TECHNOLOGIES - I have presented this talk at two open source events where it was received enthusiastically *** \r\nIf you don't know them, they will hurt you. No matter how expert you are, there are holes in your knowledge, and when things go wrong you usually blame what you know the least. So the culprit could be that database, the regular expression engine, the XML parser, the thread engine. What if the problem is between the chair and the keyboard instead? This talk will give you some general insight on the art of software development, encouraging users to rant less and improve their own practice. \r\nThe most popular open source database in the world * NOTE that this talk is not about MySQL * \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
