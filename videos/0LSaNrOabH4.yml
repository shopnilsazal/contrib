description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nSPIFFE Project Intro - Andrew Jessup & Emiliano Berenbaum, Scytale, Inc. (Any Skill Level)\n\nJoin SPIFFE and SPIRE contributors for an overview of the newest project to join the CNCF. Modern software development relies on many microservices working together, that in production may be distributed over different middleware systems, container schedulers, PaaS platforms and even different cloud providers. As production environments become more complex, and dynamic - establishing trust between microservices is becomes more difficult, creating challenges for developers, operations teams, and security teams alike. Enter SPIFFE (Secure Production Infrastructure for Everyone) and which builds on designs first championed at Google, Twitter and elsewhere to provide robust authentication and trust between disparate micro-services. SPIFFE and SPIRE make it trivial to establish trust between workloads that may be elastically scaled and dynamically scheduled, and deployed in deeply heterogenous environments. We'll walk through the design goals for SPIFFE (a specification) and SPIRE (a multi-cloud implementation of SPIFFE), an overview of SPIRE's modular architecture, and an overview of how it can be used in conjunction with other tools such as secret stores and service meshes to build secure and scalable microservice architectures.\n\nAbout Andrew\nAndrew is the co-founder of Scytale, who are helping bring SPIFFE into the world. Find out more at https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe Andrew is an engineer, and entrepreneur with a passion for building tools that help bring simplicity to software development. Prior to co-founding Scytale, Andrew was a product manager on Googleâ€™s Cloud Platform, launching many of the automation primitives on Google Compute Engine (including Auto-scaling, Managed Instance Groups, and Deployment Manager), helping improve developer workflow with the Spinnaker and Container Builder projects, and helping improve accessibility to developers and operations teams. As an Australian in the San Francisco Bay Area, Andrew spends most of his spare time trying to sell his Midwestern wife on the virtues of Vegemite.\n\nAbout Emiliano\nEmiliano is the CTO at Scytale, Inc."
