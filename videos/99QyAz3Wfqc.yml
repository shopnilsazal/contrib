description: "React Native ships its own development server and bundler, which is both externally and internally used at Facebook. Making this process scalable and reliable is a hard process when you have a large codebase. We will be presenting and explaining its architecture, as well as the ideas behind it in order to make it fast; and we will roughly introduce the different output formats it is able to provide for maximum performance both on development and on iOS and Android production environments.\n\nOMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
