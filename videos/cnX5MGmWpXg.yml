description: "The teaching of programming concepts has come a long way in terms of tools and pedagogies but the underlying concepts appear timeless. In this session we will look at the place of programming in schools in the junior school through National Curriculum imperatives like Digital Technologies and the Information Processing and Technology perspectives and how Python can have a place here.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nJuly 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
