description: "https://www.cncf.io/event/webinar-cloudnativestrategy\n\nAbstract\n\nMany companies see the benefits of highly available, scalable and resilient systems. They want to go ‘cloud native’ but as they reach for containerised microservices they may actually be grabbing the golden egg rather than the goose that laid it.\n\nIn this webinar we’ll look at a model for emerging strategy, classic mistakes and how to avoid them. We’ll also look at how we can iterate through the ‘cloud native’ problem space. Along the way, and before we get to recent history, we’ll visit ancient Greece, post-war Scandinavia, and the Jet Propulsion Lab. We’ll learn about heuristics, including the doughnut principle, and then of course we’ll confront the key paradox that strategy tries to resolve: what is good for a business is not necessary good for those who work in it.\n\nBio\n\nJamie is the CEO of Container Solutions, one of the world’s leading cloud native consultancies. He specializes in strategy and works with companies who have particularly difficult problems to solve."
