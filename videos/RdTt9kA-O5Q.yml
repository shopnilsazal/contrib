title: 'Rails Conf 2013 Testing Complex Systems: Creating data and limiting scope by Noel Rappin'
recordingDate: 1369339811
description: "In this workshop, we'll focus on two specific problems that plague testing complex systems: how do I create useful test data, and how do I limit my test to only the part of the system that I want tested. We'll cover data creation tools like factories and fixtures. We will also talk about how to effectively use mock objects. And we'll do all that against some code that shows off potental testing problems.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGaC/"
