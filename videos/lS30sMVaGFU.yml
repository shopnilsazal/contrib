They save countless lives and ensure a better quality of life for many. Although medical devices are key to quality care and undergo rigorous testing, many are not sufficiently tested for adversarial resiliency. Some question whether our dependence on these life-saving medical devices has grown more quickly than our ability to secure them.There is no question that medical devices save countless lives, but is insecure design or deployment of these devices putting patients at risk? Join us for an in-depth presentation on a three year research project that shows numerous medical devices and healthcare organizations are vulnerable to direct attack vectors that can impact patient safety and human life.\n\nBio\n\nScott Erven is a healthcare security visionary with more than 15 years’ experience in information technology and security.
