description: "by Pierre Ficheux\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nYocto/OpenEmbedded is a very famous build system for embedded Linux andaccording to the last \"IoT developper survey\", it's the the most used OS forIoT devices. During the conference, we will describe some advanced Yocto/OEfeatures in order to build a simple sensor based on Raspberry Pi zero.\n\nBuilding a sensor with Yocto could be quite simple. During the conference wewill explain hown to integrate an I²C sensor with Raspberry Pi zero.\n\n  * setting up Wi-Fi connection  * writing recipe for I²C temperature/pressure device control  * adding a Linux service to get data from sensor through I²C bus  * adding NTP client with Yocto package management (SMART)  * building a dedicated distro for the device  * adding everything to a new layer (meta-iot)\n\n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 13:30:00"
