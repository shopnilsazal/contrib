description: "by Maciej Sumi≈Ñski\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nLet's be sincere, all of us would love to change something in KiCad. I bet youhave an idea for a new tool or another killer feature that would make yourlife so much easier.\n\nYou know what? You are free to do so! Even more, you are welcome to contributeto the project, and it is not that difficult as one may think. Those who havebrowsed the source code might find it overwhelming at first, but the truth is:you do not have to know everything to create useful extensions.\n\nI would like to invite you for a walk through the KiCad source code todemonstrate how easy it is to add this tool you have always been dreamingabout.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 14:00:00"
