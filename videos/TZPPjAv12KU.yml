It will cover the latest trends and use-cases of the serverless movement, as well as the effort happening within the CNCF to converge on a common format for event data. We'll discuss and demonstrate how that facilitates serverless computing across cloud providers and on premises, enables new types of applications and empowers developers.\n\n\"About Austen\nAusten Collins is a product-obsessed, software engineering leader. His focus is not on technology, but on business value, customer experience and making meaning. Austen is a primary influencer of the emerging “serverless” movement. He is the creator of the Serverless Framework, the leading open-source tool for building applications with the least possible cost and overhead on top of infrastructure with “serverless” qualities.
