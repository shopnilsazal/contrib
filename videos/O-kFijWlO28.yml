description: "\"Python Bee\n[EuroPython 2017 - Interactive session - 2017-07-14 - PythonAnywhere Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nThought up in 2009 by a group of MIT students who entered the Python bee into a competition for “bad ideas”, a Python bee is like a spelling bee for programmers. \n\nInstead of spelling words, participants are given functions to write and must spell them out loud - one character at a time, without looking at the code that they're writing! Players must spell valid Python and every character counts, including symbols and whitespace. \n\nAnd the twist for the second round (credit for this one goes to dropboxblogs):\n\nYou're now allowed to look at the code, but... you must now team up with other programmers, entering alternate characters without being allowed to communicate via any other means.\n\nIn order for everyone to be able to have a go, we'll split up into small groups to play - for those that want to be competitive, we'll use a scoring system so that we can still declare an overall champion. You're very welcome to come along just to have fun though!\n\nTL;DR - a fun hour of slightly ridiculous programming games :)\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
