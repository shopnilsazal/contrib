title: 'Rails Conf 2013 From Rails to the Web Server to the Browser by David Padilla'
recordingDate: 1369190180
description: "Most of us know how to build beautiful web applications with Rails. With the help of templating tools like ERB and HAML our web apps create HTML documents, but, do you know exactly how those HTML documents end up in a browser?\nDuring this talk I will show you the bits that make it all happen. We will dissect the relevant code within Rails, Rack and the thin web server to discover exactly how the web server starts and listens to a TCP port, communicates with Rails and returns the HTML document that your browser parses.\nWhy? Because we're curious about it, that's why.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGa7/"
