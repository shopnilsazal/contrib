description: "JP Dunning - Breaking Bluetooth by Being Bored\nBluetooth has come leaps and bounds in its past decade of use. Finding its way into billions of devices world wide. This talk introduces several new Bluetooth attack tools and projects focusing on automated pen-testing, obfuscation, Bluetooth profile cloning, war-nibbling, Denial of Service, and mapping Bluetooth device information. We will be discussing what information your Bluetooth devices gives out about you and what you can do about it, a method for more accurate discovery of Bluetooth devices in non-discoverable mode, how to automate your Bluetooth pen-testing, as well as a few exploits over Bluetooth file transfer.\n\nJP Dunning is currently a Graduate Student in Computer Science at Virginia Tech.
