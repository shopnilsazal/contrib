recordingDate: 1449251030
description: "PyData NYC 2015\n\nThe internet of things has provided great opportunities to put time-series sensor data to good use. At Columbia University, we've collected wireless router data to create Density, a real-time open-source app for study space availability. In this talk, we will use the Density API to explore internet usage and understand user behavior on campus with pandas' datetime functionality and seaborn."
