description: "You've got your tests, your metrics, your database migrations and your system provisioning automated, but how can you deploy everything with a push of a button and not be scared something goes wrong? Welcome to the continuous PHP Pipeline. In this talk I take the code, the tests, the metrics and the provisioners and show you how you can have a continuous delivery pipeline setup based on certain criteria you define upfront, your code gets automatically deployed to staging or to production with all the arbitrary tasks along with it. Never get stressed again about deployments. Make deployments as easy as committing to your repository and get home on time to enjoy your well deserved weekend.\n\nhttps://joind.in/talk/view/14262\n\nSlides : http://in2.se/phppipeline\n\nCette vidéo vous a plu ?
