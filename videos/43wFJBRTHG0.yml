description: "Ask Your Proxy, It Knows Everything - Blake Mizerany, Backplane\n\nProxies have long been layered into distributed systems but rarely do we lean on them to do more than route, and balance load. In this talk we will go over how to use proxies to replace Service Discovery, control Release Managment and Traffic Shaping, and streamline Employee on-boarding/off-boarding. You'll talk away never looking at your proxies/load-balancers the same.\n\nAbout Blake Mizerany\nFounder / CTO, Backplane\nSinatra, Heroku, Doozer, Etcd, Backplane"
