description: "Natasha Gregori - Hacktivists to Activists - Making the Transition\n\nIn 1999 The ACPM was formed with the goal of removing child pornography on the Internet via any means possible. After an initial announcement on HNN, and recruitment at DefCon 7, we began the daunting task of shutting down Child Porn Sites.\n\nInitially successfully, we found that the sites we took down would come back up after a few days or weeks. Not only would they return, but it became increasingly more difficult to take them down. We were not effectively removing sites, just making them stronger. A Change in tactics was necessary, and so the transformation to ACPO began.\n\nThe transformation into a \"legit\" activist group from our beginnings in the H/P/A community did not occur without its own pains. Some felt we were becoming \"soft\" on child pornography and left. Others joined, not deterred by our history. We have come to form strong bonds with law enforcement internationally, and have had success at identifying both those that\ntraffic and receive child pornography.\n\nRecent articles in apbnews.com, cbsnews.com, and wired.com have focused on ethical \"hacker\" groups fighting child porn have featured ACPO and Condemned.org, who is currently in the process of \"going legit\".\n\nIn my Talk I (and possibly Rloxy of condemned.org) will present the problems which convinced us that hacktivism was not the appropriate path, the transition process into an activist group, and the benefits the transition has has brought us. \n\nDEF CON 8.0 was held July 28th - 30th, 2000, in Las Vegas, Nevada USA"
