description: "Next-Generation Microservices on Kubernetes - by Paul McLoughlin & Sachin Kamboj, Bloomberg LP\n\n\"Enterprise deployments are complicated. When managing proprietary technologies, sensitive client data and complex rules for access rights you inevitably arrive at a situation where your PROD environment diverges from your DEV and there is no certainty that your code will work in production. You wrote an update, your unit and integration tests pass, yet your cursor is still floating half-heartedly over the 'RELEASE' button. Sounds familiar?\n\nTime to end deploy-watch-it-break-rollback-fix-rinse-and-repeat approach. Paul and Sachin present DTP-on-kubernetes - the next-generation microservices platform at Bloomberg, allowing you to run several versions of your microservice in parallel against the same requests, diff their output and trace messages through the system. On top of that, enjoy the deployment in seconds, brought down from hours.\n\nLearn what impact DTP is having on Bloomberg and how Kubernetes helped to make this system robust and stable (and of course enterprise-ready).\""
