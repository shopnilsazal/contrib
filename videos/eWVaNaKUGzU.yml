description: "ClojureBridge\nClojureBridge aims to increase diversity within the Clojure community by offering free, beginner-friendly workshops for women modeled on the work of RailsBridge. In April 2014, we will put on our first workshop in Durham, NC, followed soon by a workshop in San Francisco.\n\nWhat does it mean to teach Clojure to beginners - both beginners to programming and beginners to functional programming? We have learned a number of lessons by looking at the models of those who have come before us as well as in the process of developing this new curriculum.\n\nSince we announced the ClojureBridge effort at Clojure/conj in November 2013, more than 500 people have registered interest at clojurebridge.org. There is huge interest in the Clojure community in beginner materials both for those who want to learn it and those who want to share it.\n\nApprenticeships: I implore you!\nThe increase in web development vocational programs means a steady supply of junior developers, but are we prepared to help them become productive members of our teams?\n\nThese programs were created in response to the need for more developers, but I fear without apprenticeships to bridge the gap, we're simply moving the bottleneck upstream.\n\nIn the absence of an established, structured program, I've had to figure out what it means to be a software apprentice and ensure I'm building skills and learning best practices daily. Conversely, the senior developers have had to think about how to integrate apprentices and provide purposeful learning opportunities.\n\nIn this talk, I'll share my experience coming from a vocational web development school and the apprenticeship program we're developing at Democracy Works, Inc."
