description: "RailsConf 2017: Built to last: A domain-driven approach to beautiful systems by Andrew Hao\n\nHelp! Despite following refactoring patterns by the book, your aging codebase is messier than ever. If only you had a key architectural insight to cut through the noise.\n\nToday, we'll move beyond prescriptive recipes and learn how to run a Context Mapping exercise. This strategic design tool helps you discover domain-specific system boundaries, leading to highly-cohesive and loosely-coupled outcomes. With code samples from real production code, we'll look at a domain-oriented approach to organizing code in a Rails codebase, applying incremental refactoring steps to build stable, lasting systems!"
