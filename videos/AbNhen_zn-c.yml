description: "Droidcon Paris 2015\nAs developers we spend way too much time waiting for things. We all know waiting is no fun and we’d rather spend time developing and testing our app. Sometimes we’re waiting on our integration test suite, sometimes it’s our app, but quite often Gradle is the time waster. The latter is often regarded as a black box that’s way slower than Ant/Eclipse ever was, and that’s saying something!\n\nIn this session we’ll see how having a deeper understanding of your Gradle build can help you identify major bottlenecks. We’ll look at how minimizing the configuration and dependency resolution overhead helps to reduce your cycle times when using host-based tools, like the new unit testing support, Robolectric or JRebel for Android. We’ll also explore ways of structuring your project in a way that takes advantage of Gradle incremental builds. \n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/madisp/squeezing-the-last-drop-of-performance-out-of-your-gradle-builds-droidcon-paris-2015\n\nDroidcon Paris 2015, more information here: http://droidcon.fr/schedule/"
