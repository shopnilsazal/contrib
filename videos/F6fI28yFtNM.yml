description: "Speaker : Uri Shaked (BlackBerry)\n\nOur brain is a fascinating machine. Thanks to recent advancements in EEG technology, we are finally able to begin interfacing with it and build \"thought-controlled\" interfaces. In this talk, we are going to experiment in connecting our brains to an Angular app, using an affordable consumer EEG headset and Web Bluetooth, and then use RxJS to process the brain signals and feed them as events to our components. This gives a whole new meaning to the term \"Smart Component\", in a mind bending way."
