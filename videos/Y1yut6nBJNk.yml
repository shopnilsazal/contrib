description: 'The next LISA Conversation is Tuesday, March 29 from 3:30-4:30 p.m. Pacific Time and features Caskey Dickson, a LISA15 presenter who spoke to us about using "Technical Debt" to describe the horrors under the covers. Why doesn''t management get the same sense of impending doom that we do? Because management thinks debt is good! Debt is an essential part of business and part of managing risk in business operations. Watch his LISA15 talk now: https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program/presentation/dickson.'
