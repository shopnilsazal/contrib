description: "Rich Archbold, Intercom\n\nAt Intercom, we believe that to enable us to:\n\nimprove availability and reduce risks,\nsave time and money,\nimprove operability,\nand enable us to move fast for the long term\nwe should build and run Intercom using the smallest sensible set of core infrastructure components.\nwe are cautious about adding new technologies to the mix\nwe’d often rather consider using one of our existing/established technology components and write (and maintain) more software ourselves, rather than taken on the overhead of learning and maintaining expertise in a new / more powerful technology.\nwhere tools, systems or workflows are required to support building/managing Intercom, especially in areas that could be deemed “undifferentiated heavy lifting”, we’d rather not write any software or operate any systems ourselves at all, and instead use world-class 3rd-party services.\nWe summarise this beliefs in a infrastructure design principle we call “run less software, use less bits”.\n\nIn this talk we use some real examples to go deep on how we use this principle to make hard decisions and good, informed, deliberate trade offs.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
