title: 'Recommendation Engines using Machine Learning, and JRuby by Matt Kirk'
recordingDate: 1326922100
description: 'Ever wonder how netflix can predict what rating you would give to a movie? How do recommendation engines get built? Well, it''s possible with JRuby and it''s fairly straight forward. Many engines are built purely on support vector machine regressions which map arrays of data onto a classifier, like a star. In this talk I''ll explain how support vector machines are built, and how do make a simple movie prediction model all in JRuby.'
