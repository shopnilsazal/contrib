description: 'Dark Mail is not the only solution in the secure mail space, but just as Lavabitâ€™s preoccupation with privacy and user autonomy was a rarity when it started over a decade ago, it hopes once again to push mail security forward into a new frontier. It is Dark Mail''s objective to achieve the highest degree of security possible - with the introduction of an interoperable mail protocol as an open standard. To that end, we are publishing documents describing the protocol, along with a reference implementations of the client and server under a free software license.'
