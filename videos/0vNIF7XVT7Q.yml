description: "Yves - Performance Python for Numerical Algorithms\n[EuroPython 2014]\n[23 July 2014]\n\nThis talk is about several approaches to implement high performing numerical algorithms and applications in Python. It introduces into approaches like vectorization, multi-threading, parallelization (CPU/GPU), dynamic compiling, high throughput IO operations.\nThe approach is a practical one in that every approach is illustrated by specific Python examples.\n\n-----\n\nThis talk is about several approaches to implement high performing numerical algorithms and applications in Python. It introduces into approaches like multi-threading, parallelization (CPU/GPU), dynamic compiling, high throughput IO operations.\n\nThe approach is a practical one in that every approach is illustrated by specific Python examples.\n\nThe talk uses, among others, the following libraries:\n\n* NumPy\n* numexpr\n* IPython.Parallel\n* Numba\n* NumbaPro\n* PyTables"
