description: "Geoff French - An Introduction to Deep Learning\n[EuroPython 2016]\n[22 July 2016]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/an-introduction-to-deep-learning)\n\nDeep learning: how it works, how to train a deep neural network, the\ntheory behind deep learning, recent developments and applications.\n(length: 60 mins)\n\n-----\n\n(length: 60 mins)    In the last few years, deep neural networks have\nbeen used to generate state of the art results in image\nclassification, segmentation and object detection. They have also\nsuccessfully been used for speech recognition and textual analysis. In\nthis talk, I will give an introduction to deep neural networks. I will\ncover how they work, how they are trained, and a little bit on how to\nget going. I will briefly discuss some of the recent exciting and\namusing applications of deep learning. The talk will primarily focus\non image processing.\n\nIf you completely new to deep learning, please attend T. Rashid's talk\n'A Gentle Introduction to Neural Networks (with Python)'. His talk is\nin the same room immediately before mine and his material is really\ngood and will give you a good grounding in what I will present to you.\n:)\nYou may also want to attend I' Lewis' talk 'Deep Learning with Python\n& TensorFlow' after Lunch in the PyCharm room to round it all off! :)"
