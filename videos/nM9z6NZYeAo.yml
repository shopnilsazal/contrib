recordingDate: 1392712182
description: "Inertia - Introducing nmrcOS\nIntroducing nmrcOS\n\nnmrcOS provides a secure environment for the modern hacker-type to call home, which would help protect the privacy and security of the users of the system. In addition, it provides a portable working environment for the hacker on the goâ€” easy loading on simple hardware, no-nonsense command-line for uber control, yet usable by most people out of the box.\n\nDiscussion will focus on the history of the project and current design choices. Details on how to develop for the system will also be presented. Presentation includes demonstration of installation and configuration.\n\nInertia can neither confirm nor deny that he/she is a member of the Nomad Mobile Research Centre, an international group of hackers that explore technology. Further, it cannot be determined if he/she is co-author of ncrypt, a secure encryption tool. It is unknown whether Inertia's latest project involves the development of nmrcOS, the official NMRC distribution of Linux."
