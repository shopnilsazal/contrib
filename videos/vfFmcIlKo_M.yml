description: "80% of the time in every project is spent on data integration: Getting the data you want the way you want it. This problem remains challenging despite 40 years of attempts to solve it. We want a reliable, low latency system that can handle varied data from wide range of data management systems. We want a solution that is easy to manage and easy to scale. Is it too much to ask?\n\nIn this presentation, weâ€™ll discuss the basic challenges of data integration and introduce design and architecture patterns that are used to tackle these challenges. We will explore how these patterns can be implemented using Apache Kafka and share pragmatic solutions that many engineering organizations used to build fast, scalable and manageable data pipelines."
