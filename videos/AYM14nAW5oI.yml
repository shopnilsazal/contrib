description: "Finally coding again! We begin populating our components with mock data. In doing that, we stumble upon the ternary operator and the reduce() function.\n\nMore on ternary (? :) operator\nâ™¥ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator\n\nMore on logical (&&) operator\nâ™¥ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators\n\nMPJ explaining .reduce()\nâ–º https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl98eZpkp-c\n\nðŸ”— The code from this episode\nhttps://github.com/mpj/better-playlists/tree/04548f3231d2a10538eab91835fdc14d7e0b7551\n\n- - -\n\nIn this series we'll go from start to finish in building a fully functioning high-fidelity prototype with OAuth2 authentication and API connections fetching real data. The user will experience the prototype with her own stuff in it!\n\nWe do this by using React JS https://reactjs.org/ - a great JavaScript framework for building front-end components. We will even do some back-end to handle authentication eventually.\n\nAnd yes, this is not Travis - David and MPJ are filling in!\n\n- - -\n\nThis video was sponsored by the DevTips Patron Community - https://www.patreon.com/DevTips\n\nListen to Travis' Podcast - http://www.travandlos.com/\n\nGet awesomeness emailed to you every thursday - http://travisneilson.com/notes \n\nYou should follow DevTips on Twitter - https://twitter.com/DevTipsShow\n\nMPJ's channel on programming Fun Fun Function is great  - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/funfunfunction\n\nDavid is known as Data David discussing analytics and data - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0TQC6ZPNm23dU6ecc5x0Gg"
