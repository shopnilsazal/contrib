description: "How to be a WiFi Ninja\nPilgrim Matthew Shuchman\n\nAs one of the founders of WarDrivingWorld.com, where over the past few years we have sold thousands of WiFi devices and antennas for Pen testing and extended range WiFi, I will be presenting simple, but very effective techniques for extending the range of WiFi beyond the standard 15-30 meter range to 3-5 km, or more using home brew components.\n\nPilgrim is an ancient hacker who came from the tombs of Egypt. In those days punch cards ruled the world. Well with maturity may come intelligence and he founded WarDrivingWorld and enjoys teaching. He was formerly a government economist, has published business books and articles, and owned a network company. He lives in Florida with his dog Jack and enjoys playing with WiFi for fun and profit."
