So, I'm always looking for another one.\n\nHealthy side of functional programming\n\nWhen discussing programming paradigms a lot of attention is paid to the mathematics and technology. What is missing is the impact they have on the dev's health. Combining ergonomics and cognitive psychology, this talk will try to demonstrate that functional programming inherently requires less typing and less reading, which is better for wrists, spine and eyes. Functional programming is also better aligned with how a human brain works, thus putting less cognitive load and reducing stress.\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2018/bartlomiej-gorny"
