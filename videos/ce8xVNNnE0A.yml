recordingDate: 1466056471
description: "In the past few years hackerspaces came to the world to create a creative and hacky environment for the people but we need something for the younger ones. Let’s call them mini-hackers, junior-nerds, the techchilds or the coding-kids.\n\nMost kids aren’t exposed to interesting hacking stuff at their schools and the situation is pretty much the same here in The Netherlands – the main subject is always general studies. These junior-nerds and techchilds don’t fit in to this square hole and belong in a ‘hacky classroom’ – one which teaches real tech subjects. With this in mind, we decided to start something new for kids like these – we call it HITC – Hack in The Class.\n\n======\n\n\n\nBarry ‘Fish’ van Kampen is an enthusiast hacker and thinker full of ideas and energy. During his technologic journeys, he made a lot of friends in the hacker(space) community. As part of the HITB Core crew he is co-organising HITB Amsterdam since 2010. He is also the chairman and one of the founders of Randomdata, a hackerspace in Utrecht. As a professional, he is the MD of The S-Unit with a great passion for technology."
