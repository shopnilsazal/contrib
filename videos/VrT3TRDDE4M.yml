description: "A regular expression (or regex) is way to find strings within strings. It's small code that when applied to a string, will give other strings - either the whole string or parts of the string. This video gives you the ULTRA BASICS of REGEX.\n\nRegexes most common use cases are:\nWhat can we use them for?\n\n1. Validation\nIf something is formatted correctly. Like verifying if someone has inputted the correct things in a form like an email address or a postal code\n\n2.Extraction\nExtract parts of a string that we would like to use. Say find how many times someone wrote \"david\" in a text.\n\nReplacement\nFind all parts of the string with \"david\" and replace them with something else like \"devtips\".\n\nYou will learn:\n- creating regex in two ways in JavaScript: slash notation or with the constructor new RegExp()\n- escaping the special characters\n- the special characters and how they work: ^, $, *, +, [a-z], [0-9], \\w, \\d for example\n\n\n\nCompanion code used in the episode\nhttps://codepen.io/devtips/pen/gzqKKP\n\nOr try one of these tools to experiment with regexes. They all do basically the same, it's just a matter of taste:\nhttps://www.regexpal.com/\nhttps://www.regexpal.com/\nhttps://regex101.com/\n\nRead more on MDN, it's the best resource:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions"
