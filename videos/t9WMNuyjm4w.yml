description: "Tank Tactics was a simple strategy game that was played by 17 employees of Halfbrick Studios. 8 days later it was banned from the workplace. People got upset, rivalries formed, and two employees in particular still don't speak to each other to this day. So the question is, whose fault is all of this? Was it the players' fault for taking the game too seriously, or the designers' fault for creating a system that fosters such destructive social behavior? This 2013 GDC talk from Halfbrick Studios' Luke Muscat explores the story of Tank Tactics, and examine how the mechanics of this game, and many others, influence player behaviors.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
