description: "Establishing Container Trust at Scale [I] - Tim Mackey, Black Duck Software\n\nQuantifying risks in a container image is a critical aspect of production deployments. With orchestration clusters supporting thousands of nodes, any risk assessment solution must work at production scale. Once a trusted image is deemed vulnerable, application risk increases, but which applications are impacted, and how far has trust been broken? Trust is established through best practices including the use of trusted image registries, static code analysis, fuzzing, strong perimeter defenses and deployment controls. Unfortunately, this trust model omits information flow.\nMalicious actors succeed when applications are most vulnerable. When devising action plans in response to security disclosures, defenders must quickly assess both the impact and scope of the disclosure. This time to remediation requires accurate and actionable vulnerability assessments as applications are created, deployed and scaled. Enhancing security information flow accelerates risk mitigation at production scale.\n\nAbout Tim Mackey\nTim Mackey is a technology evangelist for Black Duck Software specializing in the secure deployment of applications using virtualization, cloud and container technologies.
