description: "TDD For Your Soul: Virtue Through Software Development by Abraham Sangh\n\nWeb development pushes us to our limits, not only of cognition, but, perhaps surprisingly, of character. Using the cardinal virtues as a framework, we can see that developers need courage to learn, temperance to prioritize goals, a sense of justice by which to discern obligations, and wisdom to choose our path. By being honest about where we lack virtue, and implementing steps to develop character, we can perform test-driven development on ourselves. This process can help us grow not only as developers, but as human beings.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/IMmw/"
