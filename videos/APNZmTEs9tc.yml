description: "GDB: A Gentle Intro by Jason Clark\n\nWe love Ruby’s elegance, simplicity, and flexibility. But our favorite language perches atop a world of native code. When that other world intrudes on your peaceful Ruby, GDB, the venerable GNU debugger, is the tool to turn to.\n\nWe’ll examine setting up Ruby to work with GDB. We’ll learn the fundamental commands, and soon you’ll be debugging with ease. We’ll even peer deep into Ruby object internals and face down crashes, deadlocks, and bugs.\n\nWhether you’re writing a native gem, hacking the Ruby VM, or just want a glimpse of the layers below, this talk is for you!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H0nH/"
