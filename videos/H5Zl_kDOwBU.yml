description: "The Easy--Don't Drive Yourself Crazy--Way to Kubernetes Networking [B] - Gerard Hickey, Smartsheet\n\nImplementing Kubernetes is not technically difficult, but the networking layer continues to confuse and cause implementation problems for those new to Kubernetes. Not everyone is capable of using GKE and may need to implement Kubernetes in an on-prem facility. Certainly there is a wealth of online documentation to assist new users but some of this documentation is contradictory due when the documentation was written and the multitude of network stacks available. \n\nThis presentation attempts to provide clarity for new implementers and those wishing to understand Kubernetes networking better. The content covers how networking is accomplished in the Kubernetes environment and the reasons why it is implemented differently than traditional network environments. In addition, several of the popular network stacks will be reviewed to provide attendees with knowledge to make a better informed decision when choosing between network stacks.\n\nAbout Gerard Hickey\nGerard Hickey is a Principal Systems Engineer at Smartsheet where he is building the next generation data center for the world's leading collaboration solution. He has spent the past decade working with and implementing the latest technologies in an effort to provide better automation. In addition, he is active with the open source community providing bug fixes and patches to several projects and in his spare time he works on a number of Raspberry Pi and ESP8266 home automation projects."
