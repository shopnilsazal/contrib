description: "by Miroslav Mazel\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nI've been running a local meet-up centered around designing for FOSS and doingit thoroughly, choosing MuseScore as our first project. The meet-up hasattracted people inexperienced with both UX design and scorewriting and it'sbeen a good learning experience.\n\nI'll talk about my experience with running a local meet-up, where we worked ondesigning MuseScore, an open-source scorewriting program, with a group ofvolunteers that had little to no prior experience with both the UX designprocess and with scorewriting. The design process we're going through isrigorous, including stakeholder and user research, persona creation,scenarios, and the like.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 14:30:00"
