description: 'Fun with Mind Reading: Today, we have the technology to “read minds” (well, EEG waves!). Using a headset from Emotiv, I’ve captured the big data stream of EEG coming out of our heads. In this session, I will show the detection of facial expressions and emotional state, and training a machine learning model to employ mental commands (making a virtual object move via thought). Then, I will walk through and share my results on a “lie detector” experiment comparing brain waves when telling the truth and lying. I have built classifiers based on the EEG data using Azure Machine Learning to predict whether a subject is telling the truth, which I will demonstrate. The effectiveness of multiple classifiers can be easily compared. This session will be a fun look inside your brain waves along with demonstrations of data processing and predictive analytics. Attendees will gain exposure to the Emotiv EPOC headset and Azure Machine Learning.'
