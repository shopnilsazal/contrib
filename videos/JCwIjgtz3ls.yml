description: "DEF CON 16 - Anthony Martinez & Thomas Bowen : Toasterkit, a modular NetBSD rootkit.\nNetBSD is a portable operating system for just about every architecture available. There is a notable lack of tools available for the penetration tester. In this talk we will present Toasterkit, a generic NetBSD rootkit. It has been tested on i386, Mac PPC, and VAX systems.\n\nAnthony Martinez is a system administrator for the New Mexico Tech Computer Center, and an undergraduate Computer Science student at the university.\n\nThomas Bowen is a system administrator for the New Mexico Tech Computer Center, and an undergraduate student in Computer Science with emphasis in Information Assurance. He has been accepted into Scholarship for Service program, funded by the National Science Foundation, and plans to also complete his Masters of Science in Computer Science at the university. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
