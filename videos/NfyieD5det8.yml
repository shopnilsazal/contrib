description: "How NEO4J Saved my Relationship by Coraline Ada Ehmke\n\nRelational databases have come a long way in the past decade, but sometimes complex data models (a map of network infrastructure, or a quantum-entangled network of social relationships) call for a different approach. How can we address these sorts of modeling challenges? This talk will explore practical uses of Neo4J, a graph database designed to solve the problems of connections and relations that are too complex for traditional relational databases. We'll learn about managing and querying highly connected data and explore the power of graph databases in taming our complex data problems.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/IG24/"
