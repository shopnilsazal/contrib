description: "by Gratien D'haese\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nRelax-and-Recover (ReaR) is a bare metal Disaster Recovery tool that can saveyou hours (and sometimes days) to recover a system from scratch in case offailure. However, for us developers before making a new release it is a realnightmare to test all the different Linux distributions in combination withall the known workflows that ReaR provides. It used to be a manual process oftesting the recovery, but we are in progress to automate the whole process forsome workflows. We will explain the internals of how we do automated testingand we will give a live demo as well.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 14:45:00"
