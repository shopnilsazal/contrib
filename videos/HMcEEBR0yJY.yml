title: 'RubyConf 2014 - Rsense Knows Your Code by Eric West'
recordingDate: 1419262105
description: "Rsense brings the kind of static analysis tooling to Ruby that programmers in other languages take for granted. The kind of tooling I kept hearing was impossible to implement for Ruby. Accurate type inference, code completion, definition finding, and eventually so much more. How about a real refactoring tool, or the ability to find whole classes of bugs without executing the code? This is where Rsense is headed.\n\nLearn how Rsense does its magic, find out how you can use it to improve your daily coding experience, where it's going next and where you can pitch in to make rsense even better.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Fqsu/"
