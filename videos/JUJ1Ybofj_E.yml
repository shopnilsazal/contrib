title: '#HITBGSEC 2017 CommSec D2 - 200+ Vulnerabilities In Android Phones - B. Guangdong & Z. Qing'
recordingDate: 1506220789
description: "Android Fragmentation has been recognized as a significant cause of booming Android security issues. In this talk, we will demonstrate our deep analysis of this infamous problem by using Samsung which is a major manufacturer of Android phones as a case study.\n\nWe will present more than 200 security vulnerabilities we have found in our research. These vulnerabilities commonly exist in Samsung phones such as s8+, S7, S7 edage and Galaxy C9 Pro. Most vulnerabilities take Samsung a long time to fix, and some of them even last for half a year.\n\nIn the vulnerabilities we have identified, we would like to highlight one we find in settings. We will demonstrate how attackers can completely bypass the authentication mechanisms on Samsung phones, including iris recognition, pattern, password and fingerprint, and abuse payment functions like Samsung pay, by exploiting this vulnerability. We also find that similar vulnerabilities exist in other Android OS such as Huawei and so on. We will reveal how these vulnerabilities differ in each platform. A live demo or video demonstrating these vulnerabilities will be given on the conference.\n\nFinally, we will reveal the differences between the variant Android OS in Samsung’s phones and the Google’s official AOSP, and analyze how these differences result in the vulnerabilities which never exist in Android Pixel especially in android N. Based on this, we will summarize the typical patterns of inappropriate implementation and modification of AOSP on samsung.\n\n=== \n\nDr. Bai Guangdong is a faculty member in Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT). He received his PhD degree from National University of Singapore in 2015. His research interest spans across the broad areas of mobile security, web security, and protocol verification. During his previous research, he has worked on analyzing authentication protocol implementation, online payment, and Android security. His research has helped identify and fix serious security vulnerabilities for major websites like Sina Weibo. His work appears in top security conferences, such as NDSS and Black Hat Europe.\n\n--- \n\nZHANG Qing is an independent researcher on Android security from xiaomi. Previously, he was a senior Android security researcher of Qihoo 360 and  visiting scholar of Model Checking Lab in National University of Singapore. He currently works as a senior information security engineer of Xiaomi, in  charge of account risk control and IOT devices security. His interests include Android security, web security and payment security, specializing in  reverse engineering and fuzzing. His work has appeared at syscan360 2016 and Black Hat aisa 2017. In 2016, he won whole year’s first-place prizes in  vulnerability detection of some major Chinese companies, such as Huawei, meizu and xiaomi."
