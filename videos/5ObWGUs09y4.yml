recordingDate: 1384933776
description: "RAID Recovery: Recover your PORN by Sight and Sound\nScott Moulton Forensic Strategy Services, LLC. / System Specialist\n\nThis talk will focus on RAID reassembly. In both Forensics and Data Recovery it is common for there to be PORN not only in Pictures but also in Sound Files and Video Files. The goal is $100 or less, figure out how to reconstruct RAID 0 and RAID 5 arrays using the PORN on the array to help identify the correct order of the drives and the variations in the slice size. This is a demo of how to use those files to figure out the layout for the RAID and how to find the right configuration when it is unknown using PORN.\n\nScott Moulton is a data recovery specialist and forensic expert out of Atlanta at My Hard Drive Died where he uses his forensics experience to recover hard drives. Currently Scott Moulton is teaching classes on physically rebuilding damaged hard drives for SANS in a course titled SEC606 Forensic Data Recovery.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
