description: "Chris Paget: US-VISIT: Raping Personal Privacy Since 2004\n\nAbstract: In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security began the deployment of US-VISIT?a system for tracking visitors to the United States. Since that time, the capabilities of US-VISIT have increased dramatically; US-VISIT now incorporates a number of controversial technologies which violate the privacy, anonymity, and overall security of visitors to the USA in significant ways. In this talk, the technology and capabilities of US-VISIT will be explained in detail; weaknesses in the system will be explored, and the consequences of such a system will be considered. If you are a foreign national visiting the USA, a US citizen who is concerned about what DHS has in store for you, or just curious about what US-VISIT does and how it works, this is the talk for you.\n\n Bio: Chris Paget is the Director of Research and Development for IOActive Inc, based in Seattle. Recently, Chris has been working on the \"biggest independent security audit in history\"?the Final Security Review of Windows Vista. Chris is an expert on Windows architecture and security, a privacy advocate, a British expatriate, a helicopter pilot, and a Code Red junkie."
