description: "By Jamison Dance\n\nBuilding things that interact with the physical world can be profoundly satisfying. However, if you work high up the abstraction ladder hardware hacking can seem a scary place full of scary things like assembly, microcontrollers, C, solder fumes, and the risk of death by electrocution. Fear not! None of those things are actually scary. Okay, death is scary, but highly unlikely!\nWe'll learn how JavaScript makes it super easy to get started hacking on hardware, including Arduinos, drones, and a few other gadgets. We'll also show off some live demos of some working projects, and the code that powers them. Hardware hacking is fun, and you can do it.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG20/"
