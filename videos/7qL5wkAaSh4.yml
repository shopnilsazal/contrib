Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nGetting Started with Logging in Kubernetes - Eduardo Silva, Treasure Data (Any Skill Level)\n\nA good practice when deploying applications in Kubernetes is to set proper instrumentation to gather insights and solve general monitoring needs. Logging is a fundamental piece of the instrumentation cycle and is continually evolving to solve pains associated with unstructured formats, performance and monitoring. In this presentation you will learn the concepts involved in log processing for containerized applications. You will also be introduced to these hot new features in Logging: metering the logging pipeline with Prometheus, performance improvements, scalability and the ability to customize the log processor behavior through declarative resource annotations.\n\nAbout Eduardo\nEduardo is an Open Source Software Engineer at Treasure Data. He currently leads the efforts to make logging more scalable in Containerized and Orchestrated systems such as Kubernetes."
