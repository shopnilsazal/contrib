description: "Heroku makes it quick and easy to get your app up and running without worrying about \"server stuff\". But that server stuff is a lot simpler than it seems and once you know it, can make your projects more flexible (and save a lot of money!).\n\nI'll start by looking at the basics of what's happening behind the scenes when you deploy a Rails app and why you might want to setup your own server. Then I'll look at the tools you'll need to do so and some common gotchas when getting started.\n\nRails Developer, author of 'Reliably Deploying Rails Applications'. Avid indoor climber. Believer in \"Small Steps Taken Quickly\".\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1w/"
