description: "Life of a Kubernetes API Request - Daniel Smith, Google\n\nWe'll follow an API request through the Kubernetes API stack, starting from kubectl and ending with the storage layer (etcd). This is targeted at people who want to develop Kubernetes itself. We will look at code snippets! (This is a talk I have given internally at Google.)\n\nAbout Daniel Smith (lavalamp)\nOne of the first Kubernetes team members, I currently lead the Kubernetes API Machinery team within Google."
