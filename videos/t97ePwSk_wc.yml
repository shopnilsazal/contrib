recordingDate: 1369877159
description: "By Rebecca Miller-Webster and Savannah Wolf\n\nDevelopers: how many times have you had to completely rip out your hard earned code for a totally new site design? \nDesigners: how many times has a re-design taken 4 times as long as the developer said it would and not looked good in the end?\nChange all that by using an incremental approach to design. Set up your code to change all the buttons at once or prioritize design changes to make each small change good enough for production.\nA designer and developer will talk about the challenges and joys of making this process work in two production sites.\nTopics covered: \n* What is incremental design? \n* How to design with incremental changes in mind \n* How to develop for incremental design, including utilizing SASS, structuring your mark-up and CSS, and structuring your Rails views and partials\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG9V/"
