description: "The underground market offers everything from accommodation, to flight tickets and car rental.\n\nThis presentation covers research of underground travel fraud schemes which are frequently exploited for profit. This includes a variety of abuses, from credit card fraud to exploitation of vulnerabilities in traveling systems and platforms and mileage programs.\n\nWe cover a number of typical cases that we encountered in our investigation, studying the victim perspective of the fraud, the “customer” side, and the criminal actor side. With this talk we hope to bring more attention to the on-going criminal activities that proliferate in the hospitality and travel industries.\n\n=== \n\nVladimir Kropotov is a researcher with Trend Micro FTR team.
