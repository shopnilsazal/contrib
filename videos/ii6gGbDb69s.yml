description: "By BJ Clark \nIn this session we'll take a hands on approach to building reusable and scaleable front end code in a Ruby application. We walk through building a modern web application UI using microformats, gracefully degrading CSS3 and Javascript closures and bunch of ruby tools that make it easy to do this. We'll finish up by seeing how the same code can be used throughout an application with little modification.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HgW7/"
