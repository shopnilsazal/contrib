description: "Designing in the open - The UX of UX How does this thing called open source design work, or doesn't work. Maybe?\nby Raghu Nayyar\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nOpen source software has always been engineering driven. Most of the peoplebuilding open source software are engineers with major turn on for featuresand more features which kind of explains how a lot of open source projectshave rich and extremely important features but are a pain to see or work with.This talk aims to deal with this problem of designing in the open which isoften neglected. Tools like GitHub, GitLab, etc. can actually become an arenafor usability testing and give extremely promising output only if it followsan effective design process. This talk is also a practical guide for buddingdesigners to get started with open source software.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 10:00:00"
