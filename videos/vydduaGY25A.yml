description: "by Felipe Hoffa\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nGoogle has made available a BigQuery copy of most open source code shared inGitHub. This allows any interested party to analyze 5 years of GitHub metadataand more than 42 terabytes of code easily. In this session we'll cover how toleverage this data - to understand the community around any language orproject. With this, design requests and decisions can be made looking at theactual patterns discoverable through analytical methods.\n\nGoogle has made available a BigQuery copy of most open source code shared inGitHub.
