description: "DevOpsDelays Baltimore 2018 - A Retrospective in Incident Management with Nathen Harvey\n\nThis year DevOpsDays Baltimore faced a challenge of dealing with a possible weather emergency, and had to make some tough decisions based on an ever counting down clock and a fair amount of incomplete information. This panel will take a look at what happened and discuss how DevOps principles around Incident Management and Learning Reviews can help all organizations. We'll also get some audience participation and see if your confirmation biases match up with ours."
