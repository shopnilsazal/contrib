title: 'Coming to Grips With JavaScript Heavy Apps'
recordingDate: 1347203681
description: "As Rubyists, we love Ruby and want to write Ruby all the time. But when writing apps for the web, we need to come to grips with the increasing amount of JavaScript we need to write when building web applications. This means more than just a difference in the language: the JavaScript ecosystem looks a lot different than the Ruby ecosystem. Not only is the tooling much less mature than the tools we know and love when writing Ruby, but integrating a JavaScript application with a Ruby codebase still resembles black magic for many people.\n\nIn this talk, Yehuda will talk about his workflow for building Ruby-based applications that make heavy use of JavaScript, based on his recent and current experience building several such applications. He will cover building a consistent, consumable API in Rails, packaging your assets, and a good development environment."
