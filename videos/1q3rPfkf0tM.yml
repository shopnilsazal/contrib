description: "Abstract :\nThe talk covers practical solutions to storing passwords and secure ways to share those passwords. The solutions range from commercial to open source and even some roll your own.\n\nIt will also cover solutions that answer the question; “How do I allow others to access all my password after I am unavailable, incapacitated or dead?”\n\nI will review the current state of password key rings, password managers and vault systems available in commercial and open source forms. I will also talk about why you should be using password managers in your personal life and at your businesses to help manage the security of your passwords, share passwords safely, and how to recover from the unexpected.\nFinally I will cover Shamir’s Secret Sharing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing (SSS) as a solution that can be used to safely share passwords, following a dual control rule, where one shared part cannot be used to recover the password but can be used by t of n trusted persons to recover the password(s) and use SSS to access encrypted data.\n\nby Ty Shipman\n\nTy Shipman has 30+ years in the computer industry.
