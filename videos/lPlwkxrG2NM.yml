description: "\"Most ruby programmers use git in their daily use. I would like to show that git is beyond just commit and pull/push. I want to show how simple, the basic architecture of git is, so that people appreciate and understand it better.\n\nMy favorite reference on git is http://git-scm.com/book. I have a hard copy of the book. In fact, after getting inspired from the book, I conducted a training session on git internally in my company using these slides(http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51548306/git-hands-on-2.pptx)\n\nIn this session we will see how we can quickly customize git in Ruby and see the insides of Git. I will showcase commands like:\n\ngit open\n\nShows the content of any git object. We will use this to walk through a chain of commits, their trees and blob objects\n\ngit rollback\n\nReverts your last commit\n\ngit make subtree\n\nDoes everything required to do a subtree merge in your git repo\n\nThe whole presentation will be in terminal and we will explore the .git folder and see what the relevance, of a particular file/folder is.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG9F/"
