title: 'Designing Realities - Building experiences not games'
recordingDate: 1527812120
description: "The first wave of experiences that enter this new interactive world is coming to a close. Let's apply what we've learned and stop building discrete interactions or focusing on mechanics.  Instead, focus on building realities people want to live in. We've been making games for decades using these tools and now they're evolving to support so much more. Small adjustments can make all the difference in your application.\n\nKeith Bradner, from Bend Labs, will talk about why we need to evolve our design, and specific examples around what that means."
