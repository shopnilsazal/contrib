description: "Web Rebels is coming back in 2019 https://webrebels.org\n\nLuciano is a software engineer born in 1987, the same year that “Super Mario Bros” was released in Europe, which, by chance is his favourite game! He started coding early at the age of 12, hacking away with his father`s old i386 armed only with MS-DOS and the QBasic interpreter.\n\nHe has been professionally a software developer for more than 10 years and are currently a Solution Architect at Vectra AI in Dublin where he is working on automating the hunt for cyberattackers and speeding-up incident response.\n\nCracking JWT tokens: a tale of magic, Node.JS and parallel computing\nJWT tokens are powerful artifacts that magicians from all over the World are using to secure modern apps and APIs. But as any other magic tool, those powerful tokens need to be used with caution and mastery, otherwise, they might become dangerous exploitable vulnerabilities. In this talk, I will demonstrate how evil magicians can cast a JWT brute force spell to take control of poorly constructed JWT tokens."
