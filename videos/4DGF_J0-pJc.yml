title: 'DEF CON 14 - Riley "Caezar" Eller: Securing MANET'
recordingDate: 1391644722
description: "Riley \"Caezar\" Eller: Securing MANET\n\nAbstract: Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking (MANET) technology promises disaster-tolerant, interoperable, secure communications that work the way we users do. Features like automatic peer discovery and stable multi-transport TCP connections are so attractive that some may wonder if it isn't all too good to be true. After a brief but clear introduction to the more-or-less subtle differences between wireless routing technologies, we will delve directly into simulating attacks on Layers 2 and 3 and implementing appropriate defenses. Full graphical visualization of the processes and results makes this presentation accessible to anyone with at least basic understanding of computer networks.\n\n Bio: As a professional software developer, Caezar began his career in embedded operating system development. After bringing that company to the Internet and integrating a TCP/IP stack, his passion for networking ignited. After a brief stint performing security audits, Mr. Eller returned to software development as the principal architect Greg Hoglund's ClickToSecure. He is only now resurfacing after spending three years bringing security and quality of service to high-speed mobile networks. As the public face of the Ghetto Hackers, Caezar was central to DEFCON's Capture the Flag contest for the better part of a decade. During that time, he improved security contest scoring techniques, invented self-decoding ASCII-only stack exploits, produced fully automated web intrusion, and contributed to several other inventions including a pattern language for describing network attack processes. As a speaker and writer, his credits include BlackHat Training and Briefings, DevX Security Zone, Hack-Proofing Your Network, Meet the Enemy seminars, Stealing the Network, and one unfortunately brief appearance on a USENIX panel."
