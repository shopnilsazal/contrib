title: 'DEF CON 12 - Grifter, Russ Rogers and Tierra, Project Prometheus'
recordingDate: 1392703699
description: "Grifter, Russ Rogers and Tierra, Project Prometheus\nThe goal of Prometheus is to create an Open Source project that takes into account the inherent flaws in the Microsoft implementation of Alternate Data Streams (ADS) and uses those attributes to create a tool for increased security. The concept is similar to making lemonade from lemons. We\"re taking an insecure component of the NTFS file system and creating a tool that will provide increased security. Russ and Grifter will be explaining and demonstrating the use of Alternate Data Streams and then discussing an Open Source project which they have currently begun development on.\n\nGrifter has been involved in the scene for over a decade and currently runs 2600SLC, the Salt Lake City 2600 meeting, and DC801 the Utah Defcon meeting; where he often lectures on a range of security related topics. He has been published in numerous online and print publications and has previously been a speaker at several Defcons. He has also been the subject of interviews for various online, print, and television pieces regarding different areas of the hacker culture over the years. He is a Defcon Goon and primary organizer of the Defcon Scavenger Hunt and Defcon Movie Channel.\n\nRuss Rogers is the CEO and CTO of Security Horizon, a Colorado Springs based information security professional services firm and is a technology veteran with over 12 years of technology and information security experience. He has served in multiple technical and management information security positions that include Manager of Professional Services, Manager Security Support, Senior Security Consultant and Unix Systems Administrator. Mr. Rogers is a United States Air Force Veteran and has supported the National Security Agency and the Defense Information Systems Agency in both a military and contractor role. Russ is also an Arabic Linguist. He is a certified instructor for the National Security Agency's INFOSEC Assessment Methodology (IAM).\n\nTierra, while still somewhat new to the scene, has been manipulating bits since the 7th grade, and is currently working on his Computer Science degree at the University of Utah. He has been attending 2600 meetings for more than 3 years now in Salt Lake City, and has been helping run the Defcon Scavenger Hunt since Defcon 10 (you\"ll find him at the Scavenger Hunt table again this year). While working with the DC801 crew on projects such as this, he spends his time mastering his PHP and SQL skills on various personal projects such as TIMAP found on SourceForge."
