description: "by Berry Boessenkool\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe German Weather Service (DWD) provides over 25 thousand climate time seriesfrom meteorological stations across Germany via an FTP server, but it is notalways easy to find out which datasets are available. To facilitate fileselection and (automated) downloads, I developed an R package that can be usedto select, download, read and process weather data. The aim of the package isthat researchers can focus on scientific problems instead of data management.At FOSDEM, I would like to present the main instructions for the package, howthe FOSS community aided in putting it together, and give a brief outlook onthe potential analysis types. The package is FOSS athttps://github.com/brry/rdwd#rdwd\n\n\nRoom: H.2214\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 08:30:00"
