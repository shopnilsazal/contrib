description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2016 in Washington, DC\nhttps://2016.appsecusa.org/\n\nScaling Security Assessment at the Speed of DevOps\n\nRecent software development trends, namely DevOps, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment, have empowered developers and drastically reduced the DevTest window forcing teams to adopt highly automated test infrastructures. While the adoption of these trends and automated test frameworks have improved feature delivery and time to market, they have complicated security assessment, producing substantial gaps between the current release and the last security audited code. Consumers are now being forced to\nadopt new code releases daily or hourly without substantive security review, especially in the Software as a Service (SaaS) sector. As engineering teams rapidly embrace these development methodologies, the community must evolve security testing strategies so as to enhance the security posture of products, services, and solutions.\n\nThis evolution must address three primary problems elucidated by the\naforementioned development trends:\n\n1. Testability: Security requirements should be testable and verifiable.\n2. Scalability: Security requirement should be capable of being\nautomated in a best-effort fashion so as to scale effectively.\n3. Accessibility: Security tools and results should be easily digestible\nby software engineers and testers, and new security tools should be\naccessible to all development and test engineers.\n\nTherefore, we have developed and are preparing to open source a new distributed security testing framework called Norad which facilitates security assessment at scale. This framework automates multiple open-source and vendor security tools and aggregates their results for review. It also provides an SDK which promotes the development of community developed security test content. This talk will explain Norad's design philosophy, architecture, and demonstrate its usage.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\nBlake Hitchcock\nSoftware Engineer, Cisco\nBlake Hitchcock has been building and breaking web applications for 6 years with Cisco. He loves writing in Ruby, and 'Burp' is not just something he does after a few too many kielbasas. When he's not doing web stuff, Blake enjoys fitness, food, sports, and cheering for his beloved Tennessee Volunteers.\n\nBrian Manifold\nCisco\nBrian Manifold has worked as a software/security engineer at Cisco for the past 4 1/2 years. His main areas of interest at work are web development and web security. Outside of work he enjoys playing music, anything CNC (milling, 3d printing, etc..) related, hardware electronics, and spending time with his family.\n\n\nRoger Seagle\nPrincipal Engineer, Cisco\nRoger Seagle Jr. is a Principal Engineer in the STO TIP team at Cisco. Previously, he worked in Cisco's Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG) where he assessed the security posture of Cisco products and advised product teams on patching and mitigating vulnerabilities.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
