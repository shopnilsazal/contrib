description: "Vinicius Pacheco - APIs and Microservices With Go\n[EuroPython 2016]\n[19 July 2016]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/apis-and-microservices-with-go)\n\nIn this talk we show how the Go language helped us get a high\nperformance in a concise and simple API. Everything will be\nexemplified using the backdrop of a real case of Globo.com: API\nregistrations. We will see how we went from 200 to 19,000 records per\nsecond to the impacts of this rapid growth and the consequences of Go\nof use. We also show how our microservices architecture was used in\nthe project.\n\n-----\n\nThis talk is about Go, software architecture and parallelism. How we\nwent from legacy, complex and slow software to new, speed, resilient\nand maintainable software.\nI'll start the talk showing the problemas and the challenges that my\nteam had received. After that, I'll show the tests, tests of\nperformance and the options that we did considering technologies and\nstrategies of development. The difficulties and problems also will be\nshow. Also I talk about:\n\n- Goroutines\n- Resilient patterns\n- Go tools\n- Architecture\n- Web performance\n\nHow we leave of the Java ecosystem to new free ecosystem with\nmicroservices and how Go help us."
