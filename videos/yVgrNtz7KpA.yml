description: "RailsConf 2017: Managing Unmanageable Complexity by Patrick Joyce\n\nAs systems get more complex they inevitably fail. Many of those failures are preventable.\n\nWe’re not lazy, stupid, or careless. The complexity of our systems simply exceeds our cognitive abilities. Thankfully, we’re not alone. People have successfully managed complex systems long before software came along.\n\nIn this session, we’ll see how surgeons, pilots, and builders have developed techniques to safely manage increasingly complex systems in life and death situations. We will learn how simple checklists improve communication, reduce preventable errors, and drive faster recovery time."
