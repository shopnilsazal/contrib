description: "Keynote: Code Quality Lessons Learned Bryan Helmkamp\n\nWe started Code Climate with a simple hypothesis: static analysis can help developers ship better code, faster. Five years later, we analyze over 70,000 repositories each day spanning a wide variety of programming languages, and along the way we've learned a lot about code quality itself: what it means, why you want it, how you get it,and more. This talk will cover some of the more surprising insights, including what makes a code metric valuable, when unmaintainable code may be preferable, and the number one thing that prevents most developers from maintaining quality code over time.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/PsL5/"
