title: 'Failing Fast - Stuff We Should have Done Better at Square Erica Kwan'
recordingDate: 1326933174
description: "I work for a mobile payments company called Square. Square has a great development culture driven by a lot of smart people. Part of that culture includes acknowledging failures, figuring out what should have been done differently when failures occur, and learning how to fail less in the future.\n\nI'm going to discuss the mistakes made when developing a major Rails app feature, the struggle to increase test coverage for the Square iOS client, and the consequences of bad architectural decisions made when creating a distributed build system. I'll then talk about how each of these were addressed."
