description: "Everything must be connected right now! Go! Do it! It’ll be great….\n\nThen I’ll be able to order my Iced Half Caff Ristretto Venti 4-Pump Sugar Free Cinnamon Dolce Soy Skinny Latte so I can pick it up on the way to work as I cycle past the coffeee shop without breaking a sweat… Marvelous!\n\nWait, did I say “I’ll be able to order”? Sorry, what I meant was: “My bicycle will be able to order”, because, obviously, my bicycle saddle is connected to my home WiFi, so when it detects my bum hitting it’s surface, it will immediately notify my Home Automation system to take a picture of the pinboard in the kitchen which has an Epaper display showing a QRCode of exactly what’s today’s flavour of the month, which will be decoded and sent to the central Node.js system, which will…. Oh, f*ck it. I’ll just have a nice cup of tea instead.\n\nIn this talk we will discuss the fact that although time (mostly) moves in a linear direction, security doesn’t. In fact, it has an alarming tendancy to go backwards, sideways, and, very often, around and around in circles.\n\nIn our work at Aperture Labs, we spend our lives pulling embedded systems apart, only to find the same old issues hiding amongst the silicon and bits and bytes. There was a time when this didn’t matter too much… Yes, we could bypass some copy protection code and load a pirated game, or we could hop over an authentication routine and p0wn your router… Of course, that is BAD with a capital B, but nobody died. Cities didn’t go dark. Planes didn’t fall out of the sky…\n\nSo what happens when we take all our tech and connect it up to everthing around it, including our fridges, freezers, TVs, thermostats and anything else we can think of. And then we connect that to the Internet. And then, just for the hell of it, why not pass some laws that say we should connect our electricity, gas and water meters up as well? Sound like a plan?\n\nDid I say Hilarious?\n\nI think I meant something else…\n\n======\n\nAdam Laurie is a security consultant working the in the field of electronic communications, and a Director of Aperture Labs Ltd. (http://aperturelabs.com) who specialise in reverse engineering of secure embedded systems. He started in the computer industry in the late Seventies, working as a computer programmer on PDP-8 and other mini computers, and then on various Unix, Dos and CP/M based micro computers as they emerged in the Eighties. He quickly became interested in the underlying network and data protocols, and moved his attention to those areas and away from programming, starting a data conversion company which rapidly grew to become Europe’s largest specialist in that field (A.L. Downloading Services).\n\nDuring this period, he successfully disproved the industry lie that music CDs could not be read by computers, and wrote the world’s first CD ripper, ‘CDGRAB’. At this point, he became interested in the newly emerging concept of ‘The Internet’, and was involved in various early open source projects, the most well known of which is probably ‘Apache-SSL’ which he and his brother published, and which went on to become the de-facto standard secure web server. Since the late Nineties he has focused his attention on security, and has been the author of various papers exposing flaws in Internet services and/or software, as well as pioneering the concept of re-using military data centres housed in underground nuclear bunkers as secure hosting facilities.\n\nAdam aka “Major Malfunction” has been a senior member of staff at DEFCON since 1997 and is the POC for the London DEFCON chapter DC4420. Over the years has given presentations on forensics, magnetic stripe, EMV, InfraRed, RF, RFID, Terrestrial and  Satellite TV hacking, and, of course, Magic Moonbeams. He is the author and maintainer of the open source python RFID exploration library ‘RFIDIOt’, which can be found at http://rfidiot.org.\n\nblog: http://adamsblog.aperturelabs.com/\ngithub: https://github.com/AdamLaurie https://github.com/ApertureLabsLtd/\ntwitter: @rfidiot"
