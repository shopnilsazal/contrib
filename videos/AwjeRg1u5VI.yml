title: 'Rajat Arya - Deploying scikit learn Models in Production'
recordingDate: 1430493738
description: "PyData Dallas 2015\nMachine Learning should be everywhere. Applications today have the opportunity to leverage all the data being collected about users' interactions and behavior. Unfortunately machine learning at scale is mostly absent from production systems. Training models using scikit-learn is useful, but it is difficult to take this code to production. Why is it so painful to deploy models in a scalable way? What are the options and what challenges exist today? After exploring the current options, I will present Dato Predictive Services, which we developed to address these challenges. Dato Predictive Services enables deploying and managing scikit-learn models into an elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant, low-latency cluster of machines, in AWS & YARN. With Dato Predictive Services, in one command, you can take arbitrary Python and deploy it as a REST service.\n\nThis will be a hands-on talk, walking through code and with multiple demonstrations. Bring your laptop to follow along!\nView slides for this presentation here: http://www.slideshare.net/dato-inc/py-data-scikitproduction"
