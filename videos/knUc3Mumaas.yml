description: "Wilco van Ginkel - The Other Side of Information Security\nUntil now, the focus of Information Security within organisations was mainly technical. Organisations are becoming more and more aware of the fact that this technical side - although very important - is just one part of the total security solution. Currently, organisations are increasingly changing their focus to the organisational side of Information Security. In order to control the organisational issues of Information Security, an organisational oriented approach is needed. Such an approach will be the subject of this talk and will give the audience an overview, ideas, references, hints & tips of this organisational side. Items to be discussed are:\n# Risk Management\n# Security Policies & Procedures\n# Security Standards\n# Security Awareness\n# Security Auditing & Monitoring\n# Where Organisational meets Technical\n\nWilco has University backgrounds in Business Economics, Business Administration, Computer Science and Information Security. He has held positions as assistant teacher at the Erasmus University Rotterdam (NL), as Technical IT Auditor, as IT Security Architect, and as teacher Information Security at different business schools and universities. Currently, he works as Senior Security Consultant for Ubizen, where he is also a teacher for Ubizen College. When he is not working, you can find him under water (Scuba Diving), playing computer games, travelling or reading a book."
