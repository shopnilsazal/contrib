title: 'DEF CON 18 - John Curran - IPv6: No Longer Optional'
recordingDate: 1383934918
description: "John Curran - IPv6: No Longer Optional\nThe available pool of IPv4 address space has reached a critical level. With about 7% of the IPv4 free pool remaining, organizations should already be taking steps to prepare for IPv6. There is only about a year before IPv4 is fully depleted, so it is vital that all companies adopt IPv6, the next generation of Internet Protocol, now to avoid growth and scaling issues down the road.\n\nWhile IPv6 will help lead the development and deployment of next-generation, IP-based networks and services, many companies have been slow to adopt IPv6 for various reasons, such as the cost in time and money to move to an IPv6 system, and the need for bridging technology to make IPv4 and IPv6 systems compatible.\n\nIn this session, John Curran, CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN), will describe the key considerations for and benefits of IPv6 adoption and the steps all network operators and engineers should be taking to prepare for IPv4 depletion challenges.\n\nJohn will also review regional and global IPv4 depletion and IPv6 adoption statistics, address allocation trends, and the IPv6 educational resources available to help operators and engineers prepare.\n\nARIN is the nonprofit corporation that manages the distribution of Internet number resources, including IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs), to Canada, many Caribbean and North Atlantic islands, and the United States.\n\nJohn Curran is the President and CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN), responsible for leading the organization in its mission of managing the distribution of Internet number resources in its geographic region. He was also a founder of ARIN and served as its Chairman from inception through early 2009.\n\nJohn's experience in the Internet industry includes serving as CTO and COO for ServerVault, which provides highly secure, fully managed infrastructure solutions for sensitive federal government and commercial applications. Prior to this, he was CTO for XO Communications, and was integral in leading the organization's technical initiatives, network architecture, and design of leading-edge capabilities built into the company's nationwide network. Mr. Curran also served as CTO for BBN/GTE Internetworking, where he was responsible for the organization√≠s strategic technology direction. He led BBN's technical evolution from one of the earliest Internet Service Providers through its growth and eventual acquisition by GTE.\n\nHe has also been an active participant in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), having both co-chaired the IETF Operations and Network Management Area and served as a member of the IPng (IPv6) Directorate.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
