description: "by Daniel Wisnewski\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nHow can we secure IoT and provide for a robust single point of access? XMPPPowered by Tigase can provide an easy touchless setup, a single point ofaccess, and secure access to connected devices.\n\nCurrently the IoT world is a wild west of open devices and insecure access.Given the recent DDoS attack on the eastern seaboard of the US being spawnedby such technology, it may be easy to disregard the IoT as a flash in the pantechnology without much promise. But to do this would be to discount thebenefits the Internet of Things can offer. Using the real time communicationpower and built in security of XMPP, we at Tigase have developed an instantaccess box to serve as a unified device for IoT devices while providing easysetup for your internet connected devices.\n\nConsider a home thermostat that is IoT enabled. Currently, the device itselfis forward facing using some sort of HTTP page, protected by a simple passwordchallenge. To be able to access this device while outside your home network,you will need to leave this device exposed to the greater internet. Yourpublicly available IP now has a front door that can be beaten by brute force.Granted, the worst somebody could do in that situation is inflate your HVACbill for a day until you figure out that 18Â°C is not an appropriate housetemperature. Still, many devices that feature IoT come with very littleunified security built in, and even then may have the most rudimentary ofsecurity built in.\n\nXMPP can provide the solution; a single device to unify, secure, and provideaccess to IoT devices in the home.\n\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 10:45:00"
