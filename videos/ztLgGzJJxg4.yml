title: 'GeeCON Prague 2017: Peter Palaga - srcdeps - source dependencies with Maven and Gradle'
recordingDate: 1516816559
description: 'While the idea of source dependencies is not new -- some languages have it already -- its implementation in the field of Java and its build tools is a novetly. With srcdeps, a Maven or Gradle project can define its dependencies in terms of specific source commits that are built by srcdeps ''on the fly'' when they are requested. Such source dependencies do not need to be present in any remote Maven repository - i.e. they do not need to be released. We will compare srcdeps with Maven SNAPSHOTs and show how they can be useful in testing and integration or for fixing third-party code. In a live demo, we will show how to switch a dependency from a released version to a source revision.'
