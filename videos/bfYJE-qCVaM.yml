description: "Suicide Risk Assessment and Intervention Tactics \nAMBER BALDET INVESTMENT BANKING TECHNOLOGY\n\nSuicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, yet it persists as one of the few remaining taboo topics in modern society. Many characteristics linked to elevated suicide risk are prevalent in the technical community, and the effects of suicide within any community extend far beyond those directly involved. Prevention and intervention, however, are not a mystery. This workshop presents evidence based practices to assess suicide risk in others, and an introduction to the step-by-step practice of crisis intervention.\n\nRather than presenting a \"depressing discussion of depression,\" attendees will learn the same threat modeling and crisis response best practices taught to first responders and mental health professionals, in a condensed format that answers many common questions people may be afraid to ask. Special attention will be paid to risk as it affects our particular community, and an overview of crisis network technical implementations / limitations (effects of digital anonymity & ethical concerns, etc.) will be presented.\n\nMuch like simple CPR training equips everyday people with the knowledge and confidence to help a heart attack victim that is likely a stranger, widespread dissemination of crisis intervention training aims to equip everyday people to prevent a suicide - most often, of a friend.\n\nAmber Baldet (@AmberBaldet) performs product development and systems analysis at a top tier investment bank. Her work involves interesting capital markets applications and mundane info sec policy implementation, neither of which can she talk about. She enjoys teaching kids how to build blinky flashy things and presenting the \"Digital Privacy and the Ethics of Development\" portion of the Girls Who Code curriculum. As part of her volunteer work, Amber was certified as an Online Counseling and Suicide Intervention Specialist by the QPR Institute in 2011.\n\nMaterials: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Baldet/DEFCON-21-Baldet-Suicide-Intervention-Risk-Assessment-Tactics-Updated.pdf \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Baldet/Extras.zip"
