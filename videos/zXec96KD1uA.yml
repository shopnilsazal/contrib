description: "PyData Chicago 2016\n\nGithub: https://github.com/pavanramkumar/pydata-chicago-2016\nAdditional Tutorials: https://pavanramkumar.github.io/pydata-chicago-2016/#1\n\nPyglmnet: https://github.com/pavanramkumar/pyglmnet\nDocumentation http://pavanramkumar.github.io/pyglmnet/\n\nIn the era of big data, and high performance computing, generalized linear models (GLMs) have come to be widely applied across the sciences, economics, business, and finance. Although a popular R package exists, there is no equivalent in Python. I developed pyglmnet to address this need. In this talk, I will give a theoretical overview of GLMs and demonstrate the package with examples."
