description: "The Rails revolution, and Ruby along with it, began in the loud public echosphere of startup companies. The arrival of the Rails framework and the \"Web 2.0\" explosion created a very thunderous effect. Magazine after magazine reported on Rails. All the hip, funded and loud startups were using Rails to build their wares. It became a thing that VCs would assume you were using, and if not, why? The first RailsConf was 90% attended by startups. Rails was a revolution. Since then the loudness has waned. Is the revolution over? Is Rails done? Au contraire, the revolution has gone underground. It's penetrating places that Twitter does not hear. It's building things that are not reported. It's entered the enterprise. This talk will document the rise of Rails and glorious revolution which we barely see, but is happening every day.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GZSr/"
