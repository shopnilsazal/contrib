description: "Droidcon Paris 2014 \nJan Chong, Twitter\n\nIn January 2012, nearly all Twitter for Android code was written by three engineers. As of January 2014, Twitter for Android has several dozens unique contributors from over ten different teams. In this talk, we'll discuss how Twitter moved to develop at scale from a single team-based development model to a project based development model that welcomes contributions from across the company and highlight some of the challenges that we ran into on the way."
