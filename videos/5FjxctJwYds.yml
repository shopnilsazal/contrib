description: 'Are your kids learning how to code? Whatever job they''ll have in the future knowledge of how computers work is going to be an advantage. Several countries have already introduced compulsory computing in schools, but Norway is currently lagging behind. Who gets to decide what is being taught? Should we let tech giants like Google or Facebook do it in after school clubs? If we leave the education to them can we trust them to also teach about corporate mass surveillance? What about civic tech? If the goal is not to produce new workerbees for these institutions but rather create a society of tech savvy rebels who will change the world for the better, what should we do?'
