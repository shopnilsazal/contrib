description: "Prototyping with Paper: How Board Games Become Reality by Mark Simoneau\n\nMuch like developing any feature in your app, the best developers start with an idea and then refine it through rapid testing, much of which requires very few technical skills--but does take focus, observation and patience. In this talk we'll discuss the process of developing and playtesting a board game and what we as software developers can learn from it to improve the features and apps we create. If you like board games or just want to create better experiences for your users, then this talk is for you!"
