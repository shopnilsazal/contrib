description: "Charles Edge: 10 Ways To Not Get Caught Hacking On Your Mac\n\nAbstract: It's hard to prosecute someone if you can't prove what they did. In this session, we will quickly cover 10 easy ways to cover your tracks using Mac OS X. The features of Mac OS X at the GUI level were in a lot of ways designed to cater to the paranoid (eg. Steve Jobs). Underneath the hood, using some easily scriptable techniques you can cover your tracks in such a way that will make it easy to hide what you?ve done as well as your identity. In this session, we will quickly cover some of the techniques that can be used to cover your tracks using case studies that illustrate ways that we have pieced together evidence as a starting point. Using a little bit of forensic evasion can go a long way to keep you free. This might also be interesting for forensic enthusiasts who can learn ways around these techniques. \n\nBio: Charles Edge began his consulting career working with Support Technologies, Andersen Consulting and Honda to name a few.
