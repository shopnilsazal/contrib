description: "Re-inventing the Rosetta Stone Together by Mariko Kosaka\n\nMany tech projects are anglocentric. The de facto language used to develop and document a project is English, and it is often overlooked that a project is used largely by non-English speaking communities.\n\nWe programmers like to think \"code is the universal language,\" but getting to speak code still involves overcoming language barriers. Even after you speak code, your experience working on project involves a lot of cultural references and language use specific to English. So let's pause for a moment talking about the newest features and technical specs, look at the experience of a silent majority, and talk about how we can welcome them to your project today!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HNkQ/"
