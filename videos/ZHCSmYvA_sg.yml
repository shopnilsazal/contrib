description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nPrometheus for Devs - Hubert Ströbitzer, Freelancer (Beginner Skill Level)\n\nHaving Microservices without proper monitoring tools is like driving the freeway without lights at night. One of those proper tools is Prometheus. In this workshop I will discuss/show* the general architecture of Prometheus * how to run Prometheus and Grafana within Docker * how to run some exporters and how to scrape them * how to create a simple Dashboard in Grafana * how to write custom metrics with a Spring Boot Application\n\nAbout Hubert\nHubert is the guy who supports Devs to get into DevOps mode. He is responsible to keep a Microservice stack up and running and therefore uses Docker, Kubernetes and Ansible on a daily basis. Having a strong Java and Spring coding background he tries to fill the gap between Dev and Ops and hopes to become obsolete as soon as possible. Hubert is the founder of the IaaM (Infrastructure as a Meetup - http://iaam.at) in Linz, Austria. He loves going deep into technical concerns and to discuss cultural aspects of our business. Recently he grew a strong affinity for monitoring."
