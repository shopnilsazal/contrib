description: "Anders Lehmann - How to GIS with Python\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nIn this talk I will present some tools for working with Geographic\nInformation Systems in Python.\n\nGeographic information Systems are widely used for managing geographic\n(map) data. As an example I will present how to use Open Street Map\ndata (http://openstreetmap.org/), in routing, traffic planning and\nestimation of pollution emission.\n\nFor the purpose of the project EcoSense (http://ecosense.au.dk), GPS\ndata from users smartphones are mapped to OSM roads. The map matching\nalgorithm is written in Python and uses data from the database\nPostgreSQL, with the PostGIS extension.\n\nOne of the goals of the EcoSense project is to devise methods to\nimprove the estimation of air quality in urban environments."
