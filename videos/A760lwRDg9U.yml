description: "Keynote: Monitoring Kubernetes Clusters with Prometheus - Fabian Reinartz, Software Engineer, CoreOS\n\n\"Kubernetes is a powerful system to build, operate, and grow a Cloud Native architecture. But how can we stay on top of whatâ€™s happening across thousands of pods that are dynamically scheduled across hundreds of nodes?\nIt needs a system capable of monitoring all individual units across the entire stack while enabling users to drill down from a global view to individual instances. Prometheus is an open source monitoring system designed with exactly this goal in mind. As it turned out, Kubernetes and Prometheus is a match made in open source heaven. Fabian will explain common challenges when monitoring large scale infrastructure and how Prometheus provides high-level observability without giving up low-level insight.\"\n\nAbout"
