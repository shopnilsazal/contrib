description: "by Jorge Salamero\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nWhile there have been many improvements around securing containers, there isstill a large gap in monitoring the behavior of containers in production.Thatâ€™s why we created Sysdig Falco, the open source behavioral activitymonitor for containerized environments.\n\nSysdig Falco can detect and alert on anomalous behavior at the application,file, system, and network level. In this session get a deep dive into Falco:\\- How does behavioral security differ from existing security solutions likeimage scanning? \\- How does Falco work? \\- What can it detect? Building andcustomizing rules \\- Next steps\n\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 12:30:00"
