description: "Navigating the Open Seas by Carol Nichols-Goulding\n\nA new language being born is a fairly rare occurrence—a new language being born with the reasoning behind all the decisions documented in the open is even more so. Learn techniques to help you explore the treasures in git, GitHub, Discourse, and IRC. Take a half hour tour through some defining moments in Rust development history—for instance, the core language used to have a garbage collector!\n\nBecome a better Rust user and contributor by using these open artifacts. After all, programming is not about knowing all the answers but knowing how to find the answers.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Gz3d/"
