description: "by Martin Richard\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nasynctest enhances the standard python package unittest with features forasyncio. This talk aims at presenting asynctest and discuss various practicesaround unit testing of code using asyncio.\n\nThis talk aims at presenting asynctest, a library written on top of thestandard unittest module. asynctest provides features for writing tests forlibraries and programs using asyncio.\n\nWe will discover handy features like:\n\n  * how asynctest.TestCase reduces boilerplate and offers safeguards around subtle mistakes in an asynchronous code,  * how asynctest.Mock objects helps to mock coroutines, and how patch decorators are enhanced to handle coroutines,  * how one can control the event loop's clock.\n\nI will also discuss the future of asynctest and planned features.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.120 (Chavanne)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 15:00:00"
