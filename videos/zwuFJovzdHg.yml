description: "At Swarmify, we have been running Clojure/Clojurescript in production since 2013. As we have rapidly scaled in use and complexity, we have learned many lessons about what works, what doesnâ€™t, and what could be improved. When life comes at you fast, Clojure can be your superpower.\n\nNathan is a relentless serial entrepreneur, Internet and video streaming expert who has been featured in Huffington Post, and Forbes. Tries to live in the future, soften the rough edges, and enable it to become the present. Currently growing Swarmify where we provide fail-proof video streaming so that buffering never happens again."
