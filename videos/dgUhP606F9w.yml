description: "Are your controllers jumbled with seemingly unrelated steps? Does testing any bit of application logic require fixtures and setup helpers a mile long?\n\nEvented patterns create a vocabulary of what happens in your system, and a way to separate code triggering events from code that responds to them. That helps tame the sprawl by setting clean boundaries, simplifying tests, and keeping your dependencies isolated.\n\nThis talk reveals the power of events and what's already in Rails to help you.\n\nI fell in love with programming watching my dad work in Clipper and dBase III (no, really). That obsession continues today. My current language crushes are Ruby and Haskell, and I work for New Relic on the Ruby Agent. When not at work, I enjoy cycling, homebrewing, and hanging out with my family.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0R/"
