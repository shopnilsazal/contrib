title: '#HITB2017AMS D2T2 - Bypassing Memory Mitigations Using Data Only Exploitation Techniques - Bing Sun'
recordingDate: 1494974755
description: "As Control Flow Integrity (CFI) enforcement solutions are widely adapted by major applications, traditional memory vulnerability exploitation techniques aiming to hijack the control flow have become increasingly difficult. For example, Microsoft’s Control Flow Guard (CFG) is an effective CFI solution against traditional memory exploits.\n\nHowever, due to the CFG implementation limitations, we have seen new exploitation techniques such as using the unprotected ret instruction to bypass CFG. We believe eventually these limitations could all be overcome or improved, and ultimately we expect a fine-grained CFG solution to completely defeat control-flow hijacking. Consequently, attackers have begun to seek alternatives to exploit memory vulnerabilities without diverting the control flow. As a result of this trend, the data-oriented attacks have emerged.\n\nAs its name suggests, a data-oriented attack focuses on altering or forging the critical data of an application, rather than attempting to alter its control flow. The data-oriented attack may allow the attacker to do some powerful things, such as loading certain unwanted or disabled modules or changing the attributes of certain memory pages. Sometimes this can be achieved by changing only a few bits of data. Today, most successful memory exploits can gain some level of memory read/write primitives during exploitation of memory corruption vulnerability, which makes data-oriented attacks possible.\n\nIn this talk, we will present some interesting examples that show the power of data-oriented attacks. We then discuss ways to prevent such attacks. We conclude by live demonstrations of CFG/DEP bypass on Windows 10’s Edge using data-only exploitation techniques.\n\nThe mitigation bypass techniques that will be discussed in this talk has won Microsoft’s mitigation bypass bounty (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dn425049.aspx), and the details have never been publicly disclosed anywhere.\n\n=== \n\nBing Sun is a senior information security researcher, and now he is leading the IPS security research team of Intel Security Group (formerly McAfee). He has extensive experiences in operating system kernel and information security technique R&D, with especially deep diving in advanced vulnerability exploitation and detection, Rootkits detection, firmware security and virtualization technology. Moreover, Bing is also a regular speaker at international security conference, such as XCon, Black Hat and CanSecWest."
