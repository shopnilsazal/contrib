description: "by Santiago M. Mola\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\n[go-git](https://github.com/src-d/go-git) is a Git library written entirely inGo. It is designed to be developer-friendly and highly extensible. In thistalk we will introduce go-git, the reasons why we created it, its currentdevelopment status and its roadmap. We use go-git to fetch every Gitrepository that has been published (all GitHub, Bitbucket, self-hosted...) andanalyze all source code history and we hope that it can support many other usecases.\n\ngo-git intends to be the way to go for Git with Go and a solid alternative tolibgit2 and jgit. Currently the library has 22k LOC's, has full read-featureparity with libgit2, has a dedicated team committed to it, and is the 3rd mostpopular git implementation. While it's still has a long way to go, we havealready used it to fetch and analyze 17M GitHub repositories, so it has a goodstability level for the feature set that we have implemented so far.Developers who are looking into building software to manipulate repositoriesat low level will find go-git a tool that can boost their productivity.\n\n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 10:15:00"
