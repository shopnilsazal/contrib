title: 'An lot Cloud-Based Architecture for Anesthesia Monitoring - Francesca Stradolini'
recordingDate: 1525246951
description: "Medical Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are already paving the way towards the realization of Smart Hospitals. Following this trend, I want to present an IoT cloud-based network implementation for anesthesia on-line monitoring. This architecture allows the anesthesiologist to remain simultaneously connected to all the patients under his/her responsibility. To do so, an Android app, running on the anesthesiologistâ€™s tablet/smartphone, plays a central role of the architecture. From one side, it receives data from the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) system measuring the infused drugs in the patient's blood; on the other side, it pushes data to the cloud, exploiting the Pryv middleware solution, enabling teleconsulting. By adopting this architecture, the anesthesiologist can monitor multiple patients at the same time and, therefore, follow different surgeries in parallel. In case of any anomaly in measured data, the doctor is also alerted by a notification pushed by the Android app to his/her smartwatch. This ensure a rapid and efficient medical intervention. \nAll the communications exploits Wi-Fi, therefore, all data are also stored locally in the physical devicess memory to face Internet unavailability. \nThe flexibility and the portability of our monitoring architecture ensure the possibility to interface with any medical device (TDM system) which can wirelessly send the measured data. Therefore, a variety of medical monitoring applications can also be addressed."
