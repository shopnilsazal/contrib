description: "Michal Hořejšek - Testing web apps with Selenium\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\n„Selenium automates browser.“ Selenium can be used as tool for testing\nweb applications. At first it can be pretty hard to start testing with\nSelenium, but later on it can be even harder. I want to show you that\nit doesn't have to be true. That it can be easy, actually. But you\nhave to know few things which you have to be careful about and that\nthere is tool webdriverwrapper which can make it easy for you.\n\nI will speak about handling pages with JavaScript and which common\nproblem can you have, how to run Selenium on servers without X server,\nhow to deal with tabs, how to test with UnitTest or pytest, and how\ncan webdriverwrapper make things easier for you and more."
