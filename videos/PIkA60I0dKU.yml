description: "ðŸ’– Support the show by becoming a Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/funfunfunction\n\nToday, Iâ€™m going to show examples of this and bind. In the last episode we explored this and bind. Reading the comments of the last video, itâ€™s clear that some people had an aha moment around this, but for a lot of you it this didnâ€™t click. It really, really important that we understand the concept of this in order to learn the object model in JavaScript, so Iâ€™m going to spend a video on doing a bunch of more examples, so that more people get it. \n\nThis video is part a series on object creation on JavaScript, that is for you if are coming from another programming language into JavaScript and youâ€™re already somewhat familiar with object oriented programming. You know what classes and inheritance is, but youâ€™re confused about how object orientation is done in JavaScript. Youâ€™ll get much more out of this video if you watch  this series from the the start - you can find a link the full series in the episode description. \n\nTable of contents:\n02:19 â–º What is this in JavaScript\n04:16 â–º Bind in JavaScript\n06:29 â–º Functions as properties on objects\n07:00 â–º Functions are values in JavaScript\n\nI'm also active on:\nâ€¢ Twitter https://twitter.com/mpjme\nâ€¢ Medium https://medium.com/@mpjme\nâ€¢ Quora https://www.quora.com/profile/Mattias-Petter-Johansson\n\nResources:\nObject creation in JavaScript - Complete series playlist\nhttps://goo.gl/RaBJDo"
