title: 'Rocky Mountain Ruby 2012 - Let''s talk concurrency by Jose Valim'
recordingDate: 1351059403
description: "For a long time, the de facto way of doing multi-core concurrency was using threads. However, the complexity of manipulating threads and state affected negatively how developers perceive concurrency. Fortunately, languages like Clojure and Erlang implement new paradigms that aim to make concurrency easier.\n\nIn this talk, Jos√© Valim is going to discuss the role state play in concurrency and introduce different paradigms for multi-core concurrency, like Actors and Software Transactional Memory, explaining their trade-offs and why they matter to us developers."
