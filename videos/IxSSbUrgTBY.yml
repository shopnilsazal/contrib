title: 'Ruby Conf 11 - Powerful (but Easy) Data Visualization with the Graph Gem by Aja Hammerly'
recordingDate: 1319146973
description: 'Many projects involve large datasets. While humans are master pattern matchers, trying to find patterns and issues by looking at reams of text is hard. Sometimes you just need the 30,000 foot view but creating diagrams by hand is time consuming and prone to error. The graph gem makes it quick and easy to create visualizations of your data. In this talk, we''ll learn how to use nokogiri and graph to get data out of an XML file and into a format where you can see relationships and patterns. We''ll also see how color coding and clustering can emphasize the patterns in your data. Many of the examples will come from my work with adaptive education apps.'
