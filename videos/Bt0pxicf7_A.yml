description: "Panel: Leveraging the Open Service Broker API in Cloud Native Platforms [I] - Moderated by Chip Childers, Cloud Foundry Foundation\n\nIn a digital world, widely adopted and easy to use APIs are the cornerstone of collaboration and interoperability. As Cloud technologies mature and become commonplace, the absence of standards surfaces challenges in the implementation of solutions by Cloud vendors, service providers and end users. Building on top of the experience of Cloud Foundry's Service Broker API, the Open Service Broker working group brings together players from all areas. The Open Service Broker API is an industry-driven, collaborative effort to demolish barriers in the adoption of Cloud Native services, with a user-centric approach focused on delivering features based exclusively in real world use cases.\n\nIn this panel discussion you hear from representatives from IBM, Pivotal, Fujitsu, RedHat and Orange explaining where they want the project to go and why the initiative is important to them. Expect to learn more about the Open Service Broker API working group, the future of the project and insights into how leading technology companies are applying this specification to real world use cases.\n\nAbout Chip Childers\nA proven DevOps visionary and leader. Before coming to the Foundation, Chip was vice president of Product Strategy at CumuLogic. He spent more than 15 years in engineering leadership positions within the service provider industry including work with SunGard Availability Services and Qwest Solutions. He has served on the board of directors for the Distributed Management Task Force; and is a member of The Apache Software Foundation.\n\nAbout Guillaume Berche\nGuillaume is a software architect at Orange, one of the leading telcom operator in Europe and Africa, where he is contributing to the Cloud Foundry-related Paas programs. He is contributing to Cloud Foundry including through proposals to the open service broker api. He is the product manager for a series of OSS service brokers (*) where he explores and experiments how OSB API can support additional use cases for paas users.\n(*) e.g. autosleep, db-dumper-service, or sec-group-broker-filter\n\nAbout Doug Davis\nDoug works in IBM's Open Source and Standards division. He's been working on Cloud related technologies for many years and has worked on many of the most popular OSS projects, including OpenStack, CloudFoundry, Docker and Kubernetes.\n\nAbout Andres Garcia Garcia\nAndres has covered a wide range of roles including research in Cloud Computing, Software Engineering and Scrum Master. Currently he develops prototypes and PoC in Fujitsu EST, although his latest passion is DevOps and open standards.\n\nAbout Alex Ley\nAlex is a Product Manager for the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform and is focused on enabling multi-cloud services using Cloud Foundry and BOSH. Previously, Alex was a committer to the container engine Garden Linux, used by Cloud Foundry, and worked in London's FinTech startup scene. Alex is also contributing to the Open Service Broker API initiative and is responsible for delivering these new features into Cloud Foundry. You can regularly find Alex talking about Cloud Native technologies and agile working practices at conferences around Europe and the US.\n\nAbout Paul Morie\nPaul is a Principal Engineer at Red Hat and is a committer to the Kubernetes project. He is currently leading the Kubernetes Service Catalog SIG and the champion of the service-catalog Kubernetes incubator repository. Before Kubernetes, he worked on the first three versions of Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform and built multi-tenant platforms for the financial and insurance industries. He likes spending time with his wife, scale model making, and striving for perfect hair.\n\nAbout Diane Mueller-Klingspor\nDiane is Director, Community Development at Red Hat OpenShift (https://openshift.com) , the leading Open Source Paas that upstreams Kubernetes, supports Docker natively and runs on OpenStack (as well as AWS, GCP, Vmware, and bare metal). She also runs the OpenShift Commons (https://commons.openshift.org) and manages the cross-community collaboration with all the upstream projects and across the diverse and ever-expanding OpenShift eco-system. She has been coding and tinkering for over 30 years; and founded @GetMakered Labs to help connect underserved and remote communities to new technology in the Pacfic Northwest. She serves on the board of the SC Maker Faire (http://sunshinecoastminimakerfaire.com/). She was named one of the top 10 Women in Cloud in 2015."
