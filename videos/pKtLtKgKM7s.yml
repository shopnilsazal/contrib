She will also discuss the evolution of the relationship between the computer security researcher community and law enforcement and government.\n\nTwenty years ago, Dead Addict practically begged Gail Thackeray to appear at DEF CON, even though she was actively prosecuting several of his close friends. Since then the government (law enforcement, military, and intelligence community) has actively participated in DEF CON; to the point where we've been given the moniker 'FED CON'. Dead Addict will discuss the evolving relationship between government, the hacker community, and the civil liberties community. While obviously at odds with each other in some areas, there is also shared ground between these groups. This year he was happy to be able invite Gail again, this time not begging as much, and thankfully she isn't prosecuting any of his friends.\n\nFollowing their talk, Gail and Dead Addict will give a special introduction to our Special Guest Speaker [REDACTED], [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].\n\nGail Thackeray is a former Assistant Attorney General and Special Counsel recently retired from the Arizona Attorney General's Office.
