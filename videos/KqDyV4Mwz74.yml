description: "Why would we ever build a distributed computing platform in node?by Gord Tanner\n\nbitHound is a JavaScript shop. We have been working with JavaScript for a few years and have a major appreciation for the power and speed of which we can build in nodeJS. When we set out to start building bitHound, we made sure that we were able to use it to analyze itself to hone the tools.\nJavaScript is a great language but doesn’t come without it’s challenges. We will cover the lessons learned on our path to developing our distributed compute platform.\nSpecific topics that will be covered throughout include:\nBrokerless / brokered messaging\nDesigning for a generic compute note architecture\nLimitations of node and JavaScript for parallel tasks\nUsing non-blocking io to speed up large jobs\nWhen and how to split long running tasks\nHandling failure\nUsing metrics to improve architecture and performance\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GXNk/"
