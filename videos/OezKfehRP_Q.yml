description: "by Fabian Reinartz\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nIn a Cloud Native infrastructure, component failure is normal and expected.The loss of a single node or a dozen hard drives is automatically handled bythe systems running a datacenter, removing the need to page someone at 4am.This calls for an alerting system that understands service availability at aglobal scope, yet is still able to give detailed reports if and when there isa service-impacting incident. Prometheus achieves this by defining alertingconditions directly on time series data. The resulting alerts are grouped andaggregated into comprehensive and meaningful notifications. Fabian will walkthrough the philosophy of time series based alerting, the Prometheusarchitecture behind it, and how practical anomaly detection can beimplemented.\n\nThis talk was previously scheduled for 09:50.\n\n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 11:35:00"
