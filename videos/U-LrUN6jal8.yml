title: 'Rails Conf 2013 Using Elasticsearch with Rails Apps by Brian Gugliemetti'
recordingDate: 1369359417
description: "Elasticsearch is a powerful text search engine that's easy to configure and to integrate into your Rails and Ruby applications. But it's more than just a general text search engine--elasticsearch stores data in JSON format allowing for faceting and complex searches. There are gems that integrate it with ActiveRecord, but it can also be used easily outside of ActiveRecord. Learn from the real-world application of elasticsearch for general text searches to specific catalog-type searches. \n\nWe'll cover the elasticsearch basics, the existing gems you can use to integrate, and the lessons learned from integrating into existing projects. Examples include: how to index existing ActiveRecord models for general text searches, how to use elasticsearch for autocomplete, and how to use for complex queries.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGaE/"
