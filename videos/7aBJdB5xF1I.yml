title: 'Introduction to web application development in Clojure'
recordingDate: 1431328790
description: "This is a talk about Clojure as a tool to develop web applications with leiningen, Compojure and Enlive (you could be using different set of projects, but since most if not all are based on Ring, the knowledge gained on this presentation should be easily applicable to other project sets, too).\n\nDuring the presentation I demonstrate the tools needed to set up a complete environment for web development. Itâ€™s gonna be very easy to follow for people who want to start developing *something* in Clojure. The presentation is used as a vehicle to drive people towards a fictitious but research-oriented project to study functional concepts of Clojure further."
