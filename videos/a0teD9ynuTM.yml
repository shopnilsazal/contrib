description: "Coming from a hacker background, I've continually been surprised by how frequently new grads lacked the skills needed, particularly in community learning. When I was asked to teach Ruby on Rails at Columbia University I observed that a significant number of the skills required to become successful professionals in the industry are acquired on the job and aren't being taught in school.\nThis presentation will review: \n- Lessons learned from the experience teaching in my alma mater's CS program. \n- How I developed a hacker-centric curriculum teaching not only the algorithms, but the keys to being a successful developer in the modern open source driven Rails community. \n- How we as hackers can fix this.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG9S/"
