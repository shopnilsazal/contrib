description: "Stratocaster is an internal GitHub Ruby project written to replace the organically grown GitHub Event timeline. This is a tale of an overgrown MySQL table being replaced by a more specific Redis setup. We'll see what new possibilities that Redis is able to provide. Also, we'll go over how Mustache was able to replace Erb for event rendering.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GZCa/"
