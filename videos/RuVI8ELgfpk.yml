description: "Has \"DevOps\" jumped the shark?\nSome say yes; others say 2014 will be the year DevOps dons its Fonz-esque leather jacket. Whichever you believe, the marketing feeding frenzy has begun and the dilution of the \"DevOps\" concept to include everything (and simultaneously mean nothing) is palpable.\nBut DevOps has a dirty secret: many of its core tenets are ancient computer history: configuration management, version control, automated builds, and metrics-driven decision making: all old news. So what caused these long-known best practices to congeal and pop together, becoming part of the industry consciousness? And why have some been so successful at implementing it in their organizations while others continue to struggle?\nThis talk deconstructs the meta-elements of DevOps that made it resonate so strongly with so many and allowed those familiar DevOps poster children—Netflix, Etsy, and others—to deploy the methodology with such success in their businesses. We'll go beyond DevOps' classical CAMS (culture, automation, metrics, and sharing) definition to discover what exactly what made DevOps relevant, and what about it is so timeless and foundational that it will make whatever-follows-DevOps relevant, too.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2T/"
