Bug bounty programs are becoming well established as a valuable tool in identifying vulnerabilities early. The Department of Defense has authorized its first bug bounty program, and many vendors are taking a fresh look. While the programs are highly effective, many questions remain about how to structure bug bounty programs to address the concerns that vendors and researchers have about controlling bug hunters, security and privacy, contractual issues with bug hunters, what happens if there is a rogue hacker in the crowd, and liability and compliance concerns. This presentation will cover the best practices for structuring effective bug bounty programs.\n\nJim Denaro\nPartner, CipherLaw\nJim is a registered patent attorney in the Washington, D.C. area and advises clients on offensive and defensive applications of intellectual property.
