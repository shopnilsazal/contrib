description: "by Justin Collins, CEO of Brakeman, Inc.\n\nAbstract :\nHow do we dismantle the reign of dangerous and prevalent vulnerabilities? \"Injection\" has crowned the OWASP Top 10 since 2010, while cross-site scripting (a type of injection) has maintained placement in the top four since 2003. If these two vulnerabilities are well-understood, well-documented, and have \"clear\" solutions, why have they remained on the OWASP Top 10 for nearly 15 years? Let's take a step back to examine what causes injection (and XSS) vulnerabilities and potential plans for their dethronement.\n\nJustin has been an application security engineer at SurveyMonkey, Twitter, and AT&T Interactive, and is the primary author of Brakeman, an open source static analysis security tool for Ruby on Rails.\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
