description: "RubyConf 2016 - Becoming a Mid: Two Perspectives on Leveling Up by Kimberly D. Barnes & Kinsey Ann Durham\n\nWhat does becoming a mid-level developer mean? How can a junior set goals and make steps to achieve this? It's difficult to shed the title of 'junior', not only in your own mind, but in the minds of others. It is important to keep progressing in your career as a developer to be able to level up and no longer be seen as the junior on the team. Kim and Kinsey will provide two perspectives to enable you to leave this talk with tangible action items. They will also dive into what employers can do to help build frameworks to allow for this transition."
