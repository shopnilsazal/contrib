description: "By, Sebastian Sogamoso\nLike an espresso, code is better served in small portions. Unfortunately most of the time we build systems consisting of a monolithic application that gets bigger and scarier by the day. Fortunately there are a few ways to solve this problem.\n\nEveryone talks about how good microservices are. At a first glance an architecture of small independently deployable services seems ideal, but it's no free lunch, it comes with some drawbacks.\n\nIn this talk we'll see how microservices help us think differently about writing code and solving problems, and why they are not always the right answer.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/G6rG/"
