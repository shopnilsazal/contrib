description: "We hear a lot about how various different databases and storage methods work at massive scale, but that always comes at a massive engineering and ops cost - and for most companies, that's not what they need anyway.\n\nWe'll take a look at databases with the perspective of a smaller engineering team - from 1 to 100 people - and see how databases not only perform at scale, but also how they perform with rapid development, continuous deployment & smaller hardware requirements, and take a look at what Big Data really means anyway.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nAugust 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
