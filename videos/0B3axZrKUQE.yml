title: 'Pycon UK 2016: Scripting across hosts with Chopsticks'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474200344
description: "Daniel Pope\n\nChopsticks lets your import and run Python code on remote Unix hosts over SSH. It works with no code deployment and no preinstalled software other than Python and SSH. It has built-in support for running code on many hosts in parallel.\n\nUnlike Fabric or Ansible, Chopsticks not opinionated about the structure of the code you run, allowing it to be used for orchestration, auditing, diagnostics, monitoring probes, and more.\n\nAlso unlike these, Chopsticks is not wedded to SSH, so it can transparently work on Docker containers over pipes, local subprocesses - and in future, sudo?\n\nDaniel will demonstrate Chopsticks in action, walk through the API, and explain the three clever tricks that Chopsticks is built on."
