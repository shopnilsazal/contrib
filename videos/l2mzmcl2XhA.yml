Low-tech Ways Of Detecting High-tech Surveillance \nDr. Phil Polstra ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF DIGITAL FORENSICS, BLOOMSBURG UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA \nIs someone spying on you? This talk will present several low-tech ways that you can detect even high-tech surveillance. Topics covered will include: detecting surveillance cameras with your cell phone, signs that you are under physical surveillance, detecting active and passive bugs with low cost devices, and detecting devices implanted inside computers, tablets, and cell phones.\n\nPhil was born at an early age. He cleaned out his savings at age 8 in order to buy a TI99-4A computer for the sum of $450. Two years later he learned 6502 assembly and has been hacking computers and electronics ever since.\n\nDr. Phil currently works as a professor of digital forensics. His research focus over the last few years has been on the use of microcontrollers and small embedded computers for forensics and pentesting. Phil has developed a custom pentesting Linux distro and related hardware to allow an inexpensive army of remote pentesting drones to be built using the BeagleBone Black computer boards. This work is described in detail in Phil's book \"Hacking and Penetration Testing With Low Power Devices\" (Syngress, 2014). Prior to entering academia, Phil held several high level positions at well-known US companies. He holds a couple of the usual certs one might expect for someone in his position.\n\nPhil is also an accomplished aviator with several thousand hours of flight time. He holds 12 ratings including instructor, commerical pilot, mechanic, inspector, and avionics tech. When not working, he likes to spend time with his family, fly, hack electronics, and has been known to build airplanes.\n\ntwitter: @ppolstra \nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ppolstra"
