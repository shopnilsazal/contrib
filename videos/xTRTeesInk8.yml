description: 'Developers are quickly picking up Python for applications ranging from everyday scripting to automate daily tasks, to building highly scalable web applications, to machine learning and data science. In this demo driven session, weâ€™ll show you why we think the cross-platform, free, and open source Visual Studio Code will become your favorite tool for all your Python needs. From editing, to linting, to debugging and more, you will learn how to get started, as well as tips and tricks to save you time in your everyday development lifecycle. You will also learn when to consider Visual Studio 2017, which for certain scenarios (such as mixed C and Python development), can offer you more than any other Python tool on the planet.'
