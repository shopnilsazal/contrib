title: 'DEF CON 11 - Panel - The Luna Correspondence Protocol'
recordingDate: 1392710745
description: "Panel - The Luna Correspondence Protocol\nThe Luna Correspondence Protocol\n\nThe Luna Correspondence Protocol is an anonymous finitely improbable data dispersal and stealth security nexus. Elaborated, Luna is a protocol designed to ensure traffic travelling across the internet can't be snooped by prying eyes. Luna is the greatest and best attempt--to date--at purely anonymous and secure data transmission by commingling various techniques involving encryption, data relaying and mathematics--absolutely not security by obscurity.\n\nBy attending our presentation, the viewer will learn of our comprehensive first-class research conducted in the fields of wide data dispersal, data security and anonymity. The attentitive listner will receive free donuts (Chung's special recipe).\n\nNo esoteric knowledge is required of the listener, only a grasp of networking, as our talk is straight-forward. Data coding and math theory (discrete math) will be discussed, so appropriate knowledge is a plus, but definitely not required.\n\nKeith Hoerling is a pragmatist currently studying at CSUF with a Computer Science major and mathematics minor, ultimately to transfer in pursuit of a doctorates degree. Financially, Keith works part-time in the private sector as a software design and security contractor with over 8 years of professionally solid experience.\n\nDorian Andreatte has worked as a web developer for the last 3 years using PHP, ASP and highlevel programming software. He also currently works as a web application and network systems security tester for various small to mid-size companies. He specializes in network administration as well as database programming.\n\nMark Wilkerson has been involved in computer security and client/server application development for nearly a decade. He has worked as a server administrator and chief security officer of several large CR based communications networks, is a contributing author to several system and network security books, and currently administers several free, public wireless networks in southern Orange County, California. He spends his days begging for change on corners and washes windows for day old donuts.\"\n\nChung San: \"Chung like koi\""
