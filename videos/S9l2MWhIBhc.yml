title: 'The Elements of Kubernetes - Foundational Concepts for Apps Running on Kubernetes'

description: "The Elements of Kubernetes - Foundational Concepts for Apps Running on Kubernetes [I] - Aaron Schlesinger, Microsoft Azure\n\n“The Elements of Style” is one of the most important and foundational guidelines on how to write well. It has effectively summarized, in a list of seminal guidelines, how to harness the power of the English language to write high quality prose of almost any kind.\n\nIn computing, we have similar guides for various technologies. Python offers “The Zen Of Python”, Ruby has “The Rails Doctrine”, and so on...\n\nOne of the powers these documents wield is that they help serve as a “north star” that guides an entire community toward the same goals.\n\nI believe we need a similar guide for Kubernetes. It would describe how app developers and operators should think about and use the features in Kubernetes to build and deploy reliable, stable apps. Armed with such a guide, we could all hope to better understand the “essence” of Kubernetes in pursuit of building better cloud native apps.\n\nWe don’t have anything like this today, but many in the Kubernetes community have strong, detailed opinions for what should go in this guide. Much of it is tribal knowledge or scattered in blog posts. \n\nIn this talk, I’ll try to bring many of these opinions together and lay out an “Elements of Kubernetes” guide for app developers and operators alike. I’ll do so by relating each “element” to stories and details I’ve seen in the community that reveal what makes a good Kubernetes and cloud native app.\n\nAbout Aaron Schlesinger\nSr. Software Engineer on the Microsoft Azure Containers team where he works on Kubernetes and related projects. He’s involved with the Kubernetes project on multiple levels, most prominently as a co-lead in the Kubernetes Service-Catalog SIG. Outside of Kubernetes proper, he’s deeply involved with connecting external services to Kubernetes clusters in a manageable way.\n\nHe’s been a software developer for 10+ years, and most of that time has focused on distributed systems from large scale data warehousing to real time servers. Being a Go developer for the past 4+ years, he has distilled his knowledge of the language into the Go In 5 Minutes screencast. He’s also spoken at many conferences and events about Go and Kubernetes, as well as other technologies in the past."
