description: "by Daniel-Constantin Mierla\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nKamailio is an open source SIP (RFC3261) server that can be used for buildingreal time communications systems for IP telephony, instant messaging orpresence. Seeral years ago it introduced a Lua embedded interpreter to allowmore flexibility in routing calls. Recently, it was extended to allow entireRTC routing logic to be written in Lua. This talk focuses on showing theinsights of implementing the LUA RTC API in Kamailio, tips and tricksdiscovered to make it as fast as the native pre-compiled routing language, andthe benefits it bring to enhance RTC systems and integrate with third partyservices, such as social networking platforms (e.g., sending a Twitter DM on amissed call).\n\nReal time communications has evolved at a fast pace in the last decade. Fromwhat it used to be direct voice calls or testing via classic or mobiletelephony, nowadays everyone connects through a multitude of channels,dedicated messaging systems or other social media channels. Kamailio is anopen source SIP server developed since 2001, with an initial focus onscalability for IP telephony services. To allow more flexibility and easierintegration with other RTC services, an embedded LUA interpreter was added toit and with a recent development, the entire SIP routing logic can be writtenin Lua. The presentation will reveal insights of implementing the LUA RTC APIin Kamailio, tips and tricks discovered to make it as fast as the native pre-compiled routing language, and the benefits it bring to enhance RTC systemsand integrate with third party services, such as social networking platforms(e.g., sending a Twitter DM on a missed call).\n\n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 08:00:00"
