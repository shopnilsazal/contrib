description: "View Jonny's iPython notebook and sample data set here:\nhttp://www.thoughtfultech.co.uk/matrix-completion-for-users-and-items.html\n\nRecommender Systems are now ubiquitous in solving the problem of predicting latent behaviour from customer data. This workshop presents an introduction to this problem using a wide range of Python based libraries. We firstly review the general problem and simple collaborative filtering methods in numpy, before examining Matrix Factorisation using the SVD methods present in scipy and the sparsesvd. We then explore Non-negative Matrix Factorisation and binary problems using the nimfa library. To summarise, we end end with a comparative study on an example data-set, comparing efficacy and accuracy. This tutorial is online at http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/jonn..."
