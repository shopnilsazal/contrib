description: "How do we make sense of a regular sentence, especially when they take us down the \"garden path\"? For example, when we see a sentence that starts with \"The old man,\" most of us would expect the next word to be a verb. So when we read, \"The old man the boat,\" we have to backtrack to re-evaluate what the subject of the sentence really is. Humans are naturally attuned to parsing grammar in natural languages by analyzing the role and meaning of each word in context of its sentence. However, people may find the idea of parsing a computer language intimidating. In this talk, we'll explore the way we normally make sense out of an expression and relate that to the way parsers are used in computer science. By understanding the way we are inherently programmed to parse sentences, we can better understand common parsing strategies and how we can incorporate those tools into our code.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GRsl/"
