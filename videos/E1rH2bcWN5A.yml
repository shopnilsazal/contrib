description: "By Aman King\n\nWill showcase real-world project code, highlighting custom-written Ruby DSLs that contribute to project success by improving team productivity. Ranging from simple authentication rules to complex social networking capabilities, DSLs can help tackle cross-cutting requirements and domain-specific abstractions. Benefits include faster story development, easier bug fixes, and deeper technical exposure for team members. Will also talk about some gotchas.\n\nWill explain multiple techniques for creating DSLs within a Ruby project, including simple OO code without any metaprogramming, to medium-complexity use of mixins, to advanced usage of metaprogramming.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4T/"
