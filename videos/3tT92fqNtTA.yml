recordingDate: 1423775607
description: "By: V. Lee Henson\n\nEveryone has been to an Agile meeting that has little or no value and thatâ€™s felt like a complete waste of time. Facilitation Foundations is designed to offer attendees a chance to learn more about how to make meetings more valuable and save everyone time and money. This talk focuses on what makes meetings work and identifies negative experiences we all encounter when it comes time to attend or facilitate these common meetings. What should we be doing? What should we be avoiding? What could we do to improve the way we facilitate and or attend meetings? How can we make them more effective?"
