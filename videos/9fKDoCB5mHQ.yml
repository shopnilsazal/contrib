description: "Navigating the Container Jungle - Casey Davenport, Tigera\n\nIt's a jungle out there! Modern apps are built around microservices, linked by a complex mesh of connections like sprawling vines. And just like in the jungle there are predators out there waiting to pounce on any weakness, steal your data, hijack your apps, and compromise your users. It may seem like a trade-off: do you simplify networking connectivity OR enforce security? In this session, Casey Davenport reviews the latest developments from the Kubernetes community to enable developers to describe, simply and intuitively, the connectivity requirements of their pods, consistent with established Kubernetes concepts such as labels and selectors. With live demos and examples drawn from user case studies, Casey will navigate the audience through this complex jungle and bring them safely out the other side.\n\nAbout Casey Davenport\nCasey Davenport is a core developer at Tigera working on Project Calico and has worked on software defined networking solutions since 2012. He is an active technology evangelist for containers and simplified networking, and has spoken recently on related topics at multiple meetups. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Northeastern University."
