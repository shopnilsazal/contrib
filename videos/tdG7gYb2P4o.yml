description: "Cloud service providers offer their customers the ability to deploy virtual machines in a multi-tenant environment. These virtual machines are typically connected to the physical network via a virtualized network configuration. This could be as simple as a bridged interface to each virtual machine or as complicated as a virtual switch providing more robust networking features such as VLANs, QoS, and monitoring. At DEF CON 23, we presented how attacks known to be successful on physical switches apply to their virtualized counterparts. Here, we present new results demonstrating successful attacks on more complicated virtual switch configurations such as VLANs. In particular, we demonstrate VLAN hopping, ARP poisoning and Man-in-the-Middle attacks across every major hypervisor platform. We have added more hypervisor environments and virtual switch configurations since our last disclosure, and have included results of attacks originating from the physical network as well as attacks originating in the virtual network.\n\nBios:\nMr.Bull is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Utica College with a focus in computer networking and cybersecurity. He is also a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Clarkson University focusing on Layer 2 network security in virtualized environments. Ronny earned an A.A.S. degree in Computer Networking at Herkimer College in 2006 and completed both a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science at SUNYIT in 2011. He also co-founded and is one of the primary organizers of the Central New York Intercollegiate Hackathon event which brings together cybersecurity students from regional colleges to compete against each other in offensive and defensive cybersecurity activities.\n\nDr. Matthews is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Clarkson University. Her research interests include virtualization, cloud computing, computer security, computer networks and operating systems. Jeanna received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California at Berkeley in 1999. She is currently the co-editor of ACM Operating System Review and a member of the Executive Committee of US-ACM, the U.S. Public Policy Committee of ACM. She is a former chair of the ACM Special Interest Group on Operating Systems (SIGOPS). She has written several popular books including Running Xen: A Hands-On Guide to the Art of Virtualization and Computer Networking: Internet Protocols In Action.\n\nMiss Trumbull is an undergraduate student at Utica College working on her bachelors degree in Computer Science with a concentration in computer and network security. She is also an officer of the Utica College Computer Science club (a.k.a. The UC Compilers). Kaitlin is currently working as an undergraduate research assistant to Professor Bull."
