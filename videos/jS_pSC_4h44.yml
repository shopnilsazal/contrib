recordingDate: 1444406180
description: "Building a Code Sandbox in Docker by Jen Andre\n\nAs developers, we've all see the browser based playgrounds that are useful for demonstration, training and tutorial purposes for various programming languages and frameworks. Often times these are implemented using some fancy emulation of a programming language's interpreter using Javascript, but Jen wanted to see if there was a better way to do this generically.\nIn this talk, Jen will talk about the process of building an open source version of a \"code sandbox\" using Docker and Go called \"codetainer\". Think codepinic.com, but one you can host and modify for your own purposes! She'll discuss some of the benefits and 'gotchas' about using Docker in this way, and some interesting use cases for this technology. Come and play!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HMsU/"
