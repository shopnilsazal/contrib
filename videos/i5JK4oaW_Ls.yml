description: "Computation Expressions are a generalization of do-notation and Idiom Brackets. They provide a single notation that uses the least powerful abstraction in order to translate sugared code into de-sugared code in the most flexible way possible. I will present a project I have been working on to implement computation expressions in Scala. In particular, I will show how this notation helps write asynchronous code with very little cognitive overhead.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HcM0/"
