description: "by Raegan MacDonald\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nAfter nearly a decade, the European Commission has presented its draft law forcopyright reform. And it’s about time: our copyright laws are out of step withtoday’s technology. But the proposal to reform copyright lacks ambition, andis inadequate to address the today’s challenges. It even contains some verydangerous provisions - such as a snippet tax, and upload filters for onlineplatforms - that would put the open internet, innovation, and creativity, atgreat risk. This session will unpack some of the key issues at stake in thereform and how you can get involved. Together we can achieve an EU copyrightreform that fosters innovation and creativity.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 17:30:00"
