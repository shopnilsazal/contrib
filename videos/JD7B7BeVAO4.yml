description: "Michael Rogers - Steganographic Trojans\nSteganographic Trojans\n\nAs anti-virus manufacturers develop more efficient techniques for stopping an infection, potential attackers must become more cunning and resourceful in their deployment methodologies; they must create \"invisible\" code...but how? What are the possibilities of developing an invisible virus or Trojan?\n\nThe purpose of this talk is to explain the research we have collected, and to identify potential distribution methods, including JPEG, MPEG, and MP3, which may utilize steganographic hiding techniques to obfuscate the source code of various programs such as viruses and Trojans.\n\nMichael has been working in the information security field for 4 years and is currently the Senior Security Engineer for Exceptional Software Strategies, Inc, located in Baltimore, Maryland."
