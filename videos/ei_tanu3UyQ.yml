description: "By, Sarah Allen\nI love Ruby, but last year I found myself at the Smithsonian Institution coding in, of all things, PHP & Drupal. And I realized that despite my ambivalence towards those technologies, I had no compelling-enough reason to propose Ruby as an alternative. How did we get to this point? Iâ€™ll tell 3 reasons we didn't use Ruby, and reflect on whether these are things we want, or problems we should solve.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FTes/"
