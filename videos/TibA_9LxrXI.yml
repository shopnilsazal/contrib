recordingDate: 1392712314
description: "Fyodor - Advanced Network Reconnaissance Techniques\nAdvanced Network Reconnaissance Techniques\n\nFyodor will present real-life examples of common network and firewall configurations, then demonstrate practical techniques for exploring and mapping those networks. He will cover IDS evasion, \"phantom ports\", advanced ping sweeps, firewall circumvention, DNS hackery, IPv6, and more using his free Nmap scanner and many other Open Source tools.\n\nFyodor authored the popular Nmap Security Scanner, which was named security tool of the year by Linux Journal, Info World, and the Codetalker Digest. He also maintains the Insecure.Org security resource site and has authored seminal papers detailing techniques for stealth portscanning, remote operating system detection via TCP/IP stack fingerprinting, and the IPID Idle Scan. He is a member of the Honeynet project, a co-author of \"Know Your Enemy: Honeynets\", and a frequent speaker at conferences such as Defcon, CanSecWest, and OSDEM. He can be reached at fyodorinsecure.org or approached as he stumbles out of the Alexis bar most Defcon evenings."
