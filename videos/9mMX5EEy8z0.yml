description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\nFriday, September 19 • 9:30am - 10:15am\n\nThe DevOps of Things\n\nThe DevOps movement is going to celebrate it’s fifth anniversary this October.  I was fortunate enough to attend the inaugural event in Ghent in October 2009. Over the past five years I have been deeply involved with this movement as a practitioner, evangelist and all out junkie.  Although the movement started out as a problem statement to solve developer and operations collaboration, it quickly moved into other disciplines such as security, networking and storage. In this presentation we will take a look at the Devops affect on things like Converged Infrastructure, Software Defined Networking, Software Defined Data Center and of course IPSec.  We will start out with a quick overview covering the past, present and future of Devops.  Then we will end up with a comprehensive roadmap of how Devops is kind of becoming the core of everything happening in IT. \n\nSpeaker\nJohn Willis\nVP of Customer Enablement, Stateless Networks\nJohn Willis is the VP of Customer Enablement for Stateless Networks.
