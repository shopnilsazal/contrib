description: "RailsConf 2018: Access Denied: the missing guide to authorization in Rails by Vladimir Dementyev\n\nRails brings us a lot of useful tools out-of-the-box, but there are missing parts too. For example, for such essential tasks as authorization we are on our own. Even if we choose a trending OSS solution, we still have to care about the way to keep our code maintainable, efficient, and, of course, bug-less. Working on Rails projects, I've noticed some common patterns in designing access systems as well as useful code techniques I'd like to share with you in this talk."
