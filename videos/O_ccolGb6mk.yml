description: "PyData New York City 2017\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/changing-the-world-with-data-combatting-human-trafficking-as-an-example\n\nApplications:\nhttps://github.com/EricSchles/investigator https://github.com/EricSchles/document_search https://github.com/EricSchles/csvconf_talk/tree/master/scraping_craigslist\n\nHow to create change in the world with technology and data science. I'll use my own journey in combatting human trafficking as an example, extracting out themes from these examples. There will be technical demos throughout, showing the gallery of technical solutions I've used to try to solve this social problem. The intention is to show the audience how these solutions generalize. In doing so, the hope is, participants will be able to solve their own social issues."
