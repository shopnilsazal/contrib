description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #11\n7 January 2018\nSponsored by Via, Hosted by Google Campus\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nI've been reading ML and ANN papers for a while now and it seems to me like an entire discipline based on statistical inference has decided to ignore the fact that the question of which model is better is a statistical one. Is a test set precision of 0.834 better than 0.821 in terms of its ability to characterize the model's performance in the real world? Without an estimate of the variance in precision - how can you know? I will explore the possibility of estimating this variance so we can actually pick the approach which is likely to work better.\n\nName's Noah Dolev minus the ark and animals. I am a computational neuroscientist by training. During the day, I work at Wix as a mild-mannered data scientist and statistician but at night I am RunAway Man! I use my dorky powers to escape more virile males by running away quickly!\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
