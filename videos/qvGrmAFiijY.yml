description: "Topic for the talk:\nThe importance of shared meaning of words in effective team and culture building\n\nHave you ever been in a conversation with someone where you both were using the same words, but walked away with entirely different meanings of what was said? In this talk, we'll take a look at the mechanics of dialogue and why having a shared vocabulary does not guarantee a shared meaning between people. We'll also take a look at some stories and practice spotting these tricky meaning differences together, and then look at some examples at how this type of contextual awareness can be used in a deliberate fashion to encourage cultural alignment at work, home, and in life.\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018.
