title: 'Sudeep Das - Using Data Science to Transform OpenTable Into Your Local Dining Expert'
recordingDate: 1418168791
description: "PyData NYC 2014\nI will talk about how we are using data science to help transform OpenTable into a local dining expert who knows you very well, and can help you and others find the best dining experience wherever we travel! This entails a whole slew of tools from natural language processing, recommendation system engineering, sentiment analysis, and predictions based on internal and external signals that have to work in synch to make that magical experience happen. I will touch upon how the rich Python ecosystem of tools like Pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, gensim and matplotlib has helped in almost all stages of this venture."
