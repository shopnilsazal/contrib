description: "Copy of the slides for this talk are here:https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Gavin-Baucom-Smith/DEFCON-20-Gavin-Baucom-Smith-OpenDLP.pdf \n\nPost-Exploitation Nirvana: Launching OpenDLP Agents over Meterpreter Sessions\nR&D Andrew Gavin Security Consultant, Verizon Business\nMichael Baucom Vice President of R&D, N2 Net Security Inc.\nCharles Smith Software Developer, N2 Net Security Inc.\n\nOpenDLP is a free and open source agent-based data discovery tool that works against Microsoft Windows systems using appropriate authentication credentials. However, one drawback to OpenDLP is that its policy-driven approach makes it arduous to scan disjointed systems that are not part of a Windows domain or do not share the same authentication credentials. To fix this, OpenDLP can now launch its agents over Meterpreter sessions using Metasploit RPC without requiring domain credentials.\n\nAndrew Gavin, creator of OpenDLP, is an information security consultant at Verizon Business. He has more than 12 years of experience in security assessments of networks and applications. He has consulted for numerous customers in various industries around the world.\nTwitter: @OpenDLP (project), @andrewgavin (personal)\n\nMichael Baucom is the VP of Engineering at N2 Net Security.
