description: 'Many use Git at the most basic level: push, pull, and maybe branch off to isolate feature and bug fix work. But put together a few new and old effective Git commands and one can really increase productivity. Don''t resort to XKCD #1597 when facing problems. Efficient, transformative personal Git workflows are not only possible, they are easy to learn. This talk will teach you exactly those. Do you want spoilers? Think of the new "git worktree" command, think of "--autosquash", think of "subtree", and of few more interesting surprises in the Git toolchain.'
