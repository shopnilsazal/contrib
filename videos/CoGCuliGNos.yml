description: "PyData D 2016\n\nJupyterLab is an extensible web application (still in alpha) for scientific computation. Users arrange multiple notebooks, editors, terminals, and custom components with tabs, splitters, and sidebars. JupyterLab also has a file browser, command palette and quick help system. We demonstrate JupyterLab and recent developments and show how JupyterLab fits in the vision of the Jupyter project."
