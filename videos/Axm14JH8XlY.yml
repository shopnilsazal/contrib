description: "Romain Guillebert - PyPy and the future of the Python ecosystem\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nPython has a great versatile ecosystem but the competition is getting\nbetter, this talk is about how Python can keep up with these new\nlanguages and where PyPy fits into this.\n\nRecently we've seen the rise of new technologies like Go, Node.js and\nJulia, those have the ability to build an ecosystem on a clean slate\nand thus be better than Python in some aspects. What would it take to\nbe as good as those technologies on those aspects without loosing all\nthe things we love about Python ? This talk will describe my perfect\nfuture where Python keeps getting better, gets to keep it's great set\nof libraries and where PyPy fits in that future."
