description: "Pipe Operator for Ruby by Fabio Akita\n\nElixir is one modern language that is introducing many Rubyists to the world of highly scalable, highly distributed, functional programming-based programming. In a more narrow scope, one language feature that many people liked is the now famous Pipe Operator . There is nothing like this in Ruby. But could there be such an operator? And if it could be done, would it be useful? I started a pet project called Chainable Methods to address just that.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Prkf/"
