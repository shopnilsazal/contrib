description: "Communicating Intent Through Git by Josh Freeman\n\nGit is a distributed version control system for our source code. It provides the technical mechanism to answer the who, what, when, and where of every decision made. However, Git never requires us to answer why.\n\nSoftware is the result of thousands of decisions. Add this feature; clarify this method; change this behavior. Every team should be able to know why a decision was made.\n\nCreating software is a journeyâ€”let Git be your travel journal."
