description: "Q& A with the Men (and Women) in Black\nPriest Moderator\n\nBack at DC9 a brave MIB from the CIA received clearance and volunteered to answer any and all DC attendee's questions with no restrictions as honestly as he could. After that experience it's only taken us 10 years to get several someone's to come back and do it again!\n\nThis will be your chance to meet and ask any question you want of the so called Men (and Women) in Black. Representatives from the NRO, CIA, NSA, DIA, and US Military will field any and all questions you have on any topic you want. However you may not like the answers.\n\nWe promise there will be no extreme renditions, water boarding, assassinations, or mind control unless you really truly deserve it."
