description: "By, Craig Buchek\n\nIdioms are some of the smallest patterns that we use in our programming languages. Learning the idioms of a language helps you more quickly understand commonly used patterns. Over time, some idioms fall out of favor, and new idioms are developed and adopted.\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore a few idioms that are relatively new to the Ruby community. These include:\n\nModule factory\nTag module\nCircuit breaker\nFetch with default block\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FsXT/"
