description: "SDR Panel: Which are the top 3 challenges for free software radio? An interactive session. Let's talk about SDR!\nby Martin Braun, Tom Rondeau, Bastian Bloessl, Francois Quitin and Ben Hilburn\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe state of SDR, and free/open SDR in particular, is interesting. In somecases, SDR research and progress has been declared dead, implying that thereis nothing left to research or develop. Practical usage of SDR tells adifferent story, though, and users of SDR products run into all sorts ofissues every day.\n\nIn this panel, we would like to discuss with the audience what the top issuesare that SDR frameworks need to solve in the near future -- be they technical,legal, political or anything else.\n\nWhat are the top 3 items that the realm of Software Defined Radio needs tofigure out? In this panel, we invite some experts as well as the entireaudience to discuss this question. We shall discuss technical challenges (ifthere are any) as well as legal and political challenges. Does free/opensoftware radio have any different questions to tackle? If we were to attend atechnical conference in the near future, what would be the most mind-blowingthing we could present? Will there be more, competing frameworks goingforward, or will they consolidate? These and many more questions shall be thetopic of this year's SDR panel.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 11:30:00"
