description: "\"but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes\" -- Ben Franklin\n\nIf Ben was a programmer, he probably would have said \"death, taxes, AND BUGS\". How we handle things when something goes wrong can be the difference between an all-nighter and a good night's sleep.\n\nDrawing on my experience development, QA, and release management I'll share ideas for handling the unexpected without losing your mind. I'll discuss writing a good bug report, figuring out what is really broken, and what to do when it seems like nothing is working.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG5o/"
