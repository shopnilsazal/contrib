description: "\"Replacing passwords with multiple factors: email, OTP, and hardware keys\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - Anfiteatro 1]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nPasswords have formed the cornerstone of I.T. system authentication for decades, but recent high-profile breaches have underscored the risks of password-based authentication systems.\n\nThe good news is that we can replace passwords with other factors:\n\nemail-based authentication\none-time passwords (OTP)\nhardware keys (Yubikeys/U2F, etc.)\n\nThese factors can be used independently or in conjunction with one another to provide vastly greater security than the traditional username-plus-password combination.\n\nAttendees of this talk will walk away with a detailed understanding of:\n\n\nwhy the traditional username-plus-password combination is failing us\nwhy email-based authentication provides no less security\noverview of one-time passwords and TOTP\nhow to store/retrieve OTP codes, including password manager support\nstate of hardware keys in general, and FIDO U2F standard in particular\n\n\nAttendees will learn how to implement these multi-factor authentication methods in their own Python-based web applications, with primary focus on methods for integrating email-based authentication, one-time passwords, and U2F hardware keys into Django-based projects.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
