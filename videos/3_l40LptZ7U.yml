description: "Modern Intel CPUs allow using JTAG-like interface through USB 3.0, it available on numerous platforms. These make it possible to control a system totally, making the technology attractive not only for debugging and research. Starting with Skylake, Intel introduced Direct Connect Interface(DCI) technology, and you can find a rather superficial description of it in the docs. Exist  two types of connection: using a specific device, the so-called Intel SVT Closed Chassis Adapter, or a common USB3 Debug cable. Here I would like to note that the target system in this case does not require any software or hardware agents. We will talk about implementation of this technologies and USB3 Hosting DCI protocol.\n\n===\n\nMaxim Goryachy is a system and embedded programmer and security researcher of Positive Technologies. Has talks at conference PHDays and 33C3.\n\n---\n\nMark Ermolov is a system programmer that is interested in security aspects of hardware, firmware, and low-level system software (bare-metal hypervisors, OSes cores, device drivers). He has had talks at Russian security conferences PHDaysIV and ZeroNigths and 33c3 conference"
