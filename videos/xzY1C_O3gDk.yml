description: "Lonestar ElixirConf 2017- The NeverEnding Application by James Gray & Paul Dawson\n\n“Why do you stick everything in a database?” —Joe Armstrong\n\n\nModern application development can be tough. You need to remember things with long term storage, you need short term storage for the times when that’s too slow, and you need another kind of storage just to remember who you are currently talking to. This process is obsolete. \n\nElixir affords us other options in designing our applications. We have ready access to: \nAccumulate only data stores\nBuilt-in caching via `ets`\nHot code reloading\nThese tools make it simpler to spend effort solving problems instead of working to satisfy some request/response cycle. \n\nThrough a sample application, we will explore these techniques and hone our recognition of when it’s possible to bypass complexity with straightforward data flows. \n\nMake your apps run on state instead of CRUD."
