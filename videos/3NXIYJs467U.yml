title: 'Reaktor Breakpoint 2018: Karri-Pekka Laakso, Simple software by avoiding design'
recordingDate: 1529053606
description: "Simple software tends to be easier to use than complex software because it does less things. But supporting new needs typically makes software increasingly complex over time. How can a designer, looking to help the users’ in all ways possible, help slow this growth of complexity?\n\nOne way is to avoid doing design altogether. Instead of designing something fancy, offer less support – or even no UI at all.\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018. For more information, check reaktorbreakpoint.com. \n\n---\n\nKarri-Pekka Laakso\nLead UX Designer, Reaktor\n\nKarri-Pekka Laakso is a lead designer, authority in UX, and passionate developer with expertise in making sure software solves real world problems. He goes barefoot whenever it’s appropriate – and often even if it’s not – and practices backflips and orienteering in his free time."
