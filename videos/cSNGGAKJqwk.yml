description: "By Nicolas Spiegelberg.\r\n\r\nThe engineering team behind Facebook Messages spent the past year building out a robust, scalable infrastructure. We spent a few weeks setting up a test framework to evaluate clusters of MySQL, Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, and a couple of other systems. This talk looks at why we ultimately chose HBase and a number of the infrastructure decisions the team made to handle well over 100 billion messages per month.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
