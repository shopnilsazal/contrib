description: "Google Video tech Talks\nFebruary 27, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis paper evaluates the suitability of the MapReduce model for multi-core and multi-processor systems. MapReduce was created by Google for application development on data-centers with thousands of servers. It allows programmers to write functional-style code that is automatically parallelized and scheduled in a distributed system.\n\nWe describe Phoenix, an implementation of MapReduce for shared-memory systems that includes a programming API and an efficient runtime system. The Phoenix runtime automatically manages thread creation, dynamic task scheduling, data partitioning, and fault tolerance across processor nodes. We study Phoenix with..."
