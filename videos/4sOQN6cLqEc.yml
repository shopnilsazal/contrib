description: "Filmed at PyData London 2017\n\nDescription\nJulia's well-known combination of ease-of-use, performance and powerful features make it uniquely suited to the toughest machine learning problems. We'll illustrate how Julia can accelerate your current workflow, show you the groups running intelligent Julia code in production, and discuss our plans for the future.\n\nAbstract\nExisting machine learning frameworks are complex \"black boxes\" which are designed to work at a certain level of abstraction. If you need higher-level (e.g. complex models) or lower-level (e.g. custom gradients or GPU kernels) control than the framework provides, you get stuck.\n\nJulia's mix of performance and ease of use opens a radical alternative; a single language that can work at all levels, from GPUs to data processing pipelines to clusters. Different approaches can be freely mixed and matched, with transparency and control at all levels of the stack. Come see how these ideas can accelerate your current workflow, and get a glimpse of the future of ML in Julia.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
