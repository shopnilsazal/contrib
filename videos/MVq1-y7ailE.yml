description: "In this 2017 GDC talk, designers Hal Barwood, Chelsea Howe, Luke Muscat, Christina Norman, Richard Rouse III & Damion Schubert showcase five more experienced designers and some of their personal design tricks-of-the-trade. Each speaker has ten minutes to go into detail about their rule and talk about how they've used it on past projects, highlighting where it works well and where it may not be applicable. For each rule, you can then decide whether it's useful for your own projects and how you might merge that technique into your own design rulebook. You may not agree with every rule you hear in this fast-paced and energetic session, but they'll certainly get you thinking about the craft of game design.\n\nRegister for GDC: http://ubm.io/2gk5KTU\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
