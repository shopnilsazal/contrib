title: 'The LHC Computing Challenge: Preparation, Reality, and Future Outlook'
recordingDate: 1290123815
description: "Keynote Address given by Tony Cass of CERN at the 24th Large Installation System Administration Conference (LISA '10).\n\nCERN's IT department, in collaboration with particle physics computing institutes around the world, has been preparing for the arrival of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data since early 2000. Now that the accelerator is in operation—with routine operation at record colliding energies since March—I will report on how the computing infrastructure has stood up to the test of real data, compare today's reality to both recent tests and original predictions, and then risk some predictions about the future evolution of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid."
