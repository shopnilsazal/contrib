description: "Firewatch is a first person game that focuses on narrative while still allowing for exploration and expressive player choices, all without combat, player death or other traditional action/adventure mechanics. In this GDC 2015 talk, Nels Anderson (Mark of the Ninja) and Jake Rodkin (The Walking Dead Season 1) discuss how Firewatch is being designed - especially in its levels - with those objectives in mind. \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
