description: "The Scaladoc page for Option says: \"The most idiomatic way to use a scala.Option instance is to treat it as a collection or monad and use map, flatMap, filter, or foreach [...] A less-idiomatic way to use scala.Option values is via pattern matching.\" In this talk we show how to use the Option monad in an idiomatic, functional style, leveraging its comprehensive set of higher-order functions to solve any coding situation in a concise and declarative manner. After this talk, you will never have to pattern match against Options again!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HbvW/"
