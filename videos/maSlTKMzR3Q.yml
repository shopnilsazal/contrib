description: "You've probably heard of Python, the _other_ popular, dynamic, multi-paradigm programming language. It occupies much of the same space as Ruby, has many similar language features, and the syntax even looks pretty similar. But what are the specific strengths and weaknesses of Python when compared to Ruby? What use cases are conducive to one language versus the other? In this talk, we look at some of the differences in language design, exploring how they affect application development and maintenance. Later, we look at some specific scenarios and show how the strengths of each language apply.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGdM/"
