description: 'Wireless technologies are seeing increased use on the plant floor to enable pervasive monitoring and control of processes. Off-the-shelf security tools focus on assessing the security properties of commercial and consumer protocols such as 802.11 and Bluetooth. Several new standards have emerged for use in industrial environments. In this talk, Blake will offer an introduction to Software Defined Radio (SDR) tools and their application in industrial security assessments. We will review two protocols based on 802.15.4, including industry standard WirelessHART. Blake will cover how to understand the security properties of RF protocols through integration with familiar tools such as Wireshark. The goal is to leave the audience with the knowledge to get started exploring their RF environment with GNU Radio and low-cost SDR tools and to stress the importance of including RF when threat modeling a system or facility.'
