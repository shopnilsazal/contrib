description: "By, Joe Mastey \nUser Centered Design as a process is almost thirty years old now. The philosophy has permeated our products and the way we build our interfaces. But this philosophy is rarely extended to the code we write. We'll take a look at some principles of UX and Interface Design and relate them back to our code. By comparing code that gets it right to code that gets it desperately wrong, we'll learn some principles that we can use to write better, more usable code."
