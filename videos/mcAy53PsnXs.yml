description: "n0namehere, Real World Privacy, How to Leave Less of A Trail in Life\nLike leaving breadcrumbs in the forest, individuals leave a data trail throughout their day. This talk will look at practical ways to leave a smaller data wake. Privacy isn\"t dead. Time, money and effort are needed to maintain and live outside the data collection mechanisms that are now\npart of society.\n\nLevel of privacy achieved\n\nHow easy it is to lose one's privacy...\n\nThis is not a talk to look at the ways in which your data is shared, but a look at examples and methods by which one can minimize sharing the data in the first place. Topics to be covered include communications, money, medical, travel, shopping, rubbish and major life events. The key is to not leave any data, but, when one must leave data, leave it in a way which it won\"t trace back to you.\n\nn0namehere started down the privacy route in the early 1990s after mistakenly hearing cell and cordless phone calls on his recently purchased scanner. Realizing the ease in which others could listen in on his life, this event led to a re-evaluation of his behavior which changed his life. He spreads the word among friends and family, encouraging many down the road to stronger\nprivacy.\n\nn0namehere is a big computer company survivor whose personal and professional work focuses on computer security and privacy issues ranging from running to designing to breaking systems, networks and applications. n0namehere has worked for Fortune 500 companies, consulted on hundreds of system and network designs and worked security/privacy issues during the Summer Olympic Games. n0namehere doesn\"t live in a cave but balances privacy and reality in his daily life."
