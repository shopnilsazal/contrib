description: "Erlang User Conference 2012\n\nerlang-solutions.com\nerlang-factory.com\n\n\"Clojure is the promise of a new dawn of clarity and empowerment. Enjoy the purity of functional programming, the uniformity of a LISP-based syntax and the pragmatic power of high level data structures.\n\nEschew the accidental complexities of overzealous object orientation, misguided attempts at brevity by implicit obscurities, and the conflation of state and identity -- mangling time with imperative side effects.\n\nThis introduction will give you a glimpse into the power of expression, and provide some pointers and advice for wrapping your mind around the shape and intent of these parentheses from a more civilised age, enhanced with the vectors, maps and sets of modern living. You will also be shown how to tame the monsters of state and direct time. \"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
