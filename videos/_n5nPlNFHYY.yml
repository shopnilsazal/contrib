description: "Automating and Testing Production Ready Kubernetes Clusters in the Public Cloud - Ron Lipke, Gannet/USA Today Network\n\nAs a large enterprise organization with legacy infrastructure, we were interested in adopting Kubernetes in our internal Platform as a Service in the public cloud. However, we faced several challenges not addressed by the turn key offerings on the market, such as:\n\n- Maintain control over network architecture within the public cloud to integrate with our internal resource\n- Allow teams to easily spin up kubernetes clusters on their own for faster development cycles while retaining cost boundaries and charge-back insight\n- Quickly iterate as new kubernetes versions are released and make new features available to end-users (most recently: Role Based Access Controls and StatefulSets)\n\nWe will share our experience of using configuration management to automate the testing, building and deployment of production ready cloud agnostic kubernetes clusters to the AWS and Google clouds. We will also discuss examples of moving some of our largest application workloads to these clusters.\n\nAbout Ron Lipke\nSenior Developer, Platform as a Service, Gannet/USA Today Network\nNuclear plant operator turned cloud person"
