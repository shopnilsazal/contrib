description: "Chris Evans, Google Chrome Security Team\nPresented at the 22nd USENIX Security Symposium\n\nThe Chrome Security Team was founded in 2009 and has adopted a different approach and structure to traditional security teams. We hypothesize that some of Chrome Security's successes can be directly attributed to the unconventional approach. We will freely share details in the hope that progressive organizations will be interested in adopting some of the same tactics."
