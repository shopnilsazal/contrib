description: "by Josh Hartung\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThis fall my team launched the Open Source Car Control (OSCC) project, a by-wire control kit that makes autonomous vehicle development accessible andcollaborative to developers at every level. In this presentation, we discussthe project and its implications on the development of autonomous cars in avertically integrated and traditionally closed industry.\n\nA primary barrier to entry in autonomous vehicle development is gaining accessto a car that can be controlled with an off-the-shelf computer. Purchasingfrom an integrator can cost upwards of $100K, and DIY endeavors can result inunreliable and unsafe solutions. The OSCC project acts as a solution to theseproblems. OSCC is a kit of open hardware and software (based on Arduino) thatcan be used to take control of the throttle, brake, and steering in moderncars. The result is a fully by-wire test car that can be built for about $10K(USD), including the vehicle. In this discussion, we unpack the impetus anddevelopment of the OSCC project, challenges we encountered during development,and the role projects like OSCC have in a necessary “flattening” of theautomotive industry.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 10:00:00"
