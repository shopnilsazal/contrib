description: "Go is well-known as a rising star in building infrastructure and networked services. But it also makes an excellent choice for building developer tools that are downloaded and run on diverse, uncontrolled environments around the world. I will briefly cover why Go makes such an excellent choice for creating developer tools, but the talk will focus primarily on how to solve the most common problems unique to these tools. I will cover how to bundle non-code asset files, safely cross-compile release builds, remotely auto-update, gracefully handle crashes and more by drawing on lessons and techniques learned building my own developer tool, ngrok.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0X/"
