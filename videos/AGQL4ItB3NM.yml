title: 'Cloudbursting with Kubernetes - Irfan Ur Rehman & Quinton Hoole, Huawei Technologies'
recordingDate: 1525675400
description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nCloudbursting with Kubernetes - Irfan Ur Rehman & Quinton Hoole, Huawei Technologies (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nCloudbursting is one of the most useful features of cloud computing for applications with high traffic volumes during only some hours in a day, or only during some days in a month. Kubernetes as of release 1.9 supports both application auto-scaling based on metrics such as CPU utilization and cluster node auto-scaling based on application workload (pods) needs. Kubernetes also supports cluster federation, which enables binding of multiple clusters into a single observable unit from the point of view of a user. This presentation will discuss how we’ve used these features to reliably burst from a priority/low cost cloud cluster to another, using Kubernetes. We’ll introduce a possible spec, a reference design, discuss the missing pieces and a provide a demo.\n\nAbout Quinton: \nQuinton is currently Technical Vice President of Cloud Computing at Huawei. Previously he spend five years at Google, where he was an Engineering Lead on the Kubernetes team, and Technical Lead and Manager of Ads Serving SRE. He was also the founding engineer of the Amazon EC2 cloud computing project (2005-2009) where he lead much of the early design, implementation and operation. As a lead engineer at Nimbula (a startup that was sold to Oracle in 2012), lead the design and development of their Cloud IAAS product (both private and public cloud). His experience prior to EC2 includes telecommunications (call center switches, CTI systems, mobile billing systems), financial (data exchanges, point-of-sale systems), travel (internet booking systems, airline and hotel reservation systems) and mobile (aviation GPS navigation, banking etc). Quinton is also part of the 15 member kubernetes steering committee.\n\nAbout Irfan\nIrfan is a senior engineer with Huawei Technologies and is currently associated with the cloud platforms team. In his current role he is part of the engineering group that works as a bridge between the kubernetes open source project and Huawei's adaptation of the same in its cloud paas platform. His previous experience involves leading part of the linux based OS platform development consumed internally by huawei products, being part of linux benchmarking and multiple sw development projects with Motorola and Hewlett Peckard. He has previously spoken at multiple open source conferences, including linuxcon and opensourcecon."
