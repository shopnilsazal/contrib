More enterprises are losing ground to hackers, who are able to outmaneuver static and runtime solutions by constantly changing their attack strategies. The team that uncovered iOS malicious profiles, WiFiGate, HTTP Request Hijacking, No iOS Zone and Invisible Profiles are taking it upon themselves to coach developers and organizations on how to regain control, and turn the tables on the hackers behind next-generation mobile malware. \n\n\nIn his presentation, Yair will discuss cutting-edge techniques used by malware writers to circumvent mobile security paradigms such as app-sandboxing and containers. Mr. Amit will then break down the current set of techniques (signatures, static analysis & dynamic analysis) used to identify malware on mobile devices, and identify the pros and cons of these approaches. He will also explain why attackers constantly succeed in fooling these technologies, and explore the problem of false positive/false negative tradeoffs in such solutions. \n\nDuring a live, interactive demo, Yair will create a mobile malware on stage, meant to be undetected by static and runtime analysis technologies.\n\nYair Amit\nCTO & Founder, Skycure\nYair Amit is co-founder and CTO at Skycure, leading the companyâ€™s research and vision and overseeing its R&D center. Yair has been active in the security industry for more than a decade with his research regularly covered by media outlets and presented in security conferences around the world. Prior to co-founding Skycure, Yair managed the Application Security and Research Group at IBM, joining through the acquisition of Watchfire. \n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
