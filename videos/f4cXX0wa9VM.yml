title: 'Pycon UK 2016: Symbolic Computation with Python using SymPy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1475190698
description: "Sartaj Singh\n\nThis workshop aims to introduce attendees to SymPy, a computer aided algebra system (CAS) written in Python. We will show basics of constructing and manipulating mathematical expressions in SymPy, the most common issues and differences from other computer algebra systems, and how to deal with them.\n\nAttendees will take home an introductory level understanding of SymPy. This knowledge should be enough for attendees to start using SymPy for solving mathematical problems and hacking SymPy's internals (though hacking core modules may require additional expertise)."
