title: 'Stay: How To Thrive and Survive As a GameDev'
recordingDate: 1530267714
description: "Five years is what they give us - five years to live the dream many of us chased since we were children, five years to make the magic we first discovered in arcades, on the Apple II, on the earliest game consoles. Five years to get in, get excited, get shipped, get tired, get laid off and get out. Five years. While much has been said about the reasons we come and we go, not nearly enough has been said about the reasons to stay. Across the industry, there are people with 10, 20, 30 and even 40 years experience for whom game dev has become a way of life, a passionate calling that leaves us more energised than empty. What can we learn from them? In this talk, Brenda Romero explores the reasons we stay.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
