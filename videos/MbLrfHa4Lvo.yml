title: 'Benchmarking AppSec Across Industries - Chris Eng - AppSec California 2016'
recordingDate: 1458611895
description: "Every industry faces the challenge of securing software, so why do some industries “get it” while others\_struggle to manage the problem at scale?\_\n\nIn this session, we will share data drawn from over 200,000 application assessments performed via\_Veracode’s cloud platform over an 18-month period. This is the largest data set of its kind, and it\_provides unique insight into the state of software security. Attendees can use this information to\_benchmark their AppSec program against peers, answering key questions such as:\n  Do I have more serious vulnerabilities than my peers?\n  What percentage of vulnerabilities do my peers remediate?\_\n  How many of our applications should pass the OWASP Top 10 when initially assessed?\n  What are the most common vulnerabilities in our vertical?\n  How do coding vulnerabilities manifest across different programming languages?\n\nChris Eng\nVeracode\nChris Eng has over 15 years of application security experience. As Vice President of Research at\_Veracode, he leads the team responsible for integrating security expertise into Veracode’s technology. \_Throughout his career, he has led projects breaking, building, and defending web applications and\_commercial software for some of the world’s largest companies.\n\nChris is a frequent speaker at premier industry conferences, such as BlackHat, RSA, OWASP, and\_CanSecWest, where he has presented on a diverse range of application security topics, including\_cryptographic attacks, agile security, mobile application security, and security metrics. Chris holds a B.S.\_in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of California.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
