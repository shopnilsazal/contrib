description: "Want to take a stab at graffiti but spray paint fumes get you nauseous? Worry not! The world of virtual graffiti is slowly but surely gaining popularity and now hackers with little to no artistic inclination are able to go out and alter digital media as well as leave messages in virtual mediums with as much (if not more) finesse than our analogue counterparts\nare able to.\n\nThis talk will cover the history of graffiti, how virtual graffiti is different from digital graffiti, examples of virtual graffiti that you can attempt on your own, and the legal implications involved with virtual graffiti. There will also be materials provided for LED throwies.\n\nTottenkoph Tottenkoph spends her days completing experiments in exchange for delicious cake, killing hordes of zombies in South Africa, battling terrorists in the streets of Las Vegas, and protecting the planet from the Covenant\n\nTwitter: @tottenkoph\nEmail: tottenkoph@gmail.com\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
