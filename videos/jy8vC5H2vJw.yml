description: "Your VP of Product decides that you need to add a new, awesome critical piece of business logic to the thousands of lines of code that already make up your codebase. You worked hard, add it, built a new version, and uploaded it to the Play Store. The only thing that’s left, is to wait while all your millions of users will update it.\nHoping that it won’t take too long.\nWhat if I told you that you could “”outsource”” your critical business code to your server, deploy immediately and still have the ability to run your application, even if you are offline, and do this with almost the same performance as if this was the native code.\nSound too good to be true?\nSo come and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes."
