title: 'Zookeepr: Home-grown conference management software - Ms. Brianna Laugher'
recordingDate: 1314022356
description: 'Zookeepr [http://zookeepr.org/] is a comprehensive web-based conference management system, written in Python and built on Pylons. It has an unusual development history: custom created for the annual Linux.conf.au conference, there are yearly spikes in event-focused feature development, but relatively little of the ongoing development typically seen in open source projects.'
