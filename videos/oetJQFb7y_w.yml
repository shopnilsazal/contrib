description: 'The Internet of Things is about data, not things: Some forecasts that by 2018 the number of connect things will exceed the combined number of personal computers, smartphones, and tablets.  Each ’thing’ can produce a tremendous stream of data from sensors and other sources.   This presentation will discuss progress, examples, challenges, and opportunities with machine learning for the IoT.  A short presentation will be done on some recent applications of ML (using H2O) to the domains of machine prognostics / health management (PHM) and agriculture.'
