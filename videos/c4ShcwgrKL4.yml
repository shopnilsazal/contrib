description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nConvergence of Serverless APIs & Compute - Sarah Allen, Google (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nServerless has different meanings to different communities — serverless APIs allow developers to build apps that don’t have servers, whether they be Web or native mobile using cloud APIs or serverless compute that offers ways for developers to build zero-ops distributed systems. This isn’t one word with two divergent meanings, but different approaches that are converging. Sarah will share real-world production use cases that illustrate how developers are using these technologies together.\n\nAbout Sarah\nSarah Allen created early web platforms that were serverless before the term was coined — on the original Shockwave team, she created ways for developers to create apps when the web was young. Later, she did server-ful platforms like Flash video and open source developer tools, at OpenLaszlo and 18F. For the past year, she has worked at the intersection of Firebase and Google Cloud Platform, leading teams developing serverless events for Cloud Functions and an open source cloud policy language.
