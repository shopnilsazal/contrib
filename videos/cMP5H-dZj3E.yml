description: "This week, James is joined by friend of the show Charles Wang, Automation Software Engineer at Microsoft, who talks to us about the importance of testing mobile applications. We focus on user interface automation with Xamarin.UITest to build out a full test suite for mobile apps all in C# from Visual Studio and Xamarin Studio for both iOS and Android. Charles builds out a full set of tests and covers best practices before sending the test up to the Xamarin Test Cloud to test the app on thousands of physical devices. \n\nShow Links:\n\nXamarin Test Cloud: https://www.xamarin.com/test-cloud\nGetting Started with Xamarin.UITest: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/uitest/\nXamarin Evolve mobile app source code: https://github.com/xamarinhq/app-evolve\n\nFind James on Twitter: http://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno \nGitHub: http://github.com/jamesmontemagno\nBlog: https://montemagno.com\nand his weekly development podcast Merge Conflict: http://www.mergeconflict.fm\n\nNever Miss an Episode: https://twitter.com/thexamarinshow\nFollow @TheXamarinShow\n\nUseful Links:\n\nXamarin Developer Center & Blog: https://developer.xamarin.com/\nXamarin and Azure: https://www.xamarin.com/azure\nMobile DevOps: https://www.xamarin.com/mobile-devops\nXamarin University Self-Guided: https://university.xamarin.com/self-guided\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree"
