description: "Parsing expression grammars (PEG) are a declarative alternative to the traditional generative approach of context-free grammars (CFG) and regular expressions. They require no tokenization phase, and are usually simpler to understand and maintain. We'll be discussing the Citrus and Treetop Ruby gems and the role of PEG's versus CFG's and regular expressions when parsing and interpreting data. You should come away with an understanding of what a PEG is, how to make one, and how to test and use it to build combined parsers and interpreters for your Ruby programs.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GXlT/"
