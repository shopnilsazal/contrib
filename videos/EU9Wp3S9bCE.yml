title: 'Oana Platon: Inside Service Fabric Health Manager'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526325921
description: "Oana Platon is a Principal Software Engineer - and employee number 10 - on the Service Fabric team. She wrote the first version of the replicator you learned about in Sumukh's awesome deep dive. She holds a degree in Computer Science from the Politehnica University of Bucharest (Universitatea Politehnica din Bucure»ôti). \n\nFor the past few years, Oana has been working on the Health Manager, a critical system service inside Service Fabric's Management subsystem. \n\nHealth Manager enables health monitoring of applications, services, and cluster entities. Cluster entities (such as nodes, service partitions, and replicas) can report health information, which is then aggregated into the centralized health store. This health information provides an overall point-in-time health snapshot of the services and nodes distributed across multiple nodes in the cluster, enabling you to take any needed corrective actions. Health query APIs enable you to query the health events reported to the health subsystem. The health query APIs return the raw health data stored in the health store or the aggregated, interpreted health data for a specific cluster entity.\n\nHow does the Health Manager work? When a cluster is determined to be in an unhealthy state, what happens? How is health management exposed to developers? What are some of the areas that Oana and team are working on to evolve Service Fabric health management, analysis and evaluation? \n\n\nTune in. Meet Oana.\n\n\nHealth Manager source code: https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric/tree/master/src/prod/src/Management/healthmanager\n\nLearn more about Service Fabric health management: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-health-introduction\n\nService Fabric Subsystem Explorer: https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric/blob/master/docs/architecture\n\nTweet to @Carmine007 and @deepkkapur with ideas and feedback."
