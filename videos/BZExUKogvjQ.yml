description: "Roland Gesthuizen\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/203/view_talk\nSchools face a daunting challenge to increase their student\r\nexposure to coding, hands-on technology learning to solve some\r\nreal-world problems and teaching STEM principles (Science, Technology,\r\nEngineering and Mathematics) through design, construction and testing.\r\nThis personal presentation by a leading teacher illustrate journey to\r\nconnect his students to some real-world problems and the challenges\r\nfaced along the way. Following on from an earlier\r\ncomputational-thinking challenge to build and program a moving\r\nvehicle, Roland's current mission is to challenge students to design,\r\nbuild a smart city consisting of intelligent vehicles and\r\ninfrastructure. To do this they need to program a navigation algorithm\r\nto autonomously navigate vehicles through a series of traffic\r\nchallenges that test collision avoidance and road safety. They have\r\nbeen invited to showcase their work at the ITS2016 Word Congress in\r\nMelbourne with a maker-space for delegates to share our hands-on\r\nproblem solving and learning with the software and models developed by\r\nthe students. Moonshots live in a grey area between audacious\r\ntechnology and pure science fiction. Our moonshot was to empower\r\nstudents around the globe to build and control their future."
