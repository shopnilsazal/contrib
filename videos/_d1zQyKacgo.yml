description: "By Ivan Porto Carrero\r\n\r\nThis talk will be about leveraging IronRuby from Mono and moonlight. Depending on the time I'd like to show how you can use IronRuby to easily extend your current GTK, WinForms,.. apps with scripting capabilities.\r\n\r\nPerhaps how you can use IronRuby from Asp.NET MVC. If there is still time left I'd like to show you can script the browser and use Moonlight + IronRuby to use ruby as client scriping language instead or in cooperation with JavaScript.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
