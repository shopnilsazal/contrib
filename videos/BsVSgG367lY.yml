recordingDate: 1323723500
description: 'Maybe, Ruby 1.9.3 will have been released at the time of RubyConf2011. In this talk, I will introduce the news about this latest release. This is not a language features, but a implementation features. I will also introduce other developing features which can not implement on 1.9.3 in time. Moreover, I will introduce our research activities such as real-time profiler, pragmatic compilers and our approach to introduce parallel execution into Ruby - MVM.'
