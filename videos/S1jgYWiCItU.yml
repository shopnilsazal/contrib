description: "By, Liz Rush & Hsing-Hui Hsu \nIn this end-to-end discussion about the challenges with civic data, from no-documentation & incomplete government code to figuring out how to scale data-driven SOA, we'll show you how two Ruby newbies managed to create an awesomely useful parking app in just four weeks.
