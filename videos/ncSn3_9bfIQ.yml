description: "Kubernetes-Defined Monitoring [I] - Gianluca Borello, Sysdig\n\nOver the past few years we’ve all learned how Kubernetes can dramatically change the process of deploying an application, improve reliability, and accelerate operations. As Kubernetes matures, I believe it will have ripple effects on other elements of DevOps, including monitoring. \n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the question, “What if Kubernetes also defined and automated monitoring?” We’ll explore some of the available tooling to answer questions like:\n\n*What are the right ways to instrument Kubernetes minons & pods?\n*How do you effectively get visibility into aggregate microservices vs just containers?\n*How can Kubernetes automate the act of setting up monitoring dashboards and alerts?\n*How can teams use Kubernetes to allow them to isolate monitoring data more effectively, so that the right data is exposed only to the right people?\n\nThis will be a demo-driven session, based on a real Kubernetes environment, using a variety of tools at our disposal. Attendees should have a basic understanding of Kubernetes deployments as well as monitoring requirements.\n\nAbout Gianluca Borello\nGianluca is an engineering manager at Sysdig, where he wears many hats. He's a core developer of sysdig, an open source troubleshooting tool for Linux and containers, and spends his days dealing with backend development, performance analysis and cloud infrastructure management.\n\nPrior to Sysdig, he was an engineer at Riverbed and CACE Technologies, the company behind Wireshark. He's passionate about Linux, open source technologies and distributed systems at scale. He holds a MS in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Torino, Italy. Gianluca has presented sysdig to the DevOps audience at many events including KubeCon, Docker meetups, Sharkfest 2014 and the Facebook Engineering Tech Talk."
