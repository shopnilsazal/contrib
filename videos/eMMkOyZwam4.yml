title: 'A Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Cloud Native Stack by M.-Leander Reimer'

description: "Cloud native applications are popular these days. They promise superior reliability and almost arbitrary scalability. They follow three key principles: they are built and composed as microservices. They are packaged and distributed in containers. The containers are executed dynamically in the cloud. But which technology is best to build this kind of application? This talk will be your guidebook.\n\nIn this hands-on session, we will briefly introduce the core concepts and some key technologies of the cloud native stack and then show how to build, package, compose and orchestrate a cloud native microservice application on top of a cluster operating system such as Kubernetes. To make this session even more entertaining we will be using off-the-shelf MIDI controllers to visualize the concepts and to remote control a Kubernetes cluster."
