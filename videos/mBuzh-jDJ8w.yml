Are all those alarm conditions real? The Completion Backward Principle covers issues arising from Internet-enabled monitoring of burglar alarm systems, and possible mitigations. Spot The Fed will most assuredly be played at this talk.\n\nFor the past seventeen years, geoffrey has been a Facility Security Officer and ComSec manager in support of various tla's. Securing computer networks, telephone systems, and buildings is not just an adventure, it's his job. He can often be found giggling, like a schoolgirl, at the thought of global warfare being waged upon nouns. geoffrey is also available for childrens' parties."
