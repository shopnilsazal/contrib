description: "Timmy's personal sweet-spot of hacking is found where multiple passions of mine collide. He is going to cover his happy place of hacking and will include all aspects of the Ruby on Ales Lifestyle: Ruby, Beer, and the pursuit of Snow through them both.\n\nHe will discuss finding a niche where your passions combine, discovering a need for a business/service, and going for it. All the while finding a way to give back to OSS and your community.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGgf/"
