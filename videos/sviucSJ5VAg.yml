recordingDate: 1400525460
description: "By Tim Miller\nOpenStack networking supports several pluggable backends. Perhaps the most flexible and intriguing of these is the OpenVSwitch plugin, which is built atop the OpenFlow protocol.\n\nThis talk describes the low-level details of the OpenFlow protocol, how it is implemented in both the software OpenVSwitch and in off-the-shelf physical switches, and how it is used by OpenStack Neutron to provide such features as tenant-isolated networks and overlapping subnets.\n\nAdditionally, an OpenFlow sandbox development environment will be demonstrated, which provides a simple way to begin getting one's hands dirty this exciting technology.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0M/"
