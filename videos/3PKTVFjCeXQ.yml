description: "How to be a Corporate Open Source Citizen by Casey West\n\nIt's generally considered a good thing when companies open source their software. They're giving back to the community and being good citizens. Unfortunately it's not always the case that companies are good actors in our community. Sometimes they are bad actors, with practices including deceptive promises of open participation and exploiting free labor in the form of community contributions.\n\nThis talk explores patterns in company-sponsored open source projects, actions which influence the acceptability of those projects by the open source community, and opportunities for companies to participate wholeheartedly in the open source community. Let's talk about the patterns demonstrated by good corporate open source citizens."
