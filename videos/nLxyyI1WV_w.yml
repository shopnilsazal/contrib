description: "Building a Cluster Management API using Kubicorn [A] - Robert Bailey, Google & Kris Nova, Heptio\n\nKris Nova (Heptio) and Robert Bailey (Google) join forces and begin the difficult task of looking into the future of the infrastructure layer of Kubernetes. We start the talk with a brief summary of the state of infrastructure today and explain the differences between “infrastructure as code” and “infrastructure as software”. We look at how the lack of definition in the most fundamental layer of the stack has fragmented our community and caused problems with adoption of Kubernetes. \n\nWe propose a new way of representing infrastructure (the cluster API) for the Kubernetes community and take a deep dive into its implementation in kubicorn. We look at the structure of the cluster API and share valuable insight on how we took lessons from other areas of Kubernetes to form what it is today. Furthermore we look at the power of having a declarative approach to infrastructure as we start to treat the infrastructure layer the same as the application layer.\n\nThe audience will walk away with a clear understanding of the infrastructure layer, as well as a new way of thinking about the infrastructure in the future via the cluster API.\n\nAbout Robert Bailey\nRobert is a lead for the cluster lifecycle SIG and has been working on Kubernetes for more than 3 years. He was one of the founding members of the Google Container Engine team. Prior to Kubernetes, he was a Site Reliability Engineer helping teams at Google launch new products and services.\n\nAbout Kris Nova\nKris Nova is an Advocacy Boss for Heptio with an emphasis in containers and the Linux operating system. She lives and breathes open source. She believes in advocating for the best interest of the software, and keeping the design process open and honest. She is a backend infrastructure engineer, with roots in Linux, and C. She has a deep technical background in the Go programming language, and has authored many successful tools in Go. She is a Kubernetes maintainer, and the creator of kubicorn, a successful Kubernetes infrastructure management tool. She organizes a special interest group in Kubernetes, and is a leader in the community. Kris understands the grievances with running cloud native infrastructure via a distributed cloud native application, and is authoring an O'Reilly book on the topic called Cloud Native Infrastructure."
