description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Christina Lee, Pinterest.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-16\n\nA core part of any app is the ability to know at any given time the set of conditions that make up its current operations. As developers, we need to know this for a variety of reasons, including because knowing this tells us whether we should be queuing any changes and gives us the ability to return the user to their current experience should the application display be interrupted. But despite it’s crucial nature, codifying the state of an application at any given point in time can often be messy and error prone work. In this talk, we’ll look at the reasons representing state can be problematic, and some practical ways to make it better.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
