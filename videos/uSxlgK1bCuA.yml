description: "Kubernetes Storage Lingo 101 - Saad Ali, Google (Beginner Skill Level)\n\nIf you&rsquo;ve wanted to understand what the Kubernetes volume subsystem offers, you will quickly be inundated with buzzwords like Flex Volumes, CSI, in-tree, out-of-tree, Persistent Volumes, Local Volumes, Storage Classes, drivers, plugins, volumes, dynamic provisioning, and more. It&rsquo;s difficult to wrap your head around unless you&rsquo;ve been emerged in the lingo. In this talk I will unravel the state of the Kubernetes Storage landscape in 2018, and, in the process, explain what all of this means and how how it fits together.\n\n\"About Saad\nSaad Ali is a senior software engineer at Google where he works on the open-source Kubernetes project. He joined the project in December 2014, and has led the development of the Kubernetes storage and volume subsystem. He serves as a lead of the Kubernetes Storage SIG, and is co-author and maintainer of the Container Storage Interface initiative. Prior to Google, he worked at Microsoft where he led the development of the IMAP protocol for Outlook.com.\"\n\nWant to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)."
