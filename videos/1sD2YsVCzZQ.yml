description: "Description from DEF CON 9 Speakerâ€™s Page: \n\nAn open-source, international, attenuated computer virus\n\nThe unchecked proliferation of global information networks has left society vulnerable to a digital Armageddon. Computer viruses can counter this vulnerability by stabilizing and strengthening information systems.  Using analogies from medicine, this paper demonstrates the pressing need for well-designed computer viruses.  This paper also proposes the design, implementation, and distribution of an open-source, international, attenuated computer virus.\n\nDr. Cyrus Peikari is the Chief Technology Officer of VirusMD Corporation.  He is the author of \"Windows Internet Security: Privacy and Protection.\" being released this fall from Prentice-Hall publishers. He is a former teacher of advanced mathematics at the Southern Methodist University Learning Enhancement Center in Dallas, TX.   In addition, Dr. Peikari speaks on the radio about Internet Security every Friday night as a correspondent for CBS affiliate A.M 1080 KRLD in Dallas, TX"
