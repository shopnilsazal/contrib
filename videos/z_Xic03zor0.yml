description: "CTF contests are designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing machines, as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world. Reverse-engineering, network sniffing, protocol analysis, system administration, programming, and cryptanalysis are all skills which are generally refined and tested through CTFs. Facebook has recently launched a new open-source Capture the Flag platform, a standalone CTF site that can be used by anyone. Come learn more about the platform, how Facebook uses CTFs, and get a sneak preview of the platform that will be used for the Hack in the Box Singapore GSEC CTF this August!\n\n======\n\nPaul is a Research Scientist at Facebook, where he makes sure software bugs are caught early. He previously spent a good amount of time in academia, where he focused on building unconventional testing tools by integrating testing and verification techniques like symbolic execution, fuzzing and fault injection."
