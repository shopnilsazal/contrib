description: "PayPal Beacon is a small piece of custom hardware powered by Go. I'll discuss the design and implementation, including:\n\n* A simple, custom network stack that integrates with net/http cross-compilation and portability\n* Using composition to maintain sanity in an unreliable operating environment\n* This will be an intermediate level talk. It assumes comfort with Go; experts may be mildly bored\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1X/"
