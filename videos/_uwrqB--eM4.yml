title: 'Simon Willison: Datasette and Datasette Publish'
language: English
recordingDate: 1527494006
description: "Zeit Now makes deploying application logic easy, but leaves mutable persistent data stores to other vendors. This makes it an excellent fit for publishing static datasets. Datasette allows any data that can be represented as a SQLite database to be deployed to the cloud as a browseable interface and JSON API. It makes publishing data as easy as publishing static HTML, and opens up powerful opportunities for rapid prototyping against real-world data. Datasette Publish goes a step further, using the Zeit API to allow users to upload CSVs and create their own Datasette deployments without leaving their web browsers.\n\nSimon will talk about how he built Datasette and Datasette Publish and make the case for building software that deploys other software using the unique capabilities of Zeitâ€™s API 2.0.\"\n\n\nYou can read more about our products and mission here: https://zeit.co"
