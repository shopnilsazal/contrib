It will cover\nimplementation, challenges and further steps. The project is still a\nwork in progress and the code is [available on GitHub][1]. It was\ninspired by the [Over-the-Air Audio Identification talk][2] at FOSDEM\n2016.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/notexactlyawe/abracadabra\n[2]: https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/audio_identification/\n\n-----\n\nThe talk will go over the journey of implementing a Shazam-style sound\nrecogniser using DSP techniques and some fantastic libraries. It will\ncover implementation, challenges and further steps. The project is\nstill a work in progress at the time of proposal and the code is\n[available on GitHub][1]. It was inspired by the [Over-the-Air Audio\nIdentification talk][2] at FOSDEM 2016.\n\nThe basic structure of the project consists a classifier that\nfingerprints audio and stores it in a searchable form and a recogniser\nthat fingerprints a smaller chunk of audio and then searches the\nstored records to find the most suitable fit for it. The recogniser\nwill be exposed as an API to allow for different front-ends.\n\nI will aim to introduce both the field of DSP and concepts behind\napplications like Shazam in a simple easy-to-understand manner. The\naudience will not need any prior experience in anything except Python.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/notexactlyawe/abracadabra\n[2]: https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/audio_identification/"
