description: "Register to Lambda Days newsletter to receive updates: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2018/#contact\n\nMichał Płachta\nPolyglot software engineer specialised in developing distributed applications. Functional programming enthusiast. Loves the human component in software projects. Drinks a lot of tea. Has a blog at michalplachta.com. He currently works as team leader at Ocado Technology, where he is building actor-based software for automated warehouse.\n\nFreestyle, Free & Tagless: separation of concerns on steroids\n\nYou will learn how to cut your applications into isolated pieces. The talk is based on a multiplayer, purely functional version of Prisoner’s Dillema.\n\nOur programs consist of business logic, communication, persistence & logging. We want to keep them apart and reason about each of them separately. Enter free monad. I will show you an application which uses pure DSLs & side-effecting interpreters. Then I will introduce Freestyle library and compare the free monad style to free applicative and tagless final."
