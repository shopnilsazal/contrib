description: "Panel, Ask EFF: Discussion and Q/A on the State of Digital Liberties\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is one of the premiere digital liberties organizations in the world. We fight for freedom of expression on the Internet, the right for researchers and consumers to reverse-engineer their devices, expansion of the public domain, and electronic privacy and anonymity. On this panel, three representatives of EFF will discuss the latest developments in digital liberties, including free speech on the Internet, copyright infringement lawsuits, and electronic surveillance laws under the USA-PATRIOT Act. Audience participation and discussion are part of the deal. Come with your legal and policy questions this is your chance to ask EFF!\n\nAnnalee Newitz (www.techsploitation.com) is EFF's Policy Analyst. She talks to the media, conducts research, and writes policy recommendations and white papers. Although she is a digital rights generalist, her special areas of interest are expanding the public domain, free speech, and network regulation. Previously, she was Culture Editor at the San Francisco Bay Guardian, and was the recipient of a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship in 2002. She writes a syndicated column called Techsploitation and is published regularly in Wired, Security Focus and Salon. In her off-hours, she edits an indie magazine called Other (www.othermag.org). She has a Ph.D. in English and American Studies from UC Berkeley.\n\nWendy Seltzer is a Staff Attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, specializing in intellectual property and free speech issues. As a Fellow with Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, Wendy founded and leads the Chilling Effects Clearinghouse, helping Internet users to understand their rights in response to cease-and-desist threats. Prior to joining EFF, Wendy taught Internet Law as an Adjunct Professor at St. John's University School of Law and practiced intellectual property and technology litigation with Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel in New York. Wendy speaks frequently on copyright, trademark, open source, and the public interest online. She has an A.B. from Harvard College and J.D. from Harvard Law School, and occasionally takes a break from legal code to program in Perl.\n\nKevin Bankston, an attorney specializing in free speech and privacy law, is the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Equal Justice Works/Bruce J. Ennis Fellow for 2003-05. Before joining EFF, Kevin was the Justice William J. Brennan First Amendment Fellow for the American Civil Liberties Union in New York City. At the ACLU, Kevin litigated Internet-related free speech cases, including First Amendment challenges to both the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (Edelman v. N2H2, Inc.) and a federal statute regulating Internet speech in public libraries (American Library Association v. U.S.). Kevin received his J.D. in 2001 from the University of Southern California Law Center, and spent his undergraduate years at the University of Texas in Austin. Kevin's fellowship at the EFF is sponsored by Equal Justice Works Fellowships and the Bruce J. Ennis Foundation.\n\nSeth Schoen created the position of EFF Staff Technologist, helping other technologists understand the civil liberties implications of their work, EFF staff better understand the underlying technology related to EFF's legal work, and the public understand what the technology products they use really do. Schoen comes to EFF from Linuxcare, where he worked for two years as a senior consultant. While at Linuxcare, Schoen helped create the Linuxcare Bootable Business Card CD-ROM. Prior to Linuxcare, Schoen worked at AtreNet, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Toronto Dominion Bank.
