description: "Teaching AI To Make Decisions and Communicate:\nMany advances have been made in the area of artificial intelligence, with the goal of building agents that understand how they can interact with their environments, reason and solve complex tasks, and communicate their findings to humans. In this talk, I will focus on efficient decision-making and communication. For decision-making, I will present some work on building an efficient representation of the environment and breaking down tasks into generalizable subtasks. For communication, I will focus on dialogue through natural language and present some of our work in this area."
