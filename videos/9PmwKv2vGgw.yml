description: "Presentation Title Air Travel Hacking: Understanding and (Ab)Using the Global Distribution System\nPresentation Abstract\n\nIn the recent years air travel has become a commodity and generally cheaper thanks to good acess to booking engines over the internet. This presentation introduces the attendees to basics of air travel booking systems. The main part is spent on showing shortcomings of the online systems. A more direct access to the booking systems thanks to the Internet allows to search for programming errors and mistakes alike which can be abused for cheaper or better travel.\n\nNumerous problem sources in the Global Distribution Systems (which are the backbone of air travel bookings) are outlined and a few ways to exploit these are shown, namely the 'fuel dump' concept which effectivly removes some of the surcharges which make up a major part of the ticket price. Attendees will gain enough insights to start searching for their own 'error fares' and get involved in the fare searching community.\n\nAbout Hendrik Scholz\n\nHendrik Scholz is a VoIP guy. He developed and managed one of the largest VoIP installations in Europe and frequently spoke on VoIP security on various conferences. In the last years he worked on VoIP standardization and quality management for a small Hamburg, Germany based startup.\n\nIn his spare time Hendrik is part in various frequent flyer communities, travels around the world and digs deep into the Global Distribution Systems (GDS) and Computer Reservation Systems (CRS) which are the basis for all our air travel bookings."
