description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nSecure Pods - Tim Allclair, Google (Advanced Skill Level)\n\nWhat is a \"secure pod\"? What does it mean for a Kubernetes workload to have strong isolation? With the announcement of Kata Containers and the overflowing multitenancy deep-dive at the last Kubecon, it's clear that these topics are building momentum. This talk will cover the current state of container isolation and why there is a need for technologies like hypervisor-based containers in order to provide stronger security boundaries. It will also include a discussion of how these technologies fit into Kubernetes and a roadmap for secure pods. This is a rapidly evolving area, and Tim anticipates that a proposal for secure pods will be finalized by May. This talk will be shaped by the status or outcome of that proposal.\n\n\"About Tim\nTim Allclair joined the Kubernetes project with Google just after the 1.0 launch in 2015. He is a sig-auth lead, an active sig-node contributor, and a maintainer of features including advanced audit logging, AppArmor support, PodSecurityPolicy and cAdvisor. He is a member of the Kubernetes Product Security Team (responsible for responding to vulnerabilities in Kubernetes), and a member of the Kata Containers Architecture Committee. His most recent charter is providing stronger container isolation, a topic in which he led discussions at the sig-node & sig-multitenancy deep-dives at Kubecon North America 2017.\""
