description: "Insecure Containers? Continuous Defense Against Open Source Exploits [A] - Andrew Martin, UK Home Office\n\nOpen Source Software underpins the internet and many enterprises, but has repeatedly proven itself vulnerable to accident and tampering. High impact exploits lead us to question our unreserved trust in Open Source, and the wisdom of its proliferation is being questioned. As we fight to continuously secure millions of servers against these waves of attacks, have we found a crucial panacea in containers?\n\nThis talk examines the anatomy of major vulnerabilities, demonstrates their applicability to containerised applications, and explores container native security tooling throughout the pipeline.\n\nAbout Andrew Martin\nAndrew is a DevOps Lead in the UK Government with a strong test-first engineering background gained developing and deploying high volume web applications. Proficient in application development, and Unix systems architecture and maintenance, he is comfortable profiling and securing every tier of a bare metal or virtualized web stack, and has battle-hardened experience delivering containerised solutions to enterprise clients."
