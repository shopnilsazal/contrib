title: 'LA Ruby Conference 2013 Where is my scalable API? by Juan Pablo Genovese'
recordingDate: 1365918799
description: "You have a good ol' Rails application that provides an API. That app is gaining momentum and getting tons of new users every day. You need to double the servers to accommodate the infrastructure to the demand. Then, you get the bill from your cloud service provider and... THE HORROR!! Is big enough to make you cry. Well, here comes Goliath. A very tiny, well designed and FAST non-blocking IO server that will put a big smile in your face, since you're going to need much less money to serve the same (or more!) requests per second. A real case scenario, a social gaming application for mobile devices, will serve as guide to show you how good it is and how much progress can you make with just a little bit of work. From development tools and gems to deployment strategies, balancing and more, we'll show you how a resource consuming Rails API turns into a nimble and fast Goliath API. The real time Internet is calling, and Goliath will hurry to make you more real time than ever.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGdL/"
