description: "Amir Rajan\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/dotnetfringe/sdkttk/\nOne of the best ways to grow as a developer is to learn a new language. It&#39;s truly amazing how your development skills improve once you understand the benefits a language brings to the table...and how it changes they way you code across the board. Ruby has taught developers how to think dynamically about code. With this new perspective, Amir pushed the DLR (dynamic language runtime) to the limits and brought what was learned from Ruby back, leveraging C#&#39;s awesome mult-paradigm capabilities. Amir will show how to think dynamically in C# and how to apply design patterns learned from Ruby."
