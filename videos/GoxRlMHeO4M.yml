description: "Sensepost, When the Tables Turn\nWhen the Tables Turn\n\nUntil now network security defences have largely been about building walls and fences around the network. This talk revolves around spiking those walls and electrifying those fences! During this talk we will highlight techniques (and tools) that can be used to turn the tables on prospective attackers with passive-Strike-Back. We will explore the possibilities across the assesment spectrum responding to the standard assesment phases of Intelligence gathering, Reconnaissance and Attack with Disinformation, Misdirection, Camouflage, Obfuscation and Proportional Response.\n\nRoelof Temmingh is the technical director of SensePost where his primary function is that of external penetration specialist.
