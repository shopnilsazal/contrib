Jim will have on his panel representatives from:\n\n* Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DoD)\n* The Internal Revenue Service (IRS - always a favorite)\n* General Accounting Office (GAO)\n* US Postal Service\n* Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\n* National Security Agency (NSA) (2) \n\nIf you don't want to confess yourself, you can certainly drop a dime on one of the other DEF CON attendees."
