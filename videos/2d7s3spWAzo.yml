But promises are more powerful than callbacks because they compose - you can combine promises and chain them, all kinds of cool stuff - I've showed you some in this video, but there is WAY more you'll be able to do when you get comfortable with promises.\n\nFull code example from the video here:\nhttps://github.com/mpj/fpjs8\n\nMuch inspiration for this episode was drawn from this fantastic guide y mattdesl:\nhttps://github.com/mattdesl/promise-cookbook#the-problem"
