description: "\"A Documentation Talk\" sounds pretty boring, right? Wouldn't it be scandalously titillating if this talk's title included detailed analysis of the expectations and results of the talk itself? Jeez it's like someone's making an overt metaphor for how Rubyists document their code.\n\nAt GitHub, we add docs to every single method we write, and we couldn't be more excited about it. It means faster and simpler code. It means stronger tests. It means your developers can pay attention to new commits without stressing about them. Documentation will make your project so very happy.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GZC5/"
