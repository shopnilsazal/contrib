description: "Meet some of the folks behind Azure's Service Fabric technology, an advanced distributed systems infrastructure that powers many of Azure's core services. \n\nDeep (such a great name!) leads Charles (he's alive!) around the hallways and some of the \"pods\" housing the team. This is unedited and unscripted, of course.\n\nOver time, you will meet more of the engineers behind the technology, with more focused conversations. These will still be in the Old School C9 style and we'll go deep (and sometimes with Deep). \n\nTune in and stay tuned.\n\nLinks:\n\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/dfZ7ZAy11Fk\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/qR4ERyihXoA\nPart 4: https://youtu.be/F1aq5bRJvDU\nLearn more: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/\nSource Code: https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric"
