description: "Let's talk about hardware: The POWER of open. How Open POWER is changing the game and why the Free Software Community should care.\nby Georg Greve\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nClouds are spreading and software is eating the world. But software depends onhardware. If that hardware is not trustworthy, open and secure, the software'strustworthiness, openness and security is for naught. The Free Softwarecommunity has been forced to live with this conundrum for lack of goodalternatives. Too pervasive and omnipresent was the Intel defined x86architecture, throttling innovation, while sequestering security and controlfrom its users.\n\nMost of the discussion in our community centred around damage control andpreventing being locked out from the platform for good. We focused our effortson protecting our ability to use our own software. Positively shaping thefuture, driving the direction, and solving the problem of trustworthy hardwarefor good and at scale seemed impossible.\n\nBut, the thing is, without (almost) anybody noticing, all of the above haschanged.\n\nGeorg Greve, CEO of [Kolab Systems](https://kolabsystems.com \"Kolab SystemsHome Page\"), will talk about the journey [Kolab](https://www.kolab.org \"KolabHome Page\") took to discover OpenPOWER, what we found in the [OpenPOWERFoundation](https://openpowerfoundation.org \"OpenPOWER Foundation\"), and whatit all means for Free Software.\n\nIn this session you will learn how far we have come in our quest to run a datacentre for High Performance Computing on a complete open hardware and softwareplatform, a platform that, at the same time, far outperforms Intel. We willalso cover the TALOS secure work station and what it brings to our community.\n\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 10:00:00"
