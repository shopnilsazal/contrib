Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nSecuring your Kubernetes Delivery Pipelines with Notary and TUF - Liam White & Michael Hough, IBM (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nAs the cloud native ecosystem matures, the focus shifts more towards security. One of the key challenges in this area for enterprises is ensuring that you trust the code that's running in your production environment and that it hasn't been tampered with by malicious third parties. In this session, you'll learn about how Notary addresses this problem, how to get started with Notary and your image registry, and how you can use Kubernetes admission controllers to verify your images against Notary.\n\nAbout Liam\nLiam is part of the IBM Cloud Container Registry team and a core contributor to Istio. He works on the registry and its Notary integration and is currently leading the migration of the registry service onto Kubernetes and Istio. He is an advocate of open source technology both utilising and contributing to multiple projects.\n\nAbout Michael\nMichael works on the IBM Cloud Container Registry team. He has worked on code from the Docker Registry open source project, and is now focusing on integrating Notary with the Container Registry service. He has presented and led labs about Kubernetes and IBM Cloud Container Service at IBM conferences."
