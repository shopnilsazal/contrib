description: "Amelia Bedelia Learns to Code by Kylie Stradley\n\n\"Did you really think you could make changes to the database by editing the schema file? Who are you, Amelia Bedelia?\"\n\nThe silly mistakes we all made when first learning Rails may be funny to us now, but we should remember how we felt at the time. New developers don't always realize senior developers were once beginners too and may assume they are the first and last developer to mix up when to use the rails and rake commands.\n\nThis talk, presented in a storybook style, will be a lighthearted examination of some of the common mistakes (and causes of those mistakes) made by beginner Rails developers."
