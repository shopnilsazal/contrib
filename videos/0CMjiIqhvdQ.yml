description: "\"The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.\" â€\" Jeff Hammerbacher http://buswk.co/eCdfFp We can rewrite Jeff's quote like this: \"The best programmers of my generation are working on solutions to problems that do not matter.\" The crux of it is you are better than your job. You have a greater potential than your job is realizing. You can do more than you think. You are worth more than your job is paying you. You can make the world a better place. You don't have to be limited to building mobile/geo-based/social/ad-driven/gamification-influence/fully-buzzword-compliant bullshit to get people to buy things they don't need while giving up more privacy to corporations and becoming less happy in the process. You're better than that. Quit your job. Build your dreams. Change the world. Srsly.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGkr/"
