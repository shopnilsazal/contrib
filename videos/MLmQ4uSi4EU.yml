description: "Measuring End-to-End Security Engineering\n\nThis talk will introduce a new approach to SDL. At Twilio we call it End to End Security Engineering. It’s End-to-End because it covers the full product lifecycle, from Security Design to Monitoring and gives the ability to measure the state of security at each point.\n\n \n\nThe approach defines a ‘perfect secure system’ and produces metrics which tell us where we are relative to that perfect system.\n\n \n\nThe final state of the product’s security and risk depends on ‘collective understanding’ of threats and attacks as well as investments in building controls, tests and detections. Then we measure and adjust them to improve their effectiveness.\n\n \n\nA perfect secure system is one for which:\n\n- All products and features are threat modeled\n\n- All possible attacks are identified\n\n- All attacks are being monitored for\n\n- All attacks are protected with controls\n\n- All controls are covered with tests which check validity of implementation\n\n- All controls are shown to be effective\n\n \n\nTo measure this we keep track of the following metrics:\n\n- % of threat modeled products/features\n\n- experience of threat modelers\n\n- % of attacks being monitored\n\n- % of attacks with implemented controls\n\n- % of controls covered by full tests\n\n- # of successful attacks\n\n- # of prevented attacks after control has been put in place\n\n\nSpeakers\n\n\nDavit Baghdasaryan\nPrincipal Security Engineer, Twilio, Inc\nDavit is a Principal Security Engineer at Twilio focusing on Product Security.
