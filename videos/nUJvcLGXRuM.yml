description: "I will discuss current research on the MapGraph platform. MapGraph is a new and disruptive technology for ultra-fast processing of large graphs on commodity many-core hardware. On a single GPU you can analyze the bitcoin transaction graph in .35 seconds. With MapGraph on 64 NVIDIA K20 GPUs, you can traverse a scale-free graph of 4.3 billion directed edges in .13 seconds for a throughput of 32 Billion Traversed Edges Per Second (32 GTEPS). I will explain why GPUs are an interesting option for data intensive applications, how we map graphs onto many-core processors, and what the future looks like for the MapGraph platform.\n\nMapGraph provides a familiar vertex-centric abstraction, but its GPU acceleration is 100s of times faster than main memory CPU-only technologies and up to 100,000 times faster than graph technologies based on MapReduce or key-value stores such as HBase, Titan, and Accumulo.
