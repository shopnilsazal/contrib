title: '#droidconDE 2015: Marc Prengemann â€“ The power of custom lint checks'
recordingDate: 1433763598
description: "Find more information here: http://15.droidcon.de/session/power-custom-lint-checks\n\nNearly every Android developer knows about the Lint toolset which comes bundled with the Android SDK - however not many use it to its full power, if at all. Lint can help prevent wrong usage of the SDK APIs, and enforce not only code style, but also internal architecture conventions. For example, you have a fancy BaseFragment which should be extended by all your Fragments, or you have a custom logger which should be used instead of android.util.Log. Both of these are perfect use cases for custom Lint checks.\n\nThis session will show you how to use the APIs to create custom Lint checks, and how to include them in your Gradle-based project.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/winterdroid/the-power-of-custom-lint-checks"
