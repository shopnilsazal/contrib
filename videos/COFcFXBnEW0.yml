description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Alexander Gherschon, Houzz.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-45\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/alexgherschon/kotlinify-your-gradle\n\nThe Gradle build tool is based on the JVM, so where does Kotlin fit in that ecosystem? We will see how Kotlin finds its place in that world, would it be by extending Gradle or by using Gradle Plugins with Kotlin.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
