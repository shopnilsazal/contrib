description: "Many of us want participate in pure and all white project where every single technical decision is in our complete control. Yeah… what a beautiful dream. Despite our strong desire we usually end up with terribly written, barely documented, badly designed and critically loaded applications which cannot be re-written or re-factored due to catastrophic lack of time. Too well known situation, huh?\n\nI have a decent experience with such projects and often after some work can be proud because the application receives a new life and a customer/product owner saves some budget. However, only few have the same passion for “deadly sick” projects so I would like to share the knowledge, how-to’s and recipes of handling those fragile but stubborn folks – legacy projects."
