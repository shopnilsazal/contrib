description: "Self-Hosted Kubernetes: How and Why [I] - Diego Pontoriero, CoreOS\n\nHow Kubernetes is deployed and managed has changed since the first release of the project. From configuration management systems and unit files to deploying Kubernetes using Kubernetes, a lot has changed. Self-hosted Kubernetes has many benefits as a deployment option, and this talk will highlight those benefits, as well as explain the history and nuances of making self-hosted Kubernetes possible.\n\nIn this talk I will describe what self-hosted Kubernetes means, why it exists, how it came into existence, and what you need to know if you're running a self-hosted cluster. Many tools now deploy self-hosted clusters including bootkube and kubeadm, so knowledge of how this works can be very important for anybody running a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nWhat are the benefits of self-hosting? How does it work? What do I need to know if I'm administering a self-hosted cluster? \n\nAll those questions and more will be discussed in detail in this talk. In addition, I will discuss how various projects and products take advantage of the many benefits of self-hosting, such as Tectonic.\n\nAbout Diego Pontoriero\nDiego Pontoriero is a Software Engineer on the Tectonic team at CoreOS, where he works on software that deploys, manages, and upgrades self-hosted Kubernetes clusters. Prior to CoreOS Diego worked at Google building a video-based learning platform, a mobile phone carrier, and a petabyte-scale data warehouse."
