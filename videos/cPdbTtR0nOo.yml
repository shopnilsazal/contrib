description: "In this 2018 GDC session, Nintendo's Kosuke Yabuki  talk about the challenges of creating ARMS, a genre-bending fighting game for a brand-new platform. What lessons can a kart-racer offer a brawler that has players throwing corkscrew punches like tennis players volleying missiles? How do you ensure function follows form, using the Nintendo Switch system's motion controls in ways that feel as natural and responsive as tapping buttons? And what's the story behind a world where protagonists' fists come unglued from their forearms anyway?\n\nRegister for GDC: http://ubm.io/2gk5KTU\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
