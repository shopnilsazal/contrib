Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\ncontainerd Intro – Stephen Day, Docker (Any Skill Level)\n\nContainerd is the core container runtime originally used in Docker to execute containers and distribute images. It was designed from the ground up to support the OCI image and runtime specifications. The design of containerd is carefully crafted to fit the use cases of modern container orchestrators like Kubernetes and Swarm. In this talk, we'll provide an introduction to containerd and how you can get started with leveraging it in your infrastructure.\n\nAbout Stephen\nStephen Day is a software engineer at Docker. His many contributions to Docker ecosystem projects include SwarmKit and the version 2 specification for the Docker Registry HTTP API, and evolving the available models for container image distribution. He currently works on containerd and as a maintainer of the OCI Image Specification."
