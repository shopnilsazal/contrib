description: 'SQL is the winning language of Big Data. Whether you’re running a classic relational database, a column store (“NewSQL”), or a non-relational storage system (“NoSQL”), a powerful, declarative, SQL-based query language makes the difference. The SQL standard has evolved drastically in the past decades, and so have its commercial and open source implementations. In this fast-paced talk, we’re going to look at very peculiar and interesting data problems and how we can solve them with SQL. We’ll explore common table expressions, hierarchical SQL, table-valued functions, lateral joins, row value expressions, window functions, and advanced data types, such as XML and JSON. And we’ll look at Oracle’s mysterious MODEL and MATCH_RECOGNIZE clauses, devices whose mystery is only exceeded by their power. Most importantly, however, we’re going to learn that everyone can write advanced SQL. Once you learn the basics in these tricks, you’re going to love SQL even more.'
