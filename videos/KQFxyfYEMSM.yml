description: "DevOpsDays Chicago 2016 - Building resilience in our organizations, our teams, and ourselves by Rebecca Miller-Webster\n\nWe talk about redundancy and security when it comes to our infrastructure and applications, but we rarely think about creating those same things in our teams and ourselves.\n\nFrom the start-up financial roller coaster to a teammate's marriage (or divorce) to our own personal issues, success, scaling, and our future depend on complex and often chaotic factors.\n\nIn order to succeed, we need to create resilience, not just in our technology, but also in our organizations, our teams, and ourselves."
