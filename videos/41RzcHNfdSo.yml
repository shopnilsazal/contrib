description: "Marco Buttu - Lessons learned about testing and TDD\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nOne day our software will go in production, and so shortly we will pay\ndearly for our youthful mistakes. Without regression tests, we will be\nin deep trouble. If we have regression tests, but we did not have\nperformed TDD, we should probably increase the effort in bug fixing\nand\nmaintenance, since we do not have enough code coverage and our tests\ncome out complex.\n\nBy retracing the author youthful mistakes, we will see a complete\ndevelopment workflow, from the user story to the low-level tests, in\norder to highlight the differences between functional, integration and\nunit tests, the best practices, and the lessons learned by the author\nduring the development of the [Sardinia Radio Telescope][1]  control\nsoftware.\n\n[Slides available here][2].\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCL_tSMqsRg\n[2]: http://marco-buttu.github.io/pycon_testing/"
