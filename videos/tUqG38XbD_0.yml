description: "DEF CON 16 - Joe \"Kingpin\" Grand & Zoz: BSODomizer\nWe like hardware and we like messing with people. BSODomizer lets us do both. BSODomizer is a small propeller-based electronic device that interfaces between a VGA output device (laptop or desktop) and VGA monitor and will flash images at random time intervals. (Surprise Goatse!) Or display your favorite BSOD causing the confused user to turn off their machine over and over again. Customization for different modes are configurable via on-board DIP switches.\n\nWe'll bring you through the entire design and development process of the device and end with some never-before-seen footage of poor bastards taking the bait. Full schematics, firmware, circuit board layout, and bill of materials will be released, so you can build your own BSODomizer. We'll have some bare PCB's and parts available for your instant gratification.\n\nDon't let the name fool you. BSODomizer will do everything you've always wanted to do to your enemies (or friends) without the messy cleanup.\n\nJoe \"Kingpin\" Grand Kingpin is an electrical engineer, hardware hacker, and former member of L0pht Heavy Industries. Even with his distrust of big business, he has become a co-host of an upcoming engineering build show, Prototype This, for Discovery Channel. Sometimes he uses his real name, Joe Grand, and invents things for his company, Grand Idea Studio (www.grandideastudio.com). He's also the sole proprietor of Kingpin Empire, a hacker-inspired merchandise outfit (www.kingpinempire.com) that gives back to the community through charitable donations. He's designed the badge for DEFCON a few times, too.\n\nZoz is a robotics engineer, software hacker, pyrochemist and inveterate tinkerer. He got his PhD from the MIT Media Lab primarily so he could say \"Trust me, I'm a doctor\". After years in academia his love of media whoring could be held back no longer, so he is presently engaged in selling out by co-hosting Prototype This! for the Discovery Channel. He invents things for his own amusement, giving them designations like Funkenschnorkel, Luftwerfer and Schallfaust, and rarely associates his real name with anything. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
