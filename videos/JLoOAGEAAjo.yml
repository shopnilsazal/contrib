title: 'LoneStarRuby 2015 - Building a binary protocol client in Ruby: A magical journey!'
recordingDate: 1440787578
description: "By Trevor Rosen and egypt\nSometimes we can forget that there's more under the (networking) sun than HTTP. Rapid7's Metasploit team has been working for awhile on a new, pure-Ruby library for Microsoft's SMB protocol. Doing work like this means analyzing wire traffic, working with binary structs, and wrapping everything up into a nice, clean set of abstractions. \nWe'd like to share the developer workflows and lessons learned. If you've ever wondered how to set about building a library for a binary protocol, how to reverse-engineer the byte-by-byte traffic on a network, or thought it would be cool to understand Ruby's networking capabilities from the ground up, this talk is for you!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HBVG/"
