description: "by Ben Nuttall\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nIntroducing Python developers to the world of physical computing and IoT usingPython on the Raspberry Pi.\n\nThere's great fun to be had using the Pi's GPIO pins to connect with the realworld for home automation and IoT projects. Python libraries like GPIO Zero,Picamera and Sense HAT provide a simple interface to GPIO devices, HATs andmore.\n\nI will demonstrate the possibilities and show the power of Python in thisenvironment.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi Foundation is working to put the power of digital making inthe hands of people all over the world, and is well known for its series ofsmall, cheap single board computers.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi runs a well supported Linux distro based on Debian, whichships with a variety of programming tools and educational software. Python isthe main supported language on the platform, used in many educationalresources, and many Python libraries exist for making the most of the Piplatform with other devices.\n\nI will cover:\n\n  * Raspberry Pi Foundation mission  * Raspberry Pi hardware specs  * Raspbian desktop  * GPIO pins  * GPIO Zero (Python library)  * Picamera  * Astro Pi (ESA space mission) & Sense HAT  * More HATs  * Pi projects  * Raspberry Pi community\n\n\nRoom: UD2.120 (Chavanne)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:30:00"
