description: "RailsConf 2018: Testing in Production by Aja Hammerly\n\nTest All the F***ing Time is one of the values of the Ruby community. But how many of us test in production in addition to running our test suites as part of CI? This talk will discuss a variety of approaches to testing in prod including canaries, blue-green deployment, beta and A/B tests, and general functional tests. I'll share a few times these techniques have found bugs before our users did and how you can use them today with your Rails Application."
