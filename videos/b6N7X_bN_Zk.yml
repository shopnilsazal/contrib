description: "PyData NYC 2014\n-Do you fear \"Out of Memory\" errors?\n-Do you wish that there was a way to reduce the memory footprint of your data?\n-Do you cry tears of joy when you can crunch your data on an m1.small rather than an m1.xlarge?\nIf so, this talk is for you!\n\nIn this talk, I will go over conventional and unconventional techniques that I've used to reduce the size of my data. I will go over traditional dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and NMF. In addition, I will go over more esoteric approaches such as Random Projection.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you will be able to understand when and how to appropriately apply these techniques to your own data."
