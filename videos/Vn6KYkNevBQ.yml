First released in 2016, CNI has become the default way to network a Kubernetes cluster. In this talk, I'll explain why CNI is designed the way it is. I'll talk about how CNI is typically used in a Kubernetes installation, including some common and not-so-common gotchas and pain points. I'll go into detail about the best-practices for writing a CNI plugin with Kubernetes. I'll also discuss the future of the project, some possible improvements, and next steps for the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nAbout Casey\nCasey Callendrello is an open-source developer at CoreOS. He is a maintainer for the Container Networking Interface (CNI) project. He also contributes to the the Kubernetes project and the Rkt container runtime."
