description: "Guido van Rossum - Type Hints for Python 3.5\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nPEP 484, \"Type Hints\", was accepted in time for inclusion in Python\n3.5 beta 1. This introduces an optional standard for specifying types\nin function signatures. This concept was previously discussed as\n\"optional static typing\" and I similar to the way TypeScript adds\noptional type declarations to JavaScript.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss the motivation for this work and show the\nkey elements of the DSL for describing types (which, by the way is\nbackward compatible with Python 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4). Note: *Python will\nremain a dynamically\ntyped language, and I have no desire to ever make type hints\nmandatory, even by convention!*"
