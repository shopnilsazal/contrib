This talk starts with describing a few crazy ideas we have tested. The first, known as “Knowledge Vault”, used 15 extractors to automatically extract knowledge from 1B+ Webpages, obtaining 3B+ distinct (subject, predicate, object) knowledge triples and predicting well-calibrated probabilities for extracted triples. The second, known as “Knowledge-Based Trust”, estimated the trustworthiness of 119M webpages and 5.6M websites based on the correctness of their factual information. We then present how we bring the ideas to business in filling the gap between the knowledge at existing knowledge bases and the knowledge in the world."
