description: "Presented with the realization that his thunder for his original talk had been covered by the presenters from the previous day Blake switched it up and conducts an insightful panel with the Go team, instead of his original presentation: \n\nGo's stdlib is filled with interesting solutions to fun problems. I will surface them for your amusement and also in hopes to give everyone a better understanding of Go's use of its own simple, yet powerful features.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0V/"
