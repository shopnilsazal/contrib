description: "Using Ruby In Security Critical Applications by Tom Macklin\n\nWe’ve worked to improve security in MRI for a variety of security critical applications, and will describe some of our successes and failures in terms of real-world applications and their various runtime environments. We will describe some of the security principles that guide our work, and how they fit in with the ruby culture. We will also introduce some objectives we have moving forward to improve ruby’s security, and ways we’d like to engage the community to help.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H1hn/"
