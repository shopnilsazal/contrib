description: "Code that talks only to itself is not useful to anyone. Code that enables other code magnifies its power 10-fold.\n\nBut how do we enable other code, and those who write it? What makes a module extensible? What is that vague extra something that turns merely extensible code into an API, a library, and a cornerstone of other systems? How do we harness that power for ourselves?\n\nLet us examine the Aphorisms of Good API design, and the 8-Fold Path of API Nirvana.\n\nThis session goes beyond how to write code well to cover the question of how to write libraries that spawn other libraries and innovation by Coding for the Future.\n\nhttps://joind.in/talk/view/9367\n\nSlides : http://www.garfieldtech.com/presentations/forumphp2013-aphorisms-api/\n\nhttp://www.afup.org"
