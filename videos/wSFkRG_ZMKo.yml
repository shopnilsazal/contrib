recordingDate: 1528977024
description: "Right now voice assistants are on the rise, but they can be... well... hit and miss. As all the big players are heavily investing in commoditising voice UI, let’s suppose they’ll be much more ubiquitous in the near future.\n\nWhat does that mean for technologists? Will screen UI even be required? Should we be changing our workflow or strategy now? In this talk, Ben will look at the current capabilities of Voice UIs, what’s next, and how we might design for a voice-first future. If you’re lucky, he’ll try an amusing but foolhardy live demo of how to fake a voice UI .\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018. For more information, check reaktorbreakpoint.com. \n\n---\n\nBen Sauer\nVoice UI Expert\n\nBen Sauer is a design strategist for Clearleft. Most of the time, he works with organisations around the world to raise their design game. He’s been speaking about voice UI at events for several years, and training teams in how to rapidly prototype voice interfaces. He’s also spent many hours at home listening to his kids put ridiculous things on Alexa’s shopping list."
