title: 'GeeCON 2017: Jakub Pilimon - Event Sourcing and CQRS with Spring Stream'
recordingDate: 1502695052
description: 'Event sourced domain naturally leads to messaging infrastructure and CQRS based services. See how we can benefit from getting rid of typical relational database model replaced by events. See how events come along with projections and different read model. In this talk we are going to explore all of this backed by a real Spring Cloud Stream applications. Don''t ever lose information in your ORM-based system again. Leverage eventual consistency and event-driven architecture with the usage of pure Spring tools. Let''s look into internals of databases and see that ideas like ES and CQRS are not new ones. For the fans of Functional Programming, see how you can model your domain with just functions, pattern matching, left fold and immutability. I would like to focus on several aspects: 1. Where to apply Event Sourcing - which is often wrongly recognized as architectural pattern 2. How Event Sourcing is different than ORM-based system with dirty checking. 3. How to apply Event Sourcing with just relational database and spring tools, which can be a good fit for a majority of projects 4. How we can deal with eventual consistency, blue/green deployments, replication, functional decomposition and scaling when using ES/CQRS'
