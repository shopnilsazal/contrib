description: "Dr. Thomas J. Holt: The Market for Malware\nAs the world comes to rely on computers and rapidly changing technologies, the threat posed by computer attackers has become increasingly significant. Computer attackers exploit vulnerabilities in systems and circumvent antivirus software to obtain all manner of personal and financial information. However, individuals no longer need to rely on their abilities, as malware and automated tools quickly and efficiently perform attacks for them. Individuals can buy access to sophisticated malware, including bots, Trojans, and worms via markets run in publicly accessible web forums operating out of Eastern Europe, Russia, and other parts of the world. These forums also operate black markets where individuals can sell the data they illegally obtain for profit. Examining these markets can have significant benefit for computer security and law enforcement by identifying the functionality of malware in the wild, and the individuals who create these tools. This presentation will explore the latest tools and materials being sold in active publicly accessible web forums that traffic in malware and personal information.The cost, functionality, and utility of these programs will be explored, as well as the dynamics of sellers and buyers in these markets.\n\nDr. Thomas J. Holt is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Criminal Justice at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte specializing in computer crime, cybercrime, and technology. His research focuses on computer hacking, malware, and the role that technology and the Internet play in facilitating all manner of crime and deviance. He works with computer and information systems scientists, law enforcement, businesses, and technologists to understand and link the technological and social elements of computer crime. Dr. Holt has been published in academic journals, and has presented his work at various computer security and criminology conferences. He is also a member of the editorial board of the International Journal of Cyber Criminology."
