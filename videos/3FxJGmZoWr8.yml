description: "PyData New York City 2017\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/the-law-and-ethics-of-datadriven-artificial-intelligence\n\nThis talk is a completely non-technical discussion of how the law currently regulates artificial intelligence (if it does at all) and what is likely to change in the near future. The talk is geared towards technically-minded practitioners of data driven intelligence with the aim of increasing discussion of the social and ethical impact of data driven AI and how to code responsibly."
