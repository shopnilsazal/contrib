title: 'RedDotRuby 2015 - Ruby based Distributed Key Value Store ''ROMA'' by Hiroaki Iwase'
recordingDate: 1433974339
description: "Ruby based Distributed Key Value Store 'ROMA' by Hiroaki Iwase\n\nI am going to introduce ROMA(Ruby/Rakuten On-Memory Architecture). ROMA is one of the data storing systems for distributed key-value stores. It is a completely decentralized distributed system that consists of multiple processes, called nodes, on several machines. It is based on pure P2P architecture like a distributed hash table, thus it provides high availability and scalability. This has been developed as an OSS product written in Ruby from 2007. \n\nI will also share a GUI management tool named 'Gladiator', which is developed for Ruby on Rails, enabling developers to control ROMA more easily and intuitively."
