description: "By Andreia Gaita\r\n\r\nMoonlight is an open source implementation of Microsoft Silverlight for Unix systems, developed by Novell. It not only allows existing Silverlight applications to run on Linux, you can also create your own on Linux and MacOS using the MonoDevelop IDE.\r\n\r\nIn this hands-on presentation we'll take a look at what Moonlight provides now, what it can do for developers, what tools are there, and how you can have a lot of fun with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
