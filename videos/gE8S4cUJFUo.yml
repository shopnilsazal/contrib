description: "RailsConf 2018: Why We Never Get to Web Accessibility 102 by Liz Certa\n\nCreating truly 100% accessible websites often requires specialized knowledge of the ins and outs of screen reader settings, browser defaults and HTML quirks, yet most of us still need to google how to turn on a screen reader. We attend \"Web Accessibility 101\" seminars and workshops over and over but very few of us end up with the kind of specialized knowledge necessary to make truly accessible websites. In this talk, we'll discuss why this is, and how we can eventually get to accessibility 102."
