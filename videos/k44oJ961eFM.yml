We are going to practice several powerful memory techniques that have been perfected by memory contest champions over the last hundred years.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you will know how to quickly memorize a foreign language, driving directions, phone conversations, the entire Chuck Norris filmography, your friend's credit card number, a shuffled deck of playing cards, and the name of every person you meet at GORUCO.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGYr/"
