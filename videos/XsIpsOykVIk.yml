description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\nFriday, September 19 â€¢ 2:00pm - 2:45pm\n\nCatch me if you can: Building a Web Malware Analyzer using Machine Learning\n \nWith close to 10,000 new, legitimate websites being added to the Google malware blacklist every day, its clear that infecting websites to spread malware has become the go-to choice for malicious hackers. In this talk I will focus on how the problem is evolving, how websites are getting infected and what gets injected into websites. I will also focus on how to use machine learning to quickly build a system that can scale far beyond what AV engines can catch.\n\nThis talk will show a live demo and will be a mix of powerpoint slides that educate, inform and enable the audience to understand web malware trends and set up mechanisms to catch non obvious pieces of web malware.\n\n\nSpeaker\n\nAnirban Banerjee\nSystems Engineer, CloudFlare Inc.\nAnirban was a co-founder and technical lead at StopTheHacker, acquired now by Cloudflare. Anirban holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California at Riverside. For the last 6 years he has been active in various security circles and working groups that focus on eradication of web-malware and has presented lightning talks at various conferences.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
