description: "by Justus Winter\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nVirtualization is one aspect of our everyday life where multiserver operatingsystems can shine. Given the right underlying architecture, one gets robustand fine-grained virtualization with little effort and code. Achieving thesame on conventional monolithic systems requires careful and invasive changesto the whole system, and the security merely depends on the implementation athand.\n\nThis talk describes and demos how both fine- and coarse-grained virtualizationis implemented on the Hurd, and how virtualization helps users gain freedom#0, i.e. the freedom to shape her computation environment anyway she wants.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 16:55:00"
