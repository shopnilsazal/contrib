description: "Game Programming in Haskell by Elise Huard\n\nGame programming in Haskell: it is possible. I'll talk about the pros and cons of using Haskell for a game, and how to build a game from scratch.\n\nThe talk will cover the basics of functional reactive programming, a technique to handle reacting to user inputs in a UI. I'll also touch on Game design, which is actually the hard part."
