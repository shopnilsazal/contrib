description: "By, Fred Heath\nHave you tried BDD and given up? Thought it was too much trouble for too little reward? Didn't quite work for you? Fear not, you're not the only one. Many of us have been there, done it and got the 'not really my thing' t-shirt. But here's what I learned: it's not BDD, it's us! BDD works really well, but it has to be applied properly, following certain guidelines and avoiding specific errors.\n\nDuring this talk we'll demonstrate the best way to start our BDD journey by defining our system, discovering our Features and writing them correctly, identifying best practices, detecting common traps and pitfalls and learning how to avoid them.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FaTi/"
