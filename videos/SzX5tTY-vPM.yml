description: "Full Stack Visibility with Elastic: Logs, Metrics and Traces - Carlos Pérez-Aradros, Elastic\n\n\"With microservices every outage is like a murder mystery\" is a common complaint. But it doesn't have to be! This talk gives an overview on how to monitor distributed applications. We dive into:\n\nSystem metrics: Keep track of network traffic and system load.\nApplication logs: Collect structured logs in a central location.\nAudit info: Watch for user and processes activity in the system.\nUptime monitoring: Ping services and actively monitor their availability and response time.\nApplication metrics: Get metrics and health information from for application via REST or JMX.\nRequest tracing: Gather timing data by using tools like Zipkin to retrieve and show call traces.\n\nAbout Carlos Pérez-Aradros\nCarlos is a software engineer at Elastic, working on Beats. With love for distributed systems, he has experience in many container technologies and focuses on bringing the right tools to monitor them. When he is not coding you may find him playing with home automation and all kinds of gadgets."
