description: "by: Ethan Gunderson\n\nIt's unanimously decided: SQL is out, everything else is in. Well, that's what everyone is saying at least. If you pick your data store based on the bullet points of their website, this talk is for you. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Yahoo! have been building these systems for years, releasing papers along the way. Lot's of thought went into these systems, and lot's of thought needs to take place when choosing one of their clones. Let's talk a bit about what it means to be eventually consistent, why you should care about distributed systems, BASE vs ACID, and some of the other topics that make these systems stand out from their SQL counterparts. The goal of this talk is to give you some base knowledge that you can leverage when choosing the data store, helping you choose the right tool for the job."
