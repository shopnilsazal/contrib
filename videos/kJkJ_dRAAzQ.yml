description: 'Our lives are filled with choices. And one thing''s for sure: whether you''re choosing what to eat for lunch, to add "just one more gem" to your Gemfile, or to start a new job, your choices *will* have consequences. If that''s the case, let''s step back for a moment to discuss how we tackle this thing we do so many times each day. Maybe we''ll get better at making choices as a result? At the very least, we''ll have some fun. Come equipped with your laptop or smartphone, as you''ll be directly influencing the content of this talk as you make choices of your own! I hope you''ll choose to join us.'
