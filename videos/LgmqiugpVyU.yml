description: "You thought they were dead didn't you? You thought \"I haven't seen a mainframe since the 90s, no one uses those anymore.\" Well you're wrong. Dead wrong. If you flew or drove to DEF CON your information was hitting a mainframe. Did you use credit or cash at the hotel? Doesn't matter, still a mainframe. Did you pay taxes, or perhaps call 911? What about going to the doctor? All using mainframes. At multiple points throughout the day, even if you don't do anything, your data is going through some mainframe, somewhere. 1984? Yeah right, man. That's a typo. Orwell is here now. He's livin' large. So why is no one talking about them?\n\nSoF & Bigendian Smalls, aka 'the insane chown posse', will dazzle and amaze with feats of hackery never before seen on the mainframe. From fully breaking network job entry (NJE) and their concept of trusted nodes, to showing you what happens when you design security in the 80s and never update your frameworks. We'll demonstrate that, yes Charlie Brown, you can in fact overflow a buffer on the mainframe. New tools will be released! Things like SET'n'3270 (SET, but for mainframes!) and VTAM walker (profiling VTAM applications). Updates to current tools will be released (nmap script galore!) everything from accurate version profiling to application ID brute forcing and beyond. You'll also learn how to navigate IBM so you can get access to your very own mainframe and help continue the research that we've started!\n\nAll of your paychecks rely on mainframes in one form or another, so maybe we should be talking about it.\n\nSpeaker Bios:\nSoldier of Fortran: Protect ya REXX! Soldier of Fortran has an unhealthy relationship with mainframes. Being a hacker from way back in the day (BBS and X.25 networks) he was always enamored by the idea of hacking mainframes. Always too expensive and mysterious he settled on hacking windows and linux machines. However, despite not having his own he conducted numerous security engagements against mainframes, slowly developing his skills, until 2010 when he finally got his very own. Not having to worry about system uptime or affecting users he dove in head first and was surprised by what he found. Ever since he has been telling anyone who will listen to him the importance of mainframe security, hacking and research. Heâ€™s spoken both domestically and internationallyon the topic, been a guest speaker at multiple conferences, developed tools for mainframe penetration testing and has even keynoted at large mainframe conferences about this topic.\n\nBigendian Smalls: BS ain't no chump, takin' apart everything as a child just to see how it works invariable led him to security. From BBSin' back in the day to placing second in the network forensics challenge last year he knows what he's doing. At work and at home he does vulnerability research, forensics and disassembly of all things both on hardware and software. Knowing no system is secure and seeing how closed the source, community and information around the mainframe is he got worried. Worried that the code was as secure as they said it was. Worried that because no one is looking, developers are getting away with murder. Sure, IBM says they got their shit together, but then again so does Oracle, CISCO, Fireeye etc . Having worked on mainframes for more than a decade he knows how frustrating this is. With books from the 80s and forum posts from the 90s being of very little value, he aims to help drive the future of mainframe security research."
