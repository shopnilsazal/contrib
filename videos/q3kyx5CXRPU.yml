description: "Functional Composition by: Chris Ford\n\nMusic theory is one of the most naturally elegant and functional domains. It's a perfect fit for Clojure, which is why the Overtone audio environment makes hacking sound so much fun.\n\nChris will start with the basic building block of sound, the sine wave, and will gradually accumulate abstractions culminating in a canon by Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\nBy the end you should agree that anyone who's a developer is a musician too - even if they don't know it yet."
