title: 'Clojure Conj 2012 - Whence Complexity?'
recordingDate: 1433268481
description: "Whence Complexity? by: Michael Nygard\n\nQuantum Mechanics and General Relativity don't agree on much, but both claim that every physical process is perfectly reversible. The Second Law of Themodynamics says, \"Not likely!\"\n\nThe Second Law may win in the long run, but today, at (nearly) every scale, we see structure instead of randomness; complexity instead of chaos. It seems as though the natural state of the universe is ordered to a preposterously unlikely degree.\n\nMichael intends to explain it all."
