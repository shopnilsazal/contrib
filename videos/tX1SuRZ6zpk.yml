description: "RailsConf 2018: Keeping Moms Around for the Long Term by Tess Griffin\n\nBeing a mom is awesome! You finally get to be the one to post a million cute pictures of your adorable baby. It is also one of most challenging and hard things a woman can go through, especially if they're in software.\n\nIn this talk you'll hear stories from women in the programming community, struggles they have gone through, and why many of them left their jobs after or during maternity leave (including me). If you want to help your mom friends stick around and feel included, or if you are from a company who wants to support the growth of your mom employees, then this talk is for you."
