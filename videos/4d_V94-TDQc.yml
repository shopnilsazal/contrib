At a glance wecan see what the current tasks for each member of our team are, whichimportant events are coming up, which music is playing, if it will rain in thenext 30 minutes, ... and much more. In this demo I'll explain how we leveragedboth Laravel and Vue to build the dashboard. After demonstrating the dashboarditself we'll take a deep dive in the code. We'll take a look at the entireflow: the grid system, broadcast events, the Pusher service, some cool Vuemixins and much more. After this talk you'll be able to setup a dashboardusing our code available on Github.\n\n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 14:00:00"
