description: "by Mickael Scherer\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nOne of the main issue with centralized internet services is the commercialexploitation of people private datas, and the relative lack of security ofthose data against states actors among others. Yet, being self hosted andusing smaller provider do not automatically grant protection, and few peopledo have a concrete idea of what steps are needed to efficiently protect theprivacy of others when hosting services, inspired by the policy of Mozilla,riseup and several others groups trying to do the right things\n\nThis talk will mostly speak of the steps required for respecting privacy, witha focus on privacy beyond \"The NSA is trying to catch me\", showing how eventhe best intentions do result in problem for some users, and how sysadmins andactivists can set their systems to protect users without burdening them, andhow things are most often more subtle than we think, in the context of hostingservices.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 12:30:00"
