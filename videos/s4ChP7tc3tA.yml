description: "PyData DC 2016\n\nDask is a relatively new library for parallel computing in Python. It builds around familiar data structures to users of the PyData stack and enables them to scale up their work on one or many machines. This tutorial will introduce users to the core concepts of dask by working through some example problems. The tutorial will be distributed via Jupyter Notebooks."
