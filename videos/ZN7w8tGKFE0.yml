description: "by Robert Kratky\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nHow to turn legacy docs into user-story-based, modular content to better serveusers while reducing maintenance load and overall amount of docs.\n\nIt has become cumbersome to wade through chapters upon chapters of docs,looking for the relevant bits, especially with the advent of embeddedapplications, container deployments, and other usage scenarios that targethighly specialized use cases. We need topic-based, action-oriented content toguide users through specific tasks. So, how do we turn the voluminous guidesof yesterday into lean, modularized narratives that are easy to maintain,scale well, and still allow for a ‘guide-like’ experience when it is required?In this presentation, Robert Kratky will describe the work docs writers at RedHat are doing to solve this problem: re-purposing the existing body ofdocumentation, so that its parts – adapted into modular units to allow forreuse – can be dynamically combined.\n\nTraditionally, Linux documentation has been perceived as lacking in userfriendliness and oftentimes in quality or scope. This presentation will helpattendees understand what problems Linux (and OSS) documentation faces, whatis being done to remedy the problems, and how can existing documentation beimproved or re-purposed to address future requirements and user expectations.The audience is anyone interested in documentation for Linux and open-sourceproducts, which includes technical writers, content strategists, supportengineers, developers, and members of management who want to understanddocumentation processes and new methods of supporting users throughdocumentation. Attendees can expect a presentation and discussion of ways tomodernize existing documentation and adapt it for new expectations with regardto content consumption.\n\n\nRoom: K.1.105 (La Fontaine)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 10:00:00"
