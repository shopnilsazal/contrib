description: 'React in enterprise? You may say: Oh c’mon dude, It’s just a renderer library, how could it be possibly suitable for enterprise where we need so many puzzles for large and maintainable SPA like Dependency Injection, I18n support, Service layer, State Management, Http client, Routing solution, robust Unit testing and E2E solution and many others. In this session I will show you how to get all the pieces together and how we write SPA’s with React at EmbedIT. And yes Typescript is included. P.S.: Pssst, hopefully you might be able to ditch Angular after this talk.'
