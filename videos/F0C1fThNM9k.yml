recordingDate: 1266147010
description: "By David Reyes Samblas Martinez \r\nQi Hardware is a project to build, use and recycle electronic devices around principles of self-organization, all documentation is under CCSA, including internal schematics , building processes, and of course software is GPL, but far beyond that we are trying to make all processes to use only FOSS tools, including design of hardware (kicad), production (testing software), management, marketing etc, etc At the moment we are focusing on our first device, a mini computer called Ben NanoNote. \r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
