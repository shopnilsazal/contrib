description: "Passwords are not Enough by: Greg Baugues\n\nEvery week we hear news of another security breach. We’ve learned that retailers aren’t safe from their HVAC vendors, Seth Rogen can stir an international cybersecurity incident, and not even the venerable OpenSSL can be trusted.\n\nIf you're concerned about the security of your Rails app but don't feel like you can spare the time or effort to implement two factor authentication, this talk is for you. We'll discuss the best ways to protect your users' accounts and live code the integration of two factor authentication into your Rails app in less than 15 minutes using Authy.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/G61E/"
