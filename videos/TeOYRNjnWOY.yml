description: "by Pamela Chestek, Andrew Katz, Björn Lundell and Matthias Stürmer\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nWhen Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) are becoming more broadly deployed(sometimes as part of proprietary systems) amongst organisations who havelimited pre-understanding of the philosophy underlying FOSS there are a numberof challenges which need to be successfully addressed. Such challenges includelicensing obligations for FOSS and a number of associated legal issues, suchas patents, trademarks, procurement law, and various conditions (e.g. FRAND-terms) for use of standards. Many companies and public sector organisationsstruggle with these challenges and there are sometimes tensions and legaldisputes between different interests, which may involve organisations andindividuals contributing to specific open source projects.\n\nThis panel seeks to address the following overarching question: Which are thecontemporary legal and policy challenges needed to be better understoodthrough systematic research studies, and what relevant studies should bedesigned and conducted in order to produce relevant research results as wellas practical outcomes in order to shed light on these challenges?\n\nThe (45 minutes) panel will start with short position statements by thepanellists and a dialogue between them. Significant time will be allocated toan open discussion on the issues with the audience, and those attending areinvited to raise their own concerns and share their own experiences.\n\nWhen Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) are becoming more broadly deployed(sometimes as part of proprietary systems) amongst organisations who havelimited pre-understanding of the philosophy underlying FOSS there are a numberof challenges which need to be successfully addressed.
