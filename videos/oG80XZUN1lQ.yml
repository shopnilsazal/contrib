description: "Java's most ubiquitous library is getting an update! And this is the time to see what's new and weigh in on its course.\n\nThis talk will...\n- show you how to write tests with JUnit 5\n- walk you through the changes compared to JUnit 4\n- present the new architecture\n- discuss compatibility with previous JUnit versions, IDEs, and other testing tools\nBe careful, though: You might end up with an urge to start using it right away."
