description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Ivan Gavrilovic, Google.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-69\nSlides link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KXmV_CzEKN8KwjU3QwIRlhwg8F4D5JsKk-reO4Rhtuk/edit?usp=sharing\n\nYou are probably using Gradle and the Android Gradle plugin every day to build your Android apps. Ever wondered how this is implemented? Interested in extending the Gradle build system with Plugins that would play well with the Android Gradle Plugin, this talk will give you hints on how to proceed.\n\nSecond part of the talk will focus on the future extensions points that we are in the process of implementing. These extensions points will allow anyone to hook into the Android build process in a non intrusive and incremental way.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
