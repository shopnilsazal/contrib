description: "Shahriar Tajbakhsh - Go for Python Programmers\n[EuroPython 2016]\n[19 July 2016]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/go-for-python-programmers)\n\nA side-by-side walkthrough of basic Go history, syntax, semantics and\ntools compared to Python.\n\n-----\n\nThere's been quite a bit of hype around Go for some time. In\nparticular within the Python community, we've seen some engineers\nmoving their stack from Python to Go or starting their new project in\nGo. This talk is **not** about whether you should move from Python to\nGo. Instead, this talk is for those who've been hearing all about all\nthe hype but haven't yet had a chance to take a proper look at Go.\n\nWe'll first _very_ briefly look at Go and Python's history. Then we'll\ngo through a high-level side-by-side walkthrough of basic Go syntax\nand semantics compared to Python. Finally, we'll have a brief look at\na subset of the ecosystem and tools available to Go and Python\nprogrammers for certain tasks such as testing, code formatting,\ndocumentation generation etc.\n\nBy the end, you will not be a Go programmer but you'll have a high-\nlevel feel for how the Go language operates."
