description: "This is the 4th and most likely final part of the Service Fabric Team Tour series. We hope you have enjoyed these informal walkabouts and random chats with engineers who design, code, and build Service Fabric. Software is people!!\n\nAs alway, this is a truly random excursion around the hallways and pods of our team in Redmond, Washington, USA. Thanks to all the folks who kindly played along with us. Special call out to Deep for taking time out of his insane schedule to lead the tour and share his insights and good nature with us. You'll see him again soon :)\n\nTune in and stay tuned for some deep dives into the fabric of Service Fabric.\n\nLOOK HERE:  Interested in a limited edition Service Fabric t-shirt and maybe a laptop sticker, too? Tweet something nice to @deepkkapur and tag with #SFTeePlease\n\nLinks:\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/D-1mfk3Vv-4\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/dfZ7ZAy11Fk\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/qR4ERyihXoA\n\nBehind the Curtain Playlist (bookmark this, as it will grow....): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHh73JryJJ-GWcUtrqpcg2Pb\n\nService Fabric Code: https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric"
