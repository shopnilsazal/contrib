description: "By, Jonathan Jackson\nWith the \"Path to 2.0\" CFP EmberCLI was and is projected to become a first class citizen in the Ember world. And there was much joy. However, it placed a question mark on the Rails integration story. First we had globals, then ember-rails, then Ember App Kit. Just as a bead was being drawn on the proper way... EmberCLI. EmberCLI Rails is a new gem which facilitates an integration story we can love.\n\nFull stack testing (no \"Air gap\")\nsimple installation\nSustainability\nConfigurable setup\nPotential for simple deployments\nLet's learn how easy integration can be."
