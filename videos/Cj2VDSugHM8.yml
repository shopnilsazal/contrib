recordingDate: 1369160316
description: "By Christopher Greene & Aimee Simone\n\nEver wondered what Rails is doing behind the scenes? What happens to an HTTP request after it leaves your browser? How does Rails process the response?\nIn this beginner talk, Aimee Simone and Christopher Green break down the request/response cycle of a web application, navigating through the magestic internals of Rails. We'll outline the responsibilities of each Rails component, including its MVC framework and RESTful routing concepts. By following the flow from a client HTTP request to a completed server response, you'll gain a better understanding of the anatomy of a Rails application.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGa1/"
