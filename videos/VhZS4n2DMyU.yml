description: "Taking Ember Offline by John Kleinschmidt\n\nMillions of web apps are silently suffering and you can help. These web apps are dying because they donâ€™t have the means to work offline. You can end the suffering today. Your Ember apps can have a brighter future by using features like Application Cache, offline storage and Service Workers.\nIn this session we will explore what it takes to build an offline-first Ember app by examining an open source Ember project built to run in locations lacking stable Internet like parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GmtB/"
