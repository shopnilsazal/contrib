title: 'RailsConf 2014 - Front-End: Fun, Not Frustration by Roy Tomeij'
recordingDate: 1400262689
description: "Writing front-end code can be frustrating. That sidebar won't stay on the left, no matter how much CSS you throw at it. The logo looks ugly on your smartphone, but after fixing it, it's broken in browser X. And why encode video in four different formats for that HTML5 player (Flash was so much easier)?!\n\nIt's time to fix the most common issues back-end developers have. Front-end coding should be fun!\n\nRoy Tomeij (@roy) is co-founder of AppSignal in Amsterdam. He has been writing front-end code for Rails since early 2005. He previously co-founded 80beans, one of the earliest and well known Ruby consultancies in Europe. Critically acclaimed banjo player.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1G/"
