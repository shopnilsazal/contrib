title: 'Reaktor Breakpoint 2018: Joonas Vartola, The future of the automotive interface'
recordingDate: 1528977491
description: "The way we interact with the automobile and treat it as a commodity has not changed much since the first cars rolled out of factories more than 100 years ago. But the car is in a transition phase from something we all know well to something a bit more unexpected.\n\nThis change is driven by new technologies and manufacturing methods, advanced materials, improved connectivity, changing legislation, the urban landscape, new ownership models and more.\n\nAll these aspects will reshape the car as we know it. How will we control the car from the inside or outside? How will the car react to its surroundings? How do we make passive elements in a car more active? New drivetrains and higher levels of autonomy are driving major changes to everything from overall structure and architecture to the tiniest of details.\n\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018.
