description: 'For those familiar with the teachings of Uncle Bob, Clean Architecture is no stranger. It''s a set of architectural guidelines that provide a SOLID set of principes on which to base you architecture in order to have a clean, easy to understand and even easier to maintain foundation. This talk will show you how you can implement such an design, using Java, and will demonstrate the power of such a design. It will also show how you can be pragmatic in implementing Clean Architecture and what the possible implications can be when making pragmatic concessions.'
