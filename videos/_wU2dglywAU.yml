description: "​Postgres at Any Scale​ by Will Leinweber\n\nThis is a sponsored talk by Citus Data.\n\nPostgres has powerful datatypes and a general emphasis on correctness which makes it a great choice for apps small and medium. Growing to very large sizes has been challenging—until now!\n\nFirst you'll learn how to take advantage of all PG has to offer for small scales, especially when it comes to keeping data consistent. Next you'll learn techniques for keeping apps running well at medium scales. And finally you'll learn how to take advantage of the open-source Citus extension that makes PG a distributed db, when your app joins the big leagues."
