title: 'PNWS 2014 - Building a Better Future: Advanced Error Handling for Concurrent Programming with Scalaz'
recordingDate: 1418658818
description: "By, Jean-RÃ©mi Desjardins & Eddie Carlson\n\nHere at Whitepages, we are redesigning a search system that must execute tasks concurrently, while providing smart flow-control and recovery in the presence of failures.\n\nWe need a nuanced handling of errors for a variety of failure modes, which standard Futures alone do not provide. The system must also support timeouts at multiple levels in a way that allows recovery of useful information. Furthermore, the plan definition code must be clear, concise, and correct.\n\nIn order to achieve the above goals in a functional and type-safe manner, we need a new, powerful abstraction. We decided to build a new future for ourselves! We would very much like to talk about our experience using and adapting Scalaz and Shapeless to implement functional, multi-faceted error handling of concurrent tasks.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FoG5/"
