description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nMulti-Tenancy in Kubernetes: Best Practices Today, and Future Directions - David Oppenheimer, Google (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nKubernetes offers a set of features which, when used in the right combination and configured properly, enable secure multi-tenant clusters. But it&rsquo;s not always obvious how to map particular multi-tenancy requirements to those features and configurations. As a result, people often resort to spinning up one cluster per user and/or workload, thereby foregoing the utilization and management benefits they could achieve by using a single shared cluster. This talk will describe a taxonomy of various multi-tenancy models that are possible on Kubenetes today, and how to configure the existing security/multi-tenancy features to satisfy each of those use cases. We will then describe some features that are on the horizon to provide even stronger, easier-to-use multi-tenancy in Kubernetes.\n\nAbout David\nDavid Oppenheimer is a software engineer working on Kubernetes and GKE at Google. He is co-lead of the newly-formed Kubernetes multi-tenancy working group, and was previously co-lead of the Kubernetes scheduling SIG. He has been working on Kubernetes since 2014, and prior to that worked on Googleâ€™s Borg and Omega cluster management systems."
