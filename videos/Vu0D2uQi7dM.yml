description: "Beyond Collaborative Filtering: using Machine Learning to power recommendations at Meetup\nCollaborative filtering and other common recommendation algorithms are a powerful technique for some scenarios. I will cover how to design a recommendation system from the ground up using an ensemble classifier and supervised learning to avoid some of the pitfalls of collaborative filtering. From sampling to deployment, we’ve had to invent our approach with few non-academic and non-toy examples to follow. At Meetup we’re all about sharing information and empowering communities, so I’ll present the details of our model as well as some of the new features we are still developing."
