description: "DevOpsDays Chicago 2016 - Untangling Infrastructure Code Through Refactoring by Nell Shamrell-Harrington\n\nThe point of infrastructure as code is to make managing infrastructure as simple as updating a config file and running a command such as “chef-client” or “terraform apply.” However, as code changes and becomes unruly or tangled, it is time to apply a new development practice - refactoring. Refactoring infrastructure code presents unique challenges - particularly when live, in production infrastructure is involved. This talk will show you how to know when it is time to refactor your infrastructure code and to do it with the least risk possible."
