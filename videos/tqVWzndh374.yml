description: "pip has become an immensely popular tool for installing packages in Python, so much so that a bootstrap mechanism for it is now included in the standard library. But it has a dark side. Come and learn about some of the horrors that lurk within pip.

In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nJuly 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
