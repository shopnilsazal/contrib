recordingDate: 1520373442
description: "by Paul Girard\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nKhartis results from an observation: how can we create easily a statisticalmap, with a few clicks, without loosing the scientific accuracy and rigorwhile processing the data? Khartis is not the first mapping tool availableonline! It is, however, one of the few to propose different perspectives ofthe world representation among which the cartographer will choose. In order tofeed the tool with data, you may want to retrieve from the Khartis website thedata used to produce the maps given as examples or to import or copy / pasteyour own datasets. The base maps are geo-referenced and allow you to work onthe proposed entities (countries, regions...) but also on objects identifiedby pairs of coordinates. You can choose between several projections (besidesMercator) and configure the visual appearance of your data.\n\n\nRoom: H.2214\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 09:30:00"
