description: "RubyConf 2016 - Running Global Manufacturing on Ruby (among other things) by Lee Edwards\n\nA few miles from this convention center, Teespring prints millions of short-run custom products every year from modern direct-to-garment printers and ships them all over the world. Like most companies, Teespring's architecture is polyglot, but the core business logic is in Ruby. We'll discuss how we use large at-scale manufacturing and production systems to help anyone, anywhere turn their ideas into reality."
