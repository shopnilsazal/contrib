description: "Matt Bostock, Cloudflare\n\nCloudflare operates a global anycast edge network serving content for 6 million web sites. This talk explains how we monitor our network, how we migrated from Nagios to Prometheus and the architecture we chose to provide maximum reliability for monitoring. We'll also discuss the impact of alert fatigue and how we reduced alert noise by analysing data, making alerts more actionable and alerting on symptoms rather than causes.\n\nThis talk will cover:\n\nThe challenges of monitoring a high volume, anycast, edge network across 100+ locations\nThe architecture we chose to maximise the reliability of our monitoring\nWhy Prometheus excels as the new industry standard for modern monitoring\nApproaches reducing alert noise and alert fatigue\nTriaging alerts into a ticket system\nAnalysing past alert data for continuous improvement\nThe pain points we endured\nEffecting change across engineering teams\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
