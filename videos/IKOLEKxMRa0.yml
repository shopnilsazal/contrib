description: "RailsConf 2018: Debugging Rails Itself by Sean Griffin\n\nTracking down bugs can be hard. Tracking down bugs in a codebase touched by 5000 people is even harder. Making heads or tails of an inheritance-happy codebase like Rails can be a nightmare. How do you find where the bug in save is when save is overridden by 15 different modules?!\n\nIn this talk, we'll look at the process that goes into fixing a bug in Rails itself. You'll learn about every step from the initial report to when the fix is eventually committed. You'll learn how to navigate Rails' internals, and how to find the source of the problem -- even if you've never committed to Rails."
