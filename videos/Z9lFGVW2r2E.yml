description: "by Jorge Salamero\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nKubernetes is a tremendous system for orchestrating your containers ontophysical infrastructure. But troubleshooting Kubernetes can be incrediblychallenging due to the dynamic and isolated nature of the containers itorchestrates. Sysdig leverages the powerful concept of container-aware systemevents and correlates each one of them with super rich metadata Kubernetes.\n\nIn this session we’ll go deep into a real Kubernetes issue involving wget,search domain, glibc, SkyDNS and etcd, and we’ll see how to track them downusing Sysdig.\n\nKubernetes is a tremendous system for orchestrating your containers ontophysical infrastructure.
