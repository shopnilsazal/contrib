description: "Ask EFF: The Year in Digital Civil Liberties\n\nGet the latest information about how the law is racing to catch up with technological change from staffers at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the nation's premiere digital civil liberties group fighting for freedom and privacy in the computer age. This session will include updates on current EFF issues such as NSA wiretapping (with newly released technical information), using the Freedom of Information Act to dumpster dive with the law, tips and tricks for hacking evoting machines legally, how censorship, surveillance and privacy invasions are spreading throughout the world - and how hackers' can defend civil liberties at home and abroad, threats to freedom from digital TV, and much more. Half the session will be given over to question-and-answer, so it's your chance to ask EFF questions about the law and technology issues that are important to you."
