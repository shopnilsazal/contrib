recordingDate: 1266147356
description: "by Clement Game \r\n\r\nThis talk would be about explaining what the shadowcircle project is: \r\n\r\n◦why was it created. \r\n◦what is the philosophy behind this project. \r\n◦what are you concretely able to do with the integrated tools. \r\n◦why is it better than other similar solution (backtrack) \r\n◦Final words : we need contributors to side projects in order to replace some non FOS software. \r\na Demo would also be performed : a vulnerabilities check on remote host ( implies 2 pc, provided by the speaker ) + exploit with specific payload. \r\nshadowcircle is a free GNU/Linux Live CD distribution which was specially crafted for penetration testers. \r\n\r\nForked from backtrack, this distribution aims to: \r\n\r\n◦Remove any peace of non free software that was initially the backtrack packages base, and replace them by FOS equivalents. \r\n◦Bring more documentation about the integrated tools. \r\n◦Integrate cutting-edge security tools that are not yet available in similar distributions.\r\nLinks:\r\n◦http://www.shadowcircle.org \r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
