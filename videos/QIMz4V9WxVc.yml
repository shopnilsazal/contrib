description: "Using Kubernetes API from Go [B] - Alena Prokharchyk, Rancher Labs\n\nAs Kubernetes becomes increasingly popular, the number of integration and monitoring services around it are also growing. The key component of any such service written in Golan is kubernetes/client-go â€“ a package that is used to talk to Kubernetes cluster APIs. During this talk, we will discuss the basics of client-go usage and how they can save the developer time needed for writing an actual app logic. \nWe will also demonstrate the best practices for using the package and lessons learned from the perspective of a developer who does integration work with Kubernetes on a daily basis. Following items will be covered:\n\n* Client authentication in cluster vs outside of cluster\n* Basic list, create and delete operations for Kubernetes objects with client-go\n* How to watch and react on Kubernetes events using ListWatch and Informers\n* Package dependencies (vendor) management\n\nAbout Alena Prokharchyk\nAlena Prokharchyk is a Software Engineer at Rancher Labs. Before Rancher Labs, Alena joined Citrix through the Cloud.com acquisition, where she worked on CloudStack - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. For the past three years with Rancher Labs, Alena worked on developing infrastructure services for Docker containers, and Rancher-Kubernetes integration."
