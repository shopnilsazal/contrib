recordingDate: 1369147461
description: "Craft beer is great. Ruby is great. When you can combine the two, you get a product that can only be described as Liquid Awesome. In this session, we will go over the brewing process and show how Ruby can help make better beer using automation, temperature control, and recipe analysis. We will look at a Ruby application created with recipe design and testing in mind, as well as a Ruby-based brewery control system run on a Raspberry Pi.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGbK/"
