description: "Presentation slides: http://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/igor-markov-software-engineer-google-at-mlconf-sea-52016\n\nCan AI Become a Dystopian Threat to Humanity? – A Hardware Perspective: Viewing future AI as a possible threat to humanity has long become common in the movie industry, while some serious thinkers (Hawking, Musk) have also promoted this perspective, even though prominent ML experts don’t see this happening any time soon. Why is this topic attracting so much attention? What can we learn from the the past? This talk draws attention to physical limitations of possible threats, such as energy sources and the ability to reproduce. These limitations can be made more reliable and harder to circumvent, while the hardware of future AI systems can be designed with particular attention to physical limits."
