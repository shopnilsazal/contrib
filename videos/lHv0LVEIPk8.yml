In this talk Ricardo will dive deep into the variety of current and future container runtimes. What are their pros and cons depending on the type of workload and application. Why stick to old plain Docker? Why use Mesos containers? Why CRI-O? What about Kata containers? After this session the audience will have a better understanding of the container landscape of the Kubernetes CRI and why multiple container runtimes exist and how to leverage their unique capabilities.\n\nAbout Ricardo\nRicardo currently works at Branch as a Sr Data Ops Engineer.
