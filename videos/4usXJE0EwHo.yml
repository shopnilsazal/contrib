description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nHow We Built Contour, and What You Can Learn From Our Experience - Dave Cheney, Heptio (Any Skill Level)\n\nIn 2017 Heptio launched Contour, a Kubernetes Ingress controller built using the Envoy proxy project from Lyft.  This session will cover: - Why we chose Envoy as the data plane for our ingress controller. - How Contour works as a translator from Kubernetes to Envoy objects. The parts that were a good match, the parts that weren't, and how we dealt with it. - Traps, pitfalls, and ambiguities in the Ingress spec. - Specific patterns we developed to reliably watching many different kinds of API resources at the same time. The presentation will also give real world advice on the traps involved in the components that make up a management server, the k8s Go client, gRPC, and concurrency issues.\n\nAbout Dave\nYou can talk to me about Go, Kubernetes, and Contour."
