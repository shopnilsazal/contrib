title: 'AppSec EU 2017 Threat Modeling with PASTA by Tony UcedaVelez'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495760054
description: "Developers needs prescriptive guidance on preemptive design and coding techniques. This can be done blindly or in alignment to both application use cases and the context of abuse cases or threats. This talk will speak to case studies in risk centric threat modeling using the PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation &amp; Threat Analysis) methodology and provide 3 use cases of IoT, E-Commerce, and Mobile Applications.\n\nThis talk will assume that a basic understanding of data flow diagramming, pen testing, security architecture, and threat analytics is understood by the audience. This talk also centers around the idea of modeling threats for applications based upon a higher propensity of threat intelligence, how to harvest and correlate threat patterns to your threat model and also how to correlate a threat model to defining preemptive controls and countermeasures to include in the overall design.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
