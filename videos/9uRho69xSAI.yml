description: "RubyConf 2016 - Continuing Education at Work by Katherine Wu\n\nThe list of things we want to learn is infinite. How many of us have marked items to read/watch, yet never go back to them? Despite the best of intentions, I often only learn what I directly need. It wasn’t until I started running a couple lightweight continuing education programs at work that I followed through on my goals. We’ll discuss strategies for making these programs low maintenance and long-lived, as well as flexible enough to help both more and less experienced folks. If you’ve been looking for a more effective approach to learning, but still outside classrooms, this talk is for you!"
