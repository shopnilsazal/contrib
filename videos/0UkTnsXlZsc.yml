description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/darach-ennis\n\n\nPony is a relatively new LLVM based compiled language supporting ease of integration with native code. This talk takes a deep dive into Pony and the mature Erlang ecosystem. Plus, who doesn't like 'ponies'?\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Learn a little about Pony itself, using Pony, and extending Pony with native extensions.\n- Compare and contrast to the Erlang ecosystem on a joyride through the fields of pony.\n- There will be pictures of ponies, natch.\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Functional programmers, priests of the actor model, Erlangers and the crazy ones interested in the intersection between mechanical sympathy and systems empathy."
