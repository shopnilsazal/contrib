description: 'Join us on our journey towards a reworked and more powerful Windowing model for UWP. In this session we will introduce a toolbox to create more powerful, "big iron" app experiences for productivity scenarios. Learn how your application can adapt to an ever expanding and diverse ecosystem of device form-factors and user experience, how to break out of your window’s bounds - creating rich experiences with floating command bars, palettes and light-dismiss windows – and how to reason over and take full advantage of multi-mon systems, so that you can create great app experiences to help your customers be more productive.'
