description: "Transform live video streams with code and a REPL!! by Mark Wunsch\n\nInspired by environments like Overtone and Sonic Pi, I made Overscan, an open-source live-coding environment to explore ideas in video streaming and broadcasting. Overscan brings the expressive, improvisational power of a Scheme REPL to live video creation and compositing. I will live demo the debut of Overscan, creating a video stream while compositing graphics and text on the fly. I will peel back the layers of abstraction underlying Overscan to reveal its heart: the Racket programming language, the GStreamer multimedia framework, and the GObject Introspection library. This talk will amuse the littlest Schemer or the most grizzled C programmer, and in the end, you’ll be able to use code to bend video to your will. Let’s take back the airwaves! Or have a goof!"
