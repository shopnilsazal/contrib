description: "Office Basic Source Code Management OpenOffice/LibreOffice Basic Development with 3rd-Party Editors, Version Control and Cloud Storage Backup\nby Shih-Ching Yang (imacat)\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nOpenOffice Basic is cool. It can manipulate everything in your document,spreadsheets and slides. It helps you to create complicated reportsautomatically. But OpenOffice Basic is not cool. It lacks everything a modernhardcore developer needs: Personal favorite text editors, version controls,source repositories, etc. OpenOffice Basic macros are created and edited onlywith Basic IDE, and stored in some hidden place in your hard disk, not in thesource form but in XML. They cannot be managed with modern development toolslike svn, git, different text editors, and cloud storage backup.\n\nWhat if there is a tool that let you work off-line, out of the OpenOfficeBasic IDE box, with your favorite text editor, on anywhere on your hard drive?That's why I wrote obasync to do this job: Synchronize your local Basic macrosources with OpenOffice Basic storage. It frees me from Basic IDE and I canapply every source code development tools now.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 12:30:00"
