description: "In this talk Lori Olson has the intention of introducing, or reintroduinge, RubyMotion to the mobile developer. Lots of devs were turned off in the early days, due to the pay-to-play requirement, and the lack of infrastructure. At the end, developers should feel comfortable with the basic toolset, and have just enough knowledge to be dangerous... that is to say, dangerously close to producing their own native apps!\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
