description: "A fully implemented SDLC program is often represented as heavy, time-consuming and not suitable to Agile development methodology\n\nWe'd like to break the myth and show how a very comprehensive security program, managed by a dedicated security office and development Project Manager, can be successfully integrated in agile development project on a real case example. We'll shortly describe the main challenges, the techniques and the procedures helping to overcome the challenges.\n\nWe'll present the Security Lifecycle Management Framework developed and used by us in the last 3 years, and describe how it was integrated into development of new SaaS based fully agile developed product, with emphasis on main activities and roles. Based on the real use case, we will be giving practical tips for development organizations in which security is a fundamental value.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
