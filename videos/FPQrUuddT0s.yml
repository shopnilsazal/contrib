description: "Honza Král - Designing a Pythonic Interface\n[EuroPython 2016]\n[19 July 2016]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/designing-a-pythonic-interface)\n\nWhen designing an abstraction for a complex system (an ORM-like\nlibrary in our case) you face a lot of design decisions and\nchallenges. This talk details how we chose to tackle those when\ndesigning elasticsearch-dsl.\n\n-----\n\nThe json query language for elasticsearch, as well as its other APIs,\ncan be very daunting to new users and can be a bit cumbersome when\nworking with python. That is why we created elasticsearch-dsl - a sort\nof ORM for elasticsearch.\n\nWe will go through the design philosophy and obstacles found during\nthe development - trying to make a more pythonic interface for\nelasticsearch while maintaining access to all of the features of the\nunderlying query language.\n\nThe focus of the talk is more on the library and interface design than\non elasticsearch and its query language itself, that is used only to\ndemonstrate the principles."
