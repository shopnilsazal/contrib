Prior to founding CyberSN.com and #brainbabe, she was the CEO of Percussion Software, the first VP of Sales at Rapid7 (NYSE:RPD) and the VP of Sales for the national technical staffing company Motion Recruitment. Because Diamond herself was hired as an entry-level college graduate and trained to lead technology service organizations and cyber security organizations, she believes the tech community needs to expand its awareness of what it means “to be in tech” and what it means “to be in cyber security.” Diamond desires to achieve a new way of hiring and retaining women in cyber security. \n\nKelly FitzGerald\nVeritas Technologies LLC.\nSenior Principal Information Security Analyst\nKelly FitzGerald is a Senior Principal Information Security Analyst managing both the Customer and Supplier Trust Offices at Veritas Technologies LLC.
