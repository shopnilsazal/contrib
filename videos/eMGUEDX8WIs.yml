description: "By Josh Kleinpeter\nOpenStack is an amazing technology. Or rather, set of technologies. And that set of technologies is vast. Architecting, deploying, configuring, and maintaining an OpenStack cloud is not as easy as say -- your traditional 3-tiered web architecture. It is hard. You have to know the fiddly bits up and down the entire stack.\n\nThis talk will cover some of the pains of delivering a moderately large, production scale cloud infrastructure using OpenStack. I'm not sure I'll provide anyone solutions at this talk, but I may scare up some business for the crazies who install and run these things for a living!\n\nThink of it less as a conference talk and more like a scary ghost story you tell your engineering friends around a campfire.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0J/"
