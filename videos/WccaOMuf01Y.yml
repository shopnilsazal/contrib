description: "Tests are a good tool to verify your code but how do you verify your tests? Mutation testing is a technique to evaluate the quality of your tests by programmatically mutating (i.e. making a series of small modifications to) your code and ensuring that the tests no longer pass. This talk will attempt to demonstrate the value of mutation testing and show you how to use Mutant to improve the quality of your tests and your code.\n\nErik Michaels-Ober is a programmer.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1f/"
