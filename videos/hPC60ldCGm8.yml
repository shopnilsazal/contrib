description: "Configuring Prometheus for High Performance [A] - Björn Rabenstein, SoundCloud Ltd.\n\nA key to Prometheus's success is its operational simplicity. It takes only minutes to get a server with a meaningful configuration up and running from scratch. However, once you need to run your Prometheus server a bit hotter, you will quickly find yourself practicing the dark art of tuning Prometheus command line flags. This talk will shed some light on how to handle various scenarios: How to run Prometheus on a tiny machine or how to utilize a large amount of RAM. How to optimize for very high ingestion rates or for a lot of time series. How to get the most out of your old spinning disk or how to limit the wearout of your expensive SSD. There will also be a sneak preview of ongoing efforts to reduce the required amount of flag tuning.\n\nAbout Björn Rabenstein\nBjörn is a Production Engineer at SoundCloud and one of the Prometheus core developers. Previously, he was a Site Reliability Engineer at Google and a number cruncher for science."
