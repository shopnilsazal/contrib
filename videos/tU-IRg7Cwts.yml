description: "Insecure Expectations - Matt Konda\n\nMany developers rely on tests or specs (with expectations) to verify that our code is working properly. Few of us leverage the tests we are already writing to demonstrate security controls are properly applied. In this technical talk, we will walk through hands on examples of tests that demonstrate how to test for common security issues against an example Rails application (though the concept is not Rails specific).  Although substantial testing is possible with existing tools, this talk will also present a new open source tool which provides developers with a simpler way to write security tests. \nThe goals are twofold: \n• To illustrate some common security issues.\n• To give developers something concrete they can do about them.\n\nIn addition to the technical portion of the talk, the speaker will spend a short time challenging the audience to help OWASP find ways to reach developers.  The speaker has had success in a local community reaching developers through simple community organizing strategies, applied conscientiously over a long period of time.\n\n\nSpeaker\n\nMatt Konda\nFounder, Jemurai\n\nMatt Konda has given numerous industry talks including the following: WindyCityRails - September 2013 - Insecure Expectations; Secure360 - May 2013 - Agile Security by Example; ChicagoRuby - April 2013 - Hack Night with brakeman, burp and secure_headers; OWASP Chicago Meeting - January 2013 - Rails Pitfalls; ChicagoRuby - December 2012 - Rails Security in the Wild; OWASP MSP Meeting - November 2012 - Builders Vs.
