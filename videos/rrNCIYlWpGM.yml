description: "Topic for the talk:\nArtificial intelligence: dystopia, utopia and human creativity\n\nWe are at the dawn in Artificial intelligence era. At one end we have already AI enabled solutions that we use daily (like Google, Spotify, Facebook, Amazon, Siri, various mobile games, Netflix, Areena, K-Ruoka, various medias like Helsingin Sanomat etc.) and on the other: we don't know at all what are the solutions and what they solve in the future, we just know that the potential is huge. At the same time the whole concept of AI is fuzzy and the most of us need better understanding on the topic. Let's explore this together!\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018. For more information, check reaktorbreakpoint.com. \n\n---\n\nHanna Hagström\nDirector of Artificial Intelligence, Reaktor\n\nHanna Hagström is Director of Artificial Intelligence at Reaktor.
