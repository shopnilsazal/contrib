description: "Surveillance platforms for bank compliance\nBank compliance uses models to look for outlier events such as insider trading, spoofing, front running, etc. With the exponential increase in the size of the data and a growing need to use such models, a key question is: How do we scale these models so they run efficiently and at the same time detect outlier events with good precision and recall?\n\nIn this talk, we will describe our experience building, from scratch, a Hadoop-based platform for surveillance."
