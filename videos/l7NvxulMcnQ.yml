description: "by Jesus M. Gonzalez-Barahona\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe Document Foundation Development Dashboard shows detailed data about howLibreOffice is being developed. It also allows for drilling down, filtering,and understanding it. The talk will explore some of these possibilities, byshowing how to look for specific data, for customizing the results, and forsharing the results with others.\n\nThe Document Foundation Development Dashboard visualizes data obtained fromsome systems used to support LibreOffice development: git, Gerrit, Bugzilla...The data is retrieved from them, stored, organized an massaged in a database,and later visualized in the dashboard. The dashboard allows not only to browsethe data, but also to drill down and play with it. The dashboard permits totrack activity (in commits, issues, pull requests, questions and answers,etc.), actors (who is creating the code, who is fixing bugs, who is answeringquestions), and processes (hot long does it take to close issues, or to acceptpull requests).\n\nThe Document Foundation Development Dashboard has been deployed usingGriomoireLab, an complete FOSS system for retrieving data from softwaredevelopment repositories, storing it, and producing different kinds ofanalytics, dashboards and reports.\n\nThe talk will explain how to interact with the data provided by the dashboardfor finding any detail of interest. The talk will also provide hints on how toexploit the data behind the dashboard to obtain specific information.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 16:10:00"
