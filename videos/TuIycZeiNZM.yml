description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nBuilding cert-manager: Migrating Thousands of Users from kube-lego to use CRDs - James Munnelly, Jetstack (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\ncert-manager is a new project, built to replace kube-lego and make x509 certificates first class citizens in Kubernetes. Using custom resource definitions to introduce the concept of Issuers into a cluster, end-users can request signed TLS certificates from an ACME server (e.g. Let&rsquo;s Encrypt), a signing key pair, Hashicorp Vault, or your organisations custom CA through its extensible design. This talk presents cert-manager and demonstrates its new features over its predecessor, and specifically our approach to migrate thousands of users from kube-lego to the new custom resource backed system, without hindering future cert-manager functionality or effecting production users. At the end, we&rsquo;ll go over the roadmap and future plans for the project, as well as how you can get involved!\n\nAbout James\nJames is a Solutions Engineer at Jetstack, which involves helping customers bend and break Kubernetes to their will. He's created a number of extensions to Kubernetes core, including cert-manager (a kube-lego successor), Navigator (DBaaS for Kubernetes), a simple cloud provider for bare metal clusters as well as various contributions to the upstream API machinery.- Wrangling Kubernetes API Internals https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10599-wrangling-kubernetes-api-internals - Extending the Kubernetes API: what the docs don't tell you https://kccncna17.sched.com/event/CU6r/extending-the-kubernetes-api-what-the-docs-dont-tell-you-i-james-munnelly-jetstack"
