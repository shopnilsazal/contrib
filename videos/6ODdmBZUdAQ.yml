description: "Droidcon Paris 2014\nTim Messerschmidt, Paypal\n\nUser authentication in mobile applications is a very common and integral use case. Implementing regular passwords is an easy solution for developers but comes with several pitfalls that impair user experience like (re-)entering passwords, the need to create a new unique password or even just the input of personal data on a flaky keyboard while registering a new account.\n\nIn this talk the security flaws and UX implications of passwords will be discussed and highlighted which different techniques exist that are able to offer a more mobile friendly flow. Highlighting authorization and authentication techniques like OAuth, OpenID Connect and even hardware features like Bluetooth Low Energy this talk will be interesting for anyone who's facing a situation where creating and storing user accounts matters."
