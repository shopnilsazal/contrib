title: '[DevFest Nantes 2014] ''No one at Google uses MapReduce anymore'' - Cloud Dataflow'
recordingDate: 1417093466
description: "'No one at Google uses MapReduce anymore'  - Cloud Dataflow explained for dummies\n\nWarning: this an an algorithmics talk, and it also involves parallel processing. \nThe MapReduce paper, published by Google 10 years ago (2004!), sparked the parallel processing revolution and gave birth to countless open source and research projects. We have been busy since then and the MapReduce model is now officially obsolete. The new data processing models we use are called Flume (for the processing pipeline definition) and MillWheel for the real-time dataflow orchestration. We are releasing them as a public tool called Cloud Dataflow which allows you to specify both batch and real-time data processing pipelines and have them deployed and maintained automatically - and yes, dataflow can deploy *lots* of machines to handle Google-scale problems. \nWhat is the magic behind the scenes ? What is the post-MapReduce dataflow model ? What are the flow optimisation algorithms ? Read the papers or come for a walk through of the algorithms with me.\n\nPrésentation par Martin Görner\n\nSlides : https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jrIY93r9HpB98tV4gUMybEPFd5x_R1vCNcVNQKtNl6g/edit#slide=id.p"
