description: "Time flies like an arrow; Fruit flies like a banana: Parsers for Great Good by Hsing-Hui Hsu\n\nWhen you type print \"Hello, world!\", how does your computer know what to do? Humans are able to naturally parse spoken language by analyzing the role and meaning of each word in context of its sentence, but we usually take for granted the way computers make sense of the code we write.\n\nBy exploring the way our brains construct grammars to parse sentences, we can better understand how parsers are used for computering -- whether it be in the way Ruby and other languages are implemented or in webserver routing -- and recognize when they may be the right tool to use in our own code."
