description: "Have you ever wondered what that ~20MB of code in your Ruby installation is there for? You didn't know Ruby came with an eso- standard library?! Well it totally does, and there's a lot of hidden gems in there just waiting for you to uncover.\n\nAllow me to guide you through some of the more delightful members of the standard library. I will hand pick libraries authored by the pioneers of Ruby and show you the useful bits.\n\nTogether we'll discover the bountiful archive of libraries that come packaged with Ruby.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8J/"
