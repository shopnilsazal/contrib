description: "Satellites are talking to us! Let’s hear them out! by Ed Medvedev\n\nOver 1,500 human-made satellites are currently orbiting the Earth, and most of them are quite chatty! You might immediately think about the ones we use daily – for TV, GPS, or the internet – but there are hundreds of much smaller and lesser-known satellites that are just as deserving of our attention and love!\n\nLet’s hear what they have to say! We’ll build an antenna out of spare coat hangers and use it to listen to the tiny amateur satellites telling stories about the world around us, playing music, delivering messages, or even speaking in lovely robotic voices!"
