description: "The Ruby community is obsessed with testing, supposedly. In my experience about four out of five applications have either zero or completely ineffective test coverage.\n\nHave the courage to change it. Whether your own projects or recovering someone else's mess, let's talk strategy:\n\n* Starting with metrics\n* Refactoring for understanding\n* Comment-driven development\n* The unit testing foundation\n* Bug reports are your best integration tests\n* Focusing on value\n\nRescue projects are popping up everywhere, and a strategic testing approach can save the day.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GZCY/"
