description: 'Steve McGuire shares how Netflix achieved a completely declarative, React-based architecture thatâ€™s fast on the devices in your living room. In this talk he covers how and why Netflix adhered to principles like no refs, no observation, no mixins or inheritance, immutable state, and top-down rendering. He also shares techniques the team used to hit tough performance targets, while not compromising the architecture.'
