description: "Two thirds of honeybee hives have died out in Virginia. Is it possible for us to devise a way of monitoring beehives in remote locations to find the cause? Enter a raspberry pi + rails. Using a combination of this robust hardware and software solution, we were able to successfully track, monitor and provide real time reporting on the well-being of hives from across the county. Find out how we used ruby, rails, solar panels and other libraries to provide insight into this problem.\n\nSean is rubyist who works at George Mason University and he has the extreme pleasure of being one of the founders/organizers of the best meetup group out there, Arlington Ruby.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0k/"
