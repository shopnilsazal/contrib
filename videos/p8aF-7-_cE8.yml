description: "BY: EDWARD FAULKNER\n\nPhysically-plausible motion makes applications more usable. Google's Material Design and the iOS Human Interface Guidelines both advocate for realistic animation as a key tool to help users navigate and understand.\n\nThe Ember community is at the forefront of efforts to bring this level of polish to the open web and make it accessible to all developers. This talk will cover both the theory (when and why to introduce fluid motion) and the practice (how to get started today in your Ember app).\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GO1W/"
