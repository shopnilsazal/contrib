description: "PyData London 2016\n\nWith an inventory of millions of products, finding duplicates is intractable by hand. Neural networks can be used to learn a representation that maps duplicates close together in a manifold.\n\nWe trained a network to perform multi-task classification. Using this as a basis, we trained a manifold that maps images to a space where duplicates have a small distance and different products have a large distance.\n\nSlides available here: http://www.slideshare.net/CalvinGiles/finding-needles-in-haystacks-with-deep-neural-networks"
