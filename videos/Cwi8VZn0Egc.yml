description: "Dean Pierce, Brandon Edwards & Anthony Lineberry, Bypassing Authenticated Wireless Networks\nAs the demand for mobile internet access increases, more and more public wireless access points are becoming available for general usage. Unfortunately, as awareness of these access points increases, some companies have been capitalizing on the idea, charging monthly and hourly rates.\n\nThis talk discusses methods of silently bypassing current implementations of authenticated wireless networks. An automated proof of concept tool is released and explained. Some theoretical methods of authentication that might be implemented in the future are also discussed.\n\nBoth Dean and Brandon are undergraduates in computer science at Portland State University. Both have very strong interests in the fields of wireless communications, network security, and cryptanalysis. They are also active members of pdx2600.\n\nAnthony currently works for Logic Library Inc as a software engineer developing static binary analysis software. He has been active in computer and network security since early high school. His main interests lie in kernel development, binary reverse engineering, and embedded systems."
