title: '#HITB2018AMS D2T2 - A New Fuzzing Method for Android - Zhang Qing & Bai Guangdong'
recordingDate: 1524984950
description: "In this presentation, we will introduce a new and novel fuzzing method  for Android. We present ways to find vulnerabilities from quantitative change to qualitative change and our fuzzer exploits the combinations of function points to find vulnerabilities. Our fuzzing method borrows the ideology of model checking by generating combinations to drive the exploration of the state space in a comprehensive way. Using this new methodology we have found about twenty 0-days on smartOS and other phones and using our fuzzing method we have won the first prize in the Smartisan vulnerability digging competition.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we will apply it on OEM devices such as Samsung, Huawei and Smartisan OS where we have identified in total 50+ bugs and vulnerabilities, including many severe ones.\n\nOur aim is to inspire the community with those vulnerabilities that have yet been identified and shown by other methods.\n\n=== \n\nZhang Qing is a senior security researcher from Xiaomi. Previously, he was a senior Android security researcher of Qihoo 360 and visiting scholar of Model Checking Lab in National University of Singapore. He currently works as a senior information security engineer of Xiaomi, in charge of account risk control and IoT devices security. His interests include Android security, IoT security and payment security, specializing in reverse engineering and fuzzing. His work has appeared at syscan360 2016, Black Hat Asia 2017, HITB 2017 and so on. In 2016 and 2017, he won whole yearâ€™s first-place prizes in vulnerability detection of some major companies, such as Samsung, Huawei, Meizu, Chuizi and Xiaomi.\n\n--- \n\nDr. Bai Guangdong is a faculty member in Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT). He received his PhD degree from National University of Singapore in 2015. His research interest spans across the broad areas of mobile security, web security, and protocol verification. During his previous research, he has worked on analyzing authentication protocol implementation, online payment, and Android security. His research has helped identify and fix serious security vulnerabilities for major websites like Sina Weibo. His work appears in top security conferences, such as NDSS, Syscan, HITB and Black Hat Europe."
