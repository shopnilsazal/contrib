recordingDate: 1530521670
description: 'Our world changes fast and at increasing speed. Things that weren''t possible 5 years ago come into reach. Incumbents need to adept to match start-ups that use newer technologies. We are evolving towards smaller, faster, shorter. Smaller teams or even micro-teams, flat organizations, no management, even shorter cycles, smaller components. During this inspiring talk Sander discusses Cynefin, how software development goes wrong, how to go beyond Scrum, why self-organization is hard, why continuous delivery allows you to stop estimating or do projects and why microservices are hard, but essential.'
