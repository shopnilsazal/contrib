description: "View slide presentation here:\nhttp://slides.com/phillipcloud/toys-in-blaze-land\nNotebooks here: http://blaze.pydata.org/presentations/\n\nPyData NYC 2014\nBlaze is a library for harnessing the power of big data technologies. In part deux of the blaze-a-thon, we show motivating use cases illustrating why you might want to use blaze, including a comparison of out-of-core pandas and an experimental backend using the lesser known KDB+. Time permitting, we'll show how easy it is for users of blaze to scratch their own itch by hooking an existing API into blaze via a small set of multiply dispatched functions."
