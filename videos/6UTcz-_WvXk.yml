recordingDate: 1414451794
description: "Native iOS Development with RubyMotion and UnderOS by Nikolay Nemshilov\n\nRubyMotion is a project that allows you to create native iOS apps in ruby. It is basically a compiler of Ruby into Objective-C which gives you access to all the iOS system environment.\n\nUnderOS is a new exciting project on top of RubyMotion that creates a new, ruby and web developers friendly environment around the native iOS framework. It converts all the native mobile development concepts into web-development concepts and allows you to create native iOS applications with HTML, CSS and Ruby (instead of JavaScript).\n\nThis talk will give you a basic overview of RubyMotion/UnderOS concepts and I'm also going to livehack an application on stage to give you a sense of how it looks and feels like.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/F2yZ/"
