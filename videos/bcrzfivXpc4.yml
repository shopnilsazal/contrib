description: "RustConf 2016 - Back to the Futures by Alex Crichton\n\nOne of the core building blocks of any library is the I/O abstraction it works with, but unfortunately they isn't always composable to plug libraries together. The concept of futures is tried and true in frameworks like Scala's Finagle, and provides an ergonomic solution to composing multiple I/O libraries together. This talk will explore the implementation of a cross-platform futures library in Rust backed by the full power of mio and leveraging many aspects of Rust to make futures programming even easier."
