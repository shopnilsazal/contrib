description: "Kubernetes on AWS: Practices & Opinions [I] - Arun Gupta, Amazon Web Services & Raffaele di Fazio, Zalando\n\nA lot of progress has been made on how to bootstrap a cluster since Kubernetes' first commit. It is now only a matter of minutes to go from zero to a running cluster on Amazon Web Services. There are still many fundamental topics to take a simple setup to something that can be run in production in a large enterprise and it is easy to get confused by the number of options and customizations. \nIn this talk we will show both common practices for running Kubernetes on AWS and an opinionated view of those. Specifically, we will cover options and recommendations on how to install and manage clusters, configure high availability, perform rolling upgrades and handle disaster recovery, as well as continuous integration and deployment of applications, logging, and security.\nAt the same time, we will explain how those topics are addressed at Zalando, Europe's leading fashion platform, based upon their experience of operating tens of Kubernetes clusters in production on AWS.\n\nAbout Raffaele Di Fazio\nRaffaele works with the Zalando's Platform Engineering team in Berlin since 2015. There he is working on container technologies, currently focusing on Kubernetes and cluster orchestration. Over the years, Raffaele developed a genuine passion for simplicity and the Golang language. At Zalando, he also helps promoting open source.\n\nAbout Arun Gupta\nArun Gupta is a Principal Open Source Technologist at Amazon Web Services. He has built and led developer communities for 12+ years at Sun, Oracle, Red Hat and Couchbase.
