description: "In this 2017 GDC postmortem, Ska Studios' James and Michelle Silva discuss the  origins and early development days of Salt and Sanctuary. Along the way, they go through the insane development cycle that yielded an unbelievable amount of content for a two person studio, the experiences and challenges of moving to a new platform, and what the road to release was like. \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
