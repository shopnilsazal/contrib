description: "The Go programming language, invented at Google, brings a novel new approach to parallel programming. With a strong focus on developer productivity and software readability, Go shares a lot of design philosophy with Ruby while targeting a different set of problems. Though the use of new language primitives, goroutines and channels, Go applications can solve programs in a highly parallel fashion without the use of locks.\n\nThis talk introduces the Go programming language, discusses the innovative parts of the language's design, and demonstrates how these concepts can be applied to Ruby."
