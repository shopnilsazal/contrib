description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nHow We Used Jaeger and Prometheus to Deliver Lightning-Fast User Queries - Bryan Boreham, Weaveworks (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nThis talk comes from practical experience of running a cloud-based SAAS under Kubernetes for the last two years. Prometheus is good for the big picture view of how things are running, while Jaeger acts like a microscope on the internal workings of your system. You will learn about:* Setting up Jaeger and Prometheus in your Kubernetes cluster* Inspecting Jaeger and Prometheus output for tell-tale signs of trouble * Instrumenting your code (with examples in Go) for more detail* Applying the information gained to optimise your code and tune your system\n\nAbout Bryan\nBryan is Director of Engineering at Weaveworks, delivering deployment, observability and monitoring for containers and microservices. Previously, Bryan has worked on many kinds of systems including financial trading, factory control and bakery. Outside of work he is a father, a keen cook and a helicopter pilot.  Bryan is a maintainer on the CNI project, and also works on Weave Cortex, a scaleable multi-tenant back-end for Prometheus. Previous speaking includes: at FOSDEM 2017, GoLang UK 2016, Cloud Native London meetup, Silicon Valley DevOps meetup."
