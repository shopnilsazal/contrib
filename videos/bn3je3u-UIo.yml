title: 'Alexey Taktarov: Dirty animations in the stateful world – React Kyiv March'
recordingDate: 1522321948
description: "Dirty animations in the stateful world\nAlexey Taktarov, Co-founder & Tech Lead @ resume.io\n\nWe already know how to build pure interfaces, time travel, and write undo-redo logic in a couple of lines of code. But what about animations? We always forget about them and it isn't completely clear how to implement them using (state) ↦ DOM approach. React-Motion provides a spring for more natural UIs, but what if you I'd like to run complex physics simulations? In this talk I'm going to show what tricks I use when working with animations in React, compare different approaches (D3, React-Motion, «dirty components») and illustrate it with a dozen of interactive demos.\n\nJoin us on meetup.com: https://www.meetup.com/Kyiv-ReactJS-Meetup/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/reactkyiv\nTelegram chat: https://telegram.me/reactkyiv"
