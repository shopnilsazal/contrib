description: "by Julian Seward\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nMemcheck is probably the most heavily used tool in the Valgrind suite,checking for invalid addresses, undefined values and memory leaks. In thistalk I'll look back at the history of the tool, then I'll look forwards atsome of the challenges it faces as the hardware and software ecosystemcontinue to evolve around it. I'll talk a bit about some of the effects ofMemcheck on the C++ ecosystem and how it fits into the big picture of makingyour big C++ app crash-free and reliable.\n\nThis talk is aimed at Valgrind (Memcheck!) users and developers. It should beaccessible to C/C++/Fortran developers who have used the tool or are thinkingof doing so.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.119 (Moved from AW1.124)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 09:30:00"
