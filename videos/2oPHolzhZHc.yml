Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nSIG Contributor Experience Deep Dive – Paris Pittman, Google & Tim Pepper, VMware (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nIn this 30 minute session, we will deep dive into one of Contributor Experience current projects - a new developers guide.\n\nAbout Tim\nTim is a software engineer with over 20 years open source development experience. He is currently a member of VMware's Open Source Technology Center acting as an open source developer advocate and contributing to upstream projects such as kubernetes. In his past he's worked on the linux kernel, device drivers, distributions, software update, Android, OpenStack, and an open source golang based orchestrator for multi-tenant containers and VMs that wasn't kubernetes.\n\nAbout Paris\nParis is a Developer Relations Program Manager on the Google Cloud Open Source Strategy team focusing on Kubernetes Community. She has 13 years of professional experience in attracting and retaining engineering talent for organizations and open source projects. She has also been organizing communities in one form or another for over 20 years, and at one point ran enough meetups to subsist solely on the free pizza leftovers."
