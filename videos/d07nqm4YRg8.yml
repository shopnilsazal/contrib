description: "Securing vehicles is a complex challenge. Their increased connectivity leave them to a wide attack surface. The diversity in the technologies used also requires to develop different security assessment techniques.\n\nFrom an attacker’s point of view, one difficulty is the manufacturer-specific nature of the technologies used. The automotive industry is a complex ecosystem, composed of different OEMs and suppliers, at different levels of the production chain.  This variety of actors lead to products having their own specifities, with little publicly available information.\n\nThis talk will present some techniques and developed tools for approaching these black-box systems, from a pentester’s perspective. Different technologies will be discussed. Among them, the CAN network, which is the most safety-critical part and also the last stage of a complete remote-to-physical attack chain. From experience and observations, we will discuss about some effective techniques and references that can be used for gathering information, understanding how ECUs behave and finding vulnerabilities.\n\n=== \n\nKeisuke Hirata is a Security Consultant for NCC Group. He graduated from the French engineering school Supelec (now CentraleSupelec) with a major in Secure Information Systems. He holds the Information Security Specialist certification, delivered by IPA (Information technology Promotion Agency, Japan). Previously, Keisuke was based in Japan and was focusing on automotive security. He performed security testing of ECUs as well as whole-vehicles for different OEMs and automotive suppliers in Japan. He is now based in Singapore, working mainly with companies in the financial industry but continues having a lot of interest for automotive security."
