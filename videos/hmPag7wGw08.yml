title: 'DEF CON 16 - Panel: Black Vs. White: The Complete Life Cycle of a Real World Breach'
recordingDate: 1385428472
description: "DEF CON 16 - Panel: Black Vs. White: The Complete Life Cycle of a Real World Breach\nBlack vs. White: The complete life cycle of a real world breach combines a unique idea and a real-world case study from a client of ours that details the start of a hack to the identification, forensics, and reversing. We will be discussing some advanced penetration techniques and reversing topics. Starting off, we will be performing a full system compromise from the internet (complete with live demos), installing some undetectable viruses, and having a separate team reverse it, and show you what its doing and how it works. This is the ultimate battle of evil verses good.\n\nAdditionally, what would a con be without some awesome tool releases? We will be releasing (and demoing) two tools, one a Windows GUI for the windows folks that does everything for SQL injection rooting, minus making you breakfast, one Linux based tool that auto crawls a site and performs blind/error based SQL injection with reverse command shells using various options for payload delivery.\n\nDavid Kennedy CISSP, GSEC, MCSE 2003, is the practice lead for the profiling and e.Discovery group at SecureState, a Cleveland Ohio based security consulting company.
