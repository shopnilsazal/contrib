description: "In this 2014 GDC Next Session, Interactive Entertainment Law Group's Mona Ibrahim examines the legal landscape for the law of ideas in video games. Whether they remain as mere concepts or become a part of your IP portfolio. Ibrahim analyzes how intellectual property is defined, how it is conventionally protected, and how local, state, federal and international governing bodies regulate and enforce those laws. \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
