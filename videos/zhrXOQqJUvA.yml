description: "The OSINT and reconnaissance landscape is beginning to face some challenges. Current valuable sources such as open sourced lists are already facing offensive and malicious data poisoning. Privacy laws are creating barriers in many areas, and as court rulings are levying increasing fines for playing fast and loose with user data privacy. Social media companies are starting to realize that they actually need to start making profits, and are restricting their data.\n\nSites are aggressively combating web crawling, services like TOR and VPN face uncertain futures, the list of potential hurdles to the future of OSINT and recon seems grim. But fear not. There is still hope - and plenty of it. This presentation will discuss both the challenges and changes to both offensive and defensive reconnaissance that the presenter believes we will see in the future, and strategies that will help mitigate or enhance these changes."
