Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nKeynote: Scaling Deep Learning Models in Production Using Kubernetes - Sahil Dua, Software Developer, Booking.com\n\nWhile there are a lot of machine learning frameworks and libraries available, putting the models in production at large scale is still a challenge. Sahil would like to talk about how they took on the challenge of deploying deep learning models in production: how they chose their tools and developed their internal deep learning infrastructure using Kubernetes. He will cover how they do model training in Docker containers, distributed TensorFlow training in a cluster of containers, automated re-training of models and finally, the deployment of models to serve predictions. At the large scale which they operate on, nothing comes easy. He will also talk about how they optimize their model predictions infrastructure for latency or throughput depending on the use case.\n\n\"About Sahil\nSahil is a software developer at Booking.com. He has been involved in leveraging container infrastructure to help Booking.comâ€™s internal teams in taking advantage of deep learning techniques at scale. An open source software enthusiast, Sahil is a core contributor and community leader for DuckDuckGo's open source organization. Besides that he is one of the contributors to the Git project, pandas - open source data analysis library, Linguist project by GitHub and Go-GitHub project by Google. Sahil has been actively speaking at conferences in last one year including FOSDEM, EuroPython and SIGNAL 2017 to name some of them.\""
