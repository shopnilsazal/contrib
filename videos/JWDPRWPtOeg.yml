description: "Set Design: Putting the \"Art\" in \"Architecture\" by Betsy Haibel\n\nI thought of software architects as petty waterfall dictators. Then I became one. My theater background saved me. In this talk, we’ll look at set design — an ongoing, collaborative process — as a model for a more agile kind of “architecture” than building metaphors allow us. You’ll learn about the most important part of any architecture (hint: people), about using architecture to foster team creativity, and about the agile-architecture superpowers that Ruby gives us. No matter your title, you too can architect!"
