We’ll discuss some relevant issues and approaches to the problem with an eye towards changes that work in the real, deadline-driven world of software development. We’ll also talk about several things that have or haven’t worked in my experience trying to build a culture of learning in a regulated financial services company. For example, a company that’s hesitant to delay critical projects for formal training may be fine with lunchtime workshops. Participants should walk away equipped to start building momentum at any level in their organization towards constant learning and improvement.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GVgl/"
