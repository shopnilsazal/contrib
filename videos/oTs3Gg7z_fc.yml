description: "Intro to Control Plane Engineering - Bob Wise, Samsung SDS\n\nSummary: Building Kubernetes clusters with large numbers of nodes, high pod start rates, or with needs for high availability?  Large, high-performance and reliable kubernetes clusters require engineering the control plane components for demands beyond the defaults.  In this talk we will cover the relationship between the various components that make up the kubernetes control plane and how to design and size those components. Where are likely system bottlenecks, and what are approaches for managing those bottlenecks?\n\nAbout Bob Wise\nBob is the Chief Cloud Technologist for Samsung SDS Research America, and opened the Seattle office for Samsung SDS as home base for the SDS Cloud Native Computing Team. Previously he was the CIO at MTN Satellite Communications, where he was responsible for product strategy and development, including global cloud computing and data center deployments. Prior to MTN, Bob was a VP Engineering in HP's public cloud effort, and led transition to Openstack. He made his way to HP via the acquisition of Seattle startup Melodeo, an early mover in cloud computing."
