description: "What I've Learned about Learning from Teaching People to Code by Tyler McGinnis\n\nIf you’re a front-end developer and you hate learning, you’re going to have a bad time. Over the past few years I’ve taught hundreds of people to learn to code. Along the way I’ve gathered invaluable insights into the way we learn and what helps us to learn most effectively. In this talk I’ll be discussing these insights and how you can more effectively keep up with the quickly changing front-end developer landscape.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GVRj/"
