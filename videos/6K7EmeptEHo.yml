description: "Esoteric, Obfuscated, Artistic Programming in Ruby by Yusuke Endoh\n\nRuby has a rich and flexible syntax. It allows us to write not only an easy-to-read program, but also an \"hard-to-read\" one. This talk will show its unlimited power. We present and demonstrate some esoteric, obfuscated, and even artistic programs that we have ever created, including a program that contains a spinning globe, a robust program that can have any single character removed and still works, a program that consists only of alphabetical letters, and so on. We will also review the implementation techniques."
