description: 'The enterprise is a closed ecosystem with its own rules. Internet is all about openness and freedom. Solving the `Big Data` problem for an Enterprise requires: 1) Maintain large amounts of structured and unstructured data 2) Complying with internal technical standards and enterprisy architectural guidelines 3) Local as well as global enterprise regulations etc. I would like to share how Ruby helped in building a scalable Analytic application. The application uses OLAP Cubes and deals with data slicing/dicing.'
