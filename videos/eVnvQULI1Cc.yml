description: "All the cool cats are using Redis, and with a reason: It's fast, it's robust, it's easy and it's web scale. Put it together with Ruby and it's fun too!\n\nIn this session I will talk about what is redis, what you can do with it, how you can use it from Ruby, why you should be using it already and some common patterns when dealing with it. I will talk about:\n\nwhat REALLY FAST means\nRedis data structures, and mapping them to Ruby objects\nqueuing slow ruby operations with Resque and Sidekiq\nusing redis for cross-language development\natomic counters and generating sequences\ndealing with temporary data in your application\nredis as a cache\nshared sessions (rack-based) with redis\nhow to store relational data in a non relational data store\ninteresting problems when distributing your application. Using Lua scripting for atomic operations\nreducing your memory footprint via compression\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4E/"
