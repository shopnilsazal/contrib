title: 'RailsConf 2017: Decouple Your Models with Form Objects by Andrew Markle'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495810175
description: 'Forms are a crucial part of every app and Rails has good defaults for building them—unless you need something complicated. Maybe you want a multi-step wizard? Or maybe you''d like to pluck attributes from any model? Validation becomes a pain point. So you introduce a state machine, or nest your models, or do some other calisthenic to get everything working. Thankfully there''s a better way! This talk takes a complicated wizard and converts it into a few simple form objects—it''s a deep dive on decoupling models and how you can leverage Trailblazer''s Reform gem to make it even easier.'
