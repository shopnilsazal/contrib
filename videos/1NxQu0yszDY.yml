description: "Jason Scott: THE EDGE OF FOREVER - MAKING COMPUTER HISTORY\nToo often, \"Computer History\" gets shoved into a forgotten bin of irrelevancy, devoid of use for lessons and understanding. Even more often, people often fail to realize they're making history themselves. Jason Scott will walk though the basics of computer history, what to save, how to ensure things last for future generations, or perhaps how to ensure it's never found again.\n\nJason Scott is a hard-core computer historian now celebrating 25 years online, starting when he was 11. He's the administrator of TEXTFILES.COM, a growing collection of computer history, and the director of one released documentary, \"BBS\", on Dial-Up Bulletin Board Systems, and two still-in production documentaries: \"Get Lamp\" (on text adventure games) and \"Arcade\" (on Arcades). At last year's Defcon, he ate a 16-pound lobster named Brian."
