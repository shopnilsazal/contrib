description: "Dead Addict - Unfair Use Speculations on the Future of Privacy - Video\nUnfair Use - Speculations on the Future of Piracy\nDead Addict\n\nPiracy has always been a sophisticated, if not chaotically organized effort - from acquisition, packaging, distribution, risk analysis and managing criminal volunteers.\n\nPiracy has moved from software, to all mediums - books, comic books, knitting patterns, video medium of all kinds. Despite distinctions in types of piracy, there are evolutionary measures that need to take place to address a number of challenges. Between malware codecs, root-kitted software, attempts to flood distribution networks with bad information, and other attacks, there are problems to be solved.\n\nThe future will involve distributed architectures, data integrity measures, reputation management via digital signatures, and standardization of metadata.\n\nI will discuss the state of piracy, and touch as need on its past, then discussing future technologies to address current and upcoming challenges.\n\nThis talk will not spend time discussing the law or ethics, although the distinction between piracy and bootlegging will be made.\n\nEye patches optional.\n\nDead Addict gave a talk at Defcon 2 about the future of piracy and predicted the obvious; music piracy was about to explode and become ubiquitous. When he gave his first speech his in-depth knowledge of piracy was fresh - he had been a senior member in a piracy group and understood the world intimately. It's been several years since Dead Addict's last copyright infringement, so his current insight is gleaned through meticulous study and review of public papers and interviews with admitted pirates. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
