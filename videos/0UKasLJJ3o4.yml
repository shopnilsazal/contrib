description: "Slow tests got you down? As Ruby developers, we watch a lot of tests run in a given day. So why not make it more fun? In this talk, I'll take a light-hearted approach to introducing you to an array of test reporters including MiniTest's Pride, Fuubar, and my very own Nyan Cat Formatter. In addition, I will show how easy it is to make your very own test reporter for both Rspec or Minitest so you can have a more enjoyable testing experience.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGcN/"
