description: "By, Sam Phippen \nGetting started with testing Rails applications can be a frought process. There are a range of different test types that one can write. It's often not clear which type one wants. Without care your tests can begin testing the same behaviour. This is problematic.\n\nIn this talk we'll cover the most common types of test you'll encounter in your Rails applications: feature, controller and model. We'll also talk about ways you can design your tests to ensure your suite is robust to changes in your system. If you'd love to learn more about RSpec, Rails, and testing this talk will be great for you.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/G71U/"
