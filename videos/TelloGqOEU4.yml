But it is not the only case! When you have a big system, you need to test it on much higher level - if only to check if all the components are wired in the right way. You may do it manually, but it is tedious and time-consuming - so you want to automate it. And here comes Python - the language of choice in many QA departments.\n\n-----\n\nWhen you think about Python+testing, you usually think about testing your code - unittests, mostly.

And here comes Python - the language of choice in many QA departments.\n\nI will tell about differences between unittesting and system testing which result in totally different requirements on test management/running systems. I will tell how we use Python (and a little why) to automate our work. Finally, I will tell a little about my \"idee fixe\" - a framework for system testing written in Python."
