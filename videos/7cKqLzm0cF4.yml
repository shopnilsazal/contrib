description: "By, Terence Lee & Kenichi Nakamura\nBlogs were so 2000s. Everyone is talking about real time these days. \nIt should be easy to build a communication platform and become \ngazillionaires!\n\nSo let’s jump in and start slinging some Node! Whoops! I’m pretty sure \nwe can use Ruby everywhere*. I mean, if we can use Ruby to fly some \ndrones then how hard can two-way communication be?\n\nWe are cutting down the amount of code and repetition needed to add \nreal time components to your killer chat app.\n\n“Look at all the code I’m *not* writing!”\n\n* Whoops, still need some Javascript.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGYS/"
