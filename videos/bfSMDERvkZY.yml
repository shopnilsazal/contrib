description: "Grafana is Not Enough: DIY User Interfaces for Prometheus [I] - David Kaltschmidt, Weaveworks\n\nThis talk gives a quick overview of the currently available Prometheus UIs and shows ways to build your own interfaces to enable your workflows. Most popular among the UIs is Grafana, which works well with Prometheus and is lovely for dashboarding, but terrible for troubleshooting. What do you do if you want to slightly modify queries based on your dashboards? How can you explore the keys and values of your metric labels quickly? Having trouble remembering PromQL syntax? This talk presents small building UI blocks to get to your results faster and save the day.\n\nDavid Kaltschmidt\nDavid has been building UIs for the networking industry for over a decade. He is currently with Weaveworks and heads their Berlin office."
