Yet, virtually nothing is known about it's internal organizational structure, its data centers, its global network and its hardware technology stack. In this presentation, I will present the results of a deep analysis of Amazon Web Services (AWS), particularly in light of the multi-day major service outages over the past 12 months, as well as the mandatory fleet-wide virtual machine reboots.\nIn particular, the following topics will be covered in depth:\n\nI. AWS Strategic & Operations Management: Who Leads?\n\nII. Amazon Data Center Infrastructure\n\no Facility Build-outs: The Silent Construction Partner\no Availability Zones & Regions\no Data center locations -- with pictures\no Power Capacity & Redundancy\no Backup Generators\no Acronym Soup: SAE16, SOC1, FISMA, ISO27001, Part11\no Physical, process & technical controls\nIII. Global Network\no Amazon's global network\no Peering Map (public & private)\no CDN/Edge\no OC 192/fiber/submarine cables\n\nIV. Technology\n\no Core Compute: EC2\no Secrets of the AWS Gurus:\no Everything you've read about micros are wrong\no The hidden advantages of m1.large and m1.xlarge\no Creating AMIs\no All your key are belong to us\no Hypervisor vulnerabilities\no Storage: S3, EBS, instance\no Stunning Facts about Elastic Block Storage vs. Instance Storage\no What really happened with the infamous Outage of 2011\no Block-level storage encryption: Step-by-step off-cloud key management\no Services/API & security implications\no XML SOAP signature wrapping attack & the \"great AWS reboot of 2011\"\no Relational Database Service\no DBA co-tenancy on Oracle -- Do you see what I see?\no Instant IPSEC-based virtual network: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\no One of the least appreciated services on Amazon\no Four topologies to choose from (software/hardware mix)\no On-demand Apache Hadoop Map-Reduce (EMR)\no GPGPU (Cluster Compute)\no SSD-based Distributed Key-Value Store \"NoSQL\" (Dynamo)\n\nABOUT KENNETH WHITE\n\nKenneth White is Principal Scientist at Social & Scientific Systems, a global technical consultancy.
