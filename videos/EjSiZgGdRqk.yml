description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nWhat Does “Production Ready” Really Mean for a Kubernetes Cluster? - Lucas Käldström, Individual (Advanced Skill Level)\n\nHow would you describe and set up a “production ready” Kubernetes cluster? How are the buzzword terms “production ready” and “highly available” defined anyway? Can a cluster be created so that it’s end-to-end secured, has no single points of failure, is upgradable without control plane downtime and is conformant? If you have access to automated infrastructure, e.g. via a Cluster API controller, you should be able to do CI testing of your cluster, as well as CD of new configuration and versions. Some call this pattern “GitOps”; to write the desired cluster state declaratively and let a controller reconcile the cluster state. By the end of this talk, you should be able to tell: - What you may consider a “production ready” cluster to be and identify the moving parts - How to secure cluster component traffic - How to minimize failure points - How to manage clusters using the Cluster API\n\n\"About Lucas\nLucas is a passionate Kubernetes Maintainer and Certified Kubernetes Administrator that is excited about all things cloud native. Lucas has been engaged in Kubernetes work for about two years now and been involved in work like porting Kubernetes to multiple platforms, getting Minikube off the ground, being a core contributor in SIG Cluster Lifecycle and maintaining kubeadm. Besides Upper Secondary School Lucas runs a consulting company for Cloud Native tech programming tasks and runs the official CNCF & Kubernetes meetup in Finland. Lucas has been speaking at KubeCon in Berlin and Austin previously, and was awarded the Top Cloud Native Ambassador of 2017 together with Sarah Novotny.\""
