title: 'Ruby Conf 12 - The Celluloid Ecosystem by Tony Arcieri'
recordingDate: 1352743347
description: "Celluloid is a concurrent object framework for Ruby that takes the headache out of building multithreaded programs. However, it's also an ecosystem of subprojects including the Reel web server for WebSockets, Celluloid::IO for evented sockets, Celluloid::ZMQ for ZeroMQ sockets, and DCell for building distributed Ruby programs. This talk will examine all of these components and help you decide which ones to use in your multithreaded Ruby programs.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGfI/"
