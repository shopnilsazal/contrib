description: "Harry Percival - How to build a spreadsheet with Python\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nDo you know how a spreadsheet works?  Can you imagine building one,\nfrom scratch, in Python?  This talk will be a whirlwind overview of\nhow to do just that.  Based on the source code of Dirigible, a short-\nlived experiment in building a cloud-based Pythonic spreadsheet (now\n[open-sourced](https://github.com/pythonanywhere/dirigible-\nspreadsheet), for the curious).\n\nWe'll start from scratch, with a simple data representation for a two-\nby-two grid, and then gradually build up the functionality of our\nspreadsheet:\n- Cell objects, and the formula/value distinction\n- Evaluating cells, from simple arithmetic up to an Excel-like dialect\n- Building up the dependency graph, and the ensuing fun times with\nrecursion (arg!)\n- Integrating custom functions and user-defined code.\n\nShowing and explaining code examples, and alternating with  live demos\n(don't worry, I've done this before!)\n\nAnd it's all in Python!  You'll be surprised at how easy it turns out\nto be, when you go step-by-step, each building on the last... And I\npromise you'll be at least a couple of  moderately mind-blowing\nmoments :)"
