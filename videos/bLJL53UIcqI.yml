Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nBuilding Hybrid Clouds with Istio - Allan Naim, Google & Rohit Agarwalla, Cisco (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nMore and more applications are moving towards a hybrid/multi-cloud deployment model. Enabling request routing, A/B deployments, enforcing security and providing observability are all important elements for modern cloud workloads. Istio’s goal is to connect, manage and secure service endpoints and enabling Istio in a hybrid cloud environment enables superior operations without impacting developer workflows. In this session, we will provide an overview of Istio hybrid cloud deployment models and discuss integration touch points that are important from a hybrid cloud perspective.\n\nAbout Rohit\nRohit Agarwal works on Kubernetes at Google.
