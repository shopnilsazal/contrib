description: "Processing Billions of Events in Real-Time with Heron - Karthik Ramasamy, Twitter\n\nTwitter generates tens of billions of events per hour when users interact with it. Analyzing these events to surface relevant content and to derive insights in real-time is a challenge. To address this, we developed and open sourced Heron, a new real time distributed streaming engine. In this presentation, we first describe the design goals of Heron and show how the Heron architecture achieves task isolation and resource reservation to ease debugging, troubleshooting, and seamless use of shared cluster infrastructure with other critical Twitter services. We subsequently explore how a topology self adjusts using back pressure so that the pace of the topology goes as its slowest component. Finally, we outline how Heron implements at-most-once and at-least-once semantics and we describe a few operational stories based on running Heron in production.\n\nAbout Karthik Ramasamy\nKarthik Ramasamy is the engineering manager and technical lead for real-time analytics at Twitter. He has two decades of experience working in parallel databases, big data infrastructure, and networking. He cofounded Locomatix, a company that specializes in real-time streaming processing on Hadoop and Cassandra using SQL, that was acquired by Twitter. Before Locomatix, he had a brief stint with Greenplum, where he worked on parallel query scheduling. Greenplum was eventually acquired by EMC for more than $300M. Prior to Greenplum, Karthik was at Juniper Networks, where he designed and delivered platforms, protocols, databases, and high availability solutions for network routers that are widely deployed on the internet. Before joining Juniper, at the University of Wisconsin he worked extensively in parallel database systems, query processing, scale out technologies, storage engines, and online analytical systems. Several of these research projects were later spun off as a company acquired by Teradata. Karthik is the author of several publications, patents, and Network Routing: Algorithms, Protocols and Architectures. He has a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Wisconsin, Madison with a focus on databases."
