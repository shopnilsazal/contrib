description: "Disclosing vulnerabilities to a vendor, especially one that doesn't seem to prioritize security the same way we do, can be a source of pain. We may even find ourselves viewing the product vendor as an enemy during this process. But we are faced with a future in which people will interact with connected devices whether they intend to do so or not. Imagine worrying about the security of a connected \"smart\" showerhead in your hotel room. Silly, isnâ€™t it? Yet such devices will be increasingly prevalent, and vulnerable. \nFor this reason, this keynote advocates for why we as security researchers should reframe our relationships with vendors from what is sometimes an adversarial one to a collaborative one. To achieve a better security posture in this industry, this talk offers strategies and tactics for how to improve our methods of working with vendors."
