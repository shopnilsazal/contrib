recordingDate: 1397841588
description: "By Kassandra Perch\n\nTwitter's Flight framework is unobtrusive, powerful, and allows you to structure your client-side javascript more efficiently and makes it more manageable and testable. It gives you tools such as a modular system, event-based architecture, and functional mixins- all with tiny overhead. It even integrates easily with non-flight code, allowing for a piecemeal conversion of old code to a Flight-based system. This talk will go over Flight and how you can start using it, today, to create great javascript applications.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG25/"
