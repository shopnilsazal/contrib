description: 'Picking a new technology is hard. Very often you avoid change at all cost, and go with the devil you know. Another extreme is to do some haphazard implementation and hope for the best. In this talk, Gien will share with you the strategies she tried out to understand three web frameworks she didn''t know beforehand, Freya, Suave and Giraffe, in order to find out if they were a good fit for her needs. Along the way, Gien will discuss some tricks that everybody could use to understand, beyond these specific libraries, what heuristics worked and which didn''t in quickly evaluating libraries and understanding their risks.'
