description: "Recommendation Engines using  Machine Learning, and JRuby by: Matt Kirk\n\nEver wonder how netflix can predict what rating you would give to a movie? How do recommendation engines get built?\nWell, it's possible with JRuby and it's fairly straight forward. Many engines are built purely on support vector machine regressions which map arrays of data onto a classifier, like a star.\nIn this talk I'll explain how support vector machines are built, and how do make a simple movie prediction model all in JRuby."
