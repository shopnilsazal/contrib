He will give an overview of how Riot approaches application security in a fast paced, agile environment. This will include how Riot implements controls which do not negatively impact product development or player experience. David will explain how Riot provides secure coding guidance to software engineers, works with QA, and maintains an application security community of practice.\n\nThere are many options when it comes to understanding and improving an application security program. This talk will address Riotâ€™s efforts in this regard.\n\nBio\n\nDavid Rook is a Security Engineer focusing on Application Security at Riot Games in Dublin.
