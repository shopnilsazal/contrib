description: "PyCon Canada 2015: https://2015.pycon.ca/en/schedule/37/\n\nTalk Description:\nCongratulations, you've mastered configuration management. So now what? SaltStack is not just configuration management. Intelligent orchestration and automation will help to optimize your infrastructure allowing the dynamic adjustment of infrastructure resources based on monitored changes and events. Dave will provide an overview and demonstration of SaltStack Beacons to monitor systems and the SaltStack Reactor to orchestrate automated, pre-programmed responses. Now that 3:00 AM text message notifies you that a problem has been fixed instead of calling you into the data center for the rest of the night."
