description: "By, Brendon McLean\nWhat do you do when your Ruby startup takes off and you realise that Ruby might not be best suited for everything? This talk covers our initial attempts to use Ruby as a data analytics platform, and how we ultimately ended up solving the problem using ideas from LISP and ActiveRecord scopes to bring the power and performance of data science languages to Ruby. We will also cover how Ruby can learn from other languages, and why Ruby is still our language of choice.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FrUV/"
