description: "James Arlen - SCADA and ICS for Security Experts: How to Avoid Cyberdouchery\nThe traditional security industry has somehow decided that they are the white knights who are going to save everyone from the horror of insecure powergrids, pipelines, chemical plants, and cookie factories. Suddenly, every consultant is an expert and every product fixes SCADA. And because they don't know what the hell they're talking about -- 'fake it till ya make it' doesn't work -- they're making all of us look stupid.\n\nAttendees will gain a practical level of knowledge sufficient to keep them from appearing foolish should they choose to opine on any of the various real issues stemming from Industrial Control or SCADA systems. Attendees will also feel embarrassed for something they've said, empowered to call out charlatans, and much less worried about cyberhackers unleashing cyberattacks which cybercause cyberpipelines and cybermanufacturing plants to cybergonuts and cybertakeovertheplanet using cybercookiesofdeath.\n\nJames Arlen, CISA, sometimes known as Myrcurial, is a security consultant usually found in tall buildings wearing a suit, founder of the Think|Haus hackerspace, columnist at Liquidmatrix Security Digest, Infosec Geek, Hacker, Social Activist, Author, Speaker and Parent. He's been at this security game for more than 15 years and loves blinky lights and shiny things. Cyber.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
