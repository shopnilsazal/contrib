description: "Keynote Panel: Moving to the Modern Infrastructure - moderated by Michelle Noorali, Software Engineer, Deis\n\nBecoming cloud native goes beyond the use of containers and Kubernetes, it is looking into other technologies in the stack (tracing, monitoring), it is adapting those technologies to work for your business, feeding back code and updates to the community, and a cultural shift within your team and company.\n\nDuring this panel the audience will hear from end user companies like Amadeus, Ticketmaster and Haufe-lexware who consume cloud native technologies and use it to deliver products and services to consumers and other businesses. The panel will discuss what stage (early testing to full deployment) they are in in terms of becoming cloud native, the changes they are making/have made, the tools they are looking into (OpenTracing, Zipkin, Prometheus, etc.), the motivation for the change, the industry examples they are following, and the contributions they have made back to the open source community.\n\nAbout Michelle Noorali\nMichelle is a Core Maintainer on the Kubernetes Helm project.
