description: "NIST - Missions and impacts to US industry, economy and citizens - James St. Pierre, Matthew Scholl\n\nFounded in 1901 and now part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, NIST is one of the nation's oldest physical science laboratories. Congress established the agency to remove a major handicap to U.S. industrial competitiveness at the time—a second-rate measurement infrastructure that lagged behind the capabilities of England, Germany, and other economic rivals. Today, NIST measurements support the smallest of technologies—nanoscale devices—to the largest and most complex of human-made creations, from earthquake-resistant skyscrapers to wide-body jetliners to global communication networks.\n\nIn this session the NIST and ITL missions and impacts to US industry, economy and citizens will be presented.  Attendees can learn about the current Programs, Projects and Research and Development activities in the US Governments premier scientific institutions.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\nRick Kuhn\nRick Kuhn is a computer scientist in the Computer Security Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. He has authored more than 100 publications on information security, empirical studies of software failure, and software assurance, and is a senior member of the IEEE. He co-developed the role based access control model (RBAC) used throughout industry and led the effort establishing RBAC as an ANSI standard.\n\nJames St. Pierre\nDeputy Director, ITL, National Institute of Standards and Technology\nJames A. St. Pierre is Deputy Director of the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL). ITL is one of six research Laboratories within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with an annual budget of $120 million, 367 employees, and about 160 guest researchers from industry, universities, and foreign laboratories.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
