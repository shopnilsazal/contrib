description: "DEF CON 16 - Joe Cicero &Michael Vieau: Hacking E.S.P.\nHave you gone to school? Are you going to school? Do you work at a school? How do you prove you went to a particular high school, college or university? FACT: Educational institutions MUST keep your personal/confidential information. Therefore, your personal/confidential information might be at risk! This presentation will be about typical software packages found at educational institutions and their vulnerabilities. We will use known attacks to show new vulnerabilities in several typical educational software packages. The presentation will focus on the vulnerabilities, what tools were used to find them, and why successfully exploiting a weak system will allow you to gain access to a secure system.\n\nJoe Cicero is currently a Network Specialist Instructor for Northeast Wisconsin Technical College, he specializes in teaching Linux, Network Security, and Computer Forensics Courses. He is originally from Green Bay and in 1985 he joined the Marines. His final duty assignment was as the Operations Chief for Tactical Warfare Simulations Evaluations Analyses Systems (TWSEAS) where he traveled the world conducting training through use of computer simulations.\n\nMichael Vieau is an independent security researcher located in United States where he conducts security assessments & penetration tests on new and existing technology for various customers (and sometimes just for fun). His main focus is on NIX security, mobile devices, and wireless security. He comes from a wide technical background ranging from network infrastructure, to programming, instructing, & of course security. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
