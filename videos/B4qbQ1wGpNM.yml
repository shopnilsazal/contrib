description: "Find more information here: http://15.droidcon.de/session/lets-get-functional\n\nEver tried functional languages ? Ever been annoyed that every time you get see the same Fibonacci examples or yet another maths problem ?\n\nSo what can functional languages really teach us on our day to day life as Java devs ?\nThis talk will take some concrete examples and show you how some functional approaches will make your life easier.\nWe will see how we can try and bring functional and immutability to our \"beloved\" Android Java 7 and what this brings us.\n\nWe'll be exploring libraries such as RxJava, Auto-Value, Retrolambda and such and see how they can help us shape a more functional Java."
