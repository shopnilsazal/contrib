description: "What Cloak? Recent policy proposals from the US Executive seem to call for government support for strong encryption use by individuals and vendors in the name of protecting privacy and anonymity. Yet strong encryption is still considered a controlled resource, requiring explicit permission to import or export from the US. This is also true for other countries. This talk will try to couch these proposals in light of past crypto rules, illuminate some possible ways forward, and touch on the advantages of and weaknesses inherent in a global cyber domain that has interoperable, strong crypto based encryption capabilities for the masses.\n\nBill Manning has been involved in data communications and Internet protocol design and operations for the past 25 years. He ran one of the first DNSSEC enabled environments, circa 1998, and as such was affected by the difficulties in getting crypto source code released for global use."
