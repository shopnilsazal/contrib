description: "David Brin presenting on Artificial Intelligence the The AI Conference in San Francisco:\nHow Might Artificial Intelligence Come About? Different Approaches and Their Implications for Life in the Universe.\nThose fretfully debating artificial intelligence (AI) might start by appraising the half dozen general pathways under exploration in laboratories around the world. These general approaches offer distinct implications for what characteristics emerging, synthetic minds might display, including (for example) whether it will be easy or hard to instill human-style ethical values. The “Moore’s Law crossing” argument is appraised, in light of discoveries that brain computation may involve much more than just synapses. Will efforts to develop Sympathetic Robotics tweak compassion from humans long before automatons are truly self-aware? It is argued that most foreseeable problems might be dealt with the same way that human versions of oppression and error are best addressed – via reciprocal accountability. For this to happen, there should be diversity of types, designs and minds, interacting under fair competition in a generally open environment."
