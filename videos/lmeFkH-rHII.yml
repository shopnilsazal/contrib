description: "Case Study:  Kubernetes at Comcast - David Arbuckle, Comcast VIPER\n\n\"As of September 1st, Comcast VIPER has deployed Kubernetes to 8 distinct physical locations. Three of these locations are production sites, running applications that provide video services to paying subscribers.\n\nWhen VIPER began development on its Cloud DVR application early last year, it quickly became apparent that the scalability and uptime requirements were going to incur a high operational cost. With upwards of 15 components in a micro services architecture, we placed a bet on Kubernetes to help us develop this application quickly, and to quickly deploy it and maintain deployments in upwards of 10 regionally-located datacenters.\n\nVIPER’s solution integrates log aggregation, monitoring, and load balancing as first class features of our Kubernetes deployments. These features, and the convenience of deploying into Kube, have helped to drive adoption of Kubernetes platform with other teams and products. \n\nBut growth is challenging.  We’ll discuss the social aspect of Kubernetes in the enterprise. How we deal with developer and management expectations, and how features like DNS, beta extensions, and configmaps have inspired spirited debate within our organization.\""
