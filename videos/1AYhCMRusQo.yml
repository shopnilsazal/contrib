description: "Handling of Security Requirements in Software Development Lifecycle\n\n\nThe bigger the company you're working in, the more technologies and methodologies used by development teams you are going to face. At the same time, you want to address security risks in an appropriate, reliable and traceable way for all of them.\n\n \n\nAfter a short introduction of a unified process for handling security requirements in a large company, the main part of the talk is going to focus on a tool called SecurityRAT which we developed in order to support and accelerate this process.\n\n \n\nThe goal of the tool is first to provide a list of relevant security requirements according to properties of the developed software (e.g. type of software, criticality), and afterwards to handle these in a mostly automated way - integration with an issue tracker being used as a core feature.\n\n \n\nWork in progress (currently targeting mainly integration to other systems, automated testing of requirements and reporting) as well as future plans will form the last part of the talk.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\nDaniel Kefer\nHead of Application Security, 1&1 Mail & Media Development & Techhnology GmbH\nDaniel Kefer has been working in the application security field since 2007. Having started as a penetration tester, he soon became passionate about proactive security efforts and working closely with developers.\n\nRene Reuter\nIT Security Consultant, Robert Bosch GmbH\nRen√© Reuter is a security engineer with over 6 years of experience in the application security field. At Robert Bosch GmbH, he works as an IT Security Consultant responsible for identifying vulnerabilities and design flaws that may impact Robert Boschs' applications.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
