description: "Panel: Kubernetes, Cloud Native and the Public Cloud [B] - Moderated by Dan Kohn, Cloud Native Computing Foundation\n\nThe six largest public cloud providers -- AWS, Microsoft, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Alibaba Cloud and Oracle -- are all now major backers of CNCF and Kubernetes. This is a chance to hear their perspective on investments they are making into Kubernetes and other CNCF technologies. How are they using these technologies internally? What changes are they making in their offerings to better suit cloud native enterprises? What is their perspective on the future of container runtimes? How do they deal with customers that need a hybrid cloud solution? Is the infrastructure layer becoming commoditized? What is their ability to differentiate in value added services at the higher layers? What projects should CNCF bring in to help fill out its stack?\n\nAbout Dan Kohn\nTwitter Tweet LinkedIn Connect  Websitehttps://dankohn.com\nDan is Executive Director of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which sustains and integrates open source technologies like Kubernetes and Prometheus.
