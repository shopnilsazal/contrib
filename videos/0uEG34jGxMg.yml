title: 'GeeCON 2017: Alena Varkockova/Petr Krebs -How Docker and microservices helps protect against malware'
recordingDate: 1502694955
description: 'The rising demands on malware protection systems - ever-changing environment, the need to make good decisions fast and learn quickly from data - all pose significant challenges. Performing rich real-time analysis of large number of samples pouring in from over 400 million users, we''ll show how an event-driven microservices architecture is a great fit for our systems. We''ll discuss our first-hand experience adopting microservices and container orchestration. We''ll cover technical aspects such as communication between services or their monitoring, but also how we benefit from our internal Docker cloud, based on proven open-source technologies, to deploy, manage and scale our services. Most importantly, nothing is all roses, which is why we''ll share some of the missteps and difficult trade-offs we had to make during our transition. While having services written in multiple technology stacks enable other teams in our company to participate easily, what are the costs? How do we handle shared libraries and data? Also, what exactly makes a microservice a good citizen in the system? Is running an internal cloud yourself worth the effort? We''ll touch on all these tough questions, too.'
