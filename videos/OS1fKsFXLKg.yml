description: "At FT we built one of the world's fastest media websites, and release to production dozens of times a day. But the architectural and organisational decisions aimed at allowing us to deliver reliable features quickly and consistently don't always fit neatly with the desire to optimise performance.\n\nIn this warts-and-all talk, you'll learn:\n\n- how we build FT.com\n- how a highly componentised, microservices stack with a rapid release cycle can sometimes get in the way of performance\n- some ideas for working around these obstacles\n- that web performance is hard, and no-one's perfect"
