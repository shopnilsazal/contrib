description: "DevOpsDays Boston 2017- Your Emotional API by John Sawers\n\nFeelings are messy and uncomfortable, so why can’t you just ignore them? Because it doesn’t work; you’ll write substandard code and be a suboptimal teammate.\n\nIn this talk you’ll learn how emotions are affecting your work and what you can do about it. I use the metaphor of an API as a way to talk about how your emotional system functions. I’ll go over some of the code in my own emotional API, and how I have refactored it using a toolbox full of techniques.\n\nThis will improve your coding, your relationships, and the arc of your career."
