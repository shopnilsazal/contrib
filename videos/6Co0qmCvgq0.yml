description: "Opal: The Journey From JavaScript to Ruby by Bozhidar Batsov\n\nDon't like JavaScript? Don't like CoffeeScript? Want to use Ruby on the backend and on front-end? Then this talk is for you!\n\nOpal is a Ruby to JavaScript source-to-source compiler, which also has an implementation of the Ruby corelib. In this talk we'll examine how Opal works, where it delivers and where it falls short. And above all - we'll have fun!"
