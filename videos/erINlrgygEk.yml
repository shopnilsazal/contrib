description: "\"Leveraging consistent hashing in your python applications\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - Anfiteatro 2]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nWhile consistent hashing is largely known and adopted in the NoSQL database clusters to solve data distribution and data access reliability, it is less known and used by the typical developers.\n\nThis talk will introduce you to consistent hashing and the problems it solves while going through a practical use case in a python application.\n\nWe will start from its standalone design and scale it out to an optimized clustered version thanks to consistent hashing.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
