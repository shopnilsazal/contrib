recordingDate: 1369350222
description: "This talk+workshop highlights some Ruby libraries that are particularly useful when developing Rails applications. In the talk portion, we'll give an overview of some specific classes and modules, and then in the workshop we'll break into groups to dive deeper into libraries of each participant's choice, with a focus on developing the skills needed to read and understand the Ruby documentation. Time and interest permitting, we'll incorporate test-driven development into our investigations.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGaD/"
