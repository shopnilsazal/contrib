description: 'Operations on power series showcase the elegance and expressiveness of overloading and lazy evaluation. Simple one-liners for sum, product, integral, derivative, functional composition, functional inverse, etc. vividly embody the underlying mathematics, and even improve upon it by banishing subscripts. Series solutions of differential equations come practically for free and generating functions actively generate.'
