description: "by Adam Wulkiewicz\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nBoost.Geometry is a C++ library defining concepts, primitives and algorithmsfor solving geometry problems. It contains a dimension-agnostic, coordinate-system-agnostic and scalable kernel, on top of which algorithms are built:area, distance, convex hull, intersection, within, simplify and much more. Thelibrary contains instantiable geometry classes, but library users can also usetheir own legacy geometry types. It also contains spatial index allowing toperform spatial and knn queries on a collection of geometries.\n\nBoost.Geometry might be used in all domains where geometry plays a role:mapping and GIS, game development, computer graphics and widgets, robotics,astronomy and more. The core is designed to be generic and support thosedomains.\n\nThis introductory talk will be followed by a talk discussing the use ofBoost.Geometry in GIS domain in more detail as it is used for example inMySQL.\n\n\nRoom: H.2214\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 15:20:00"
