recordingDate: 1464358762
description: 'Clojure is a simple, powerful and fun language. With a small syntax its quick to learn, meaning you can focus on functional design concepts and quickly build up confidence. There are also a wide range of Clojure libraries to build any kind of apps or services quickly. With a focus on Immutability, Persistent data structures & lazy evaluation, you will quickly feel confident about the Functional Programming (FP) approach to coding. Discover Clojure in action as we write & evaluate Clojure using the REPL (interactive run-time environment), giving instant feedback on what the code is doing.'
