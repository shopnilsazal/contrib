description: "Getting To, and Through, Our First Black Friday with Critical Apps on Kubernetes [I] - Arnaldo Pereira, Luiza Labs\n\nI'll talk about how we adopted kubernetes in Luiza Labs, where we develop and operate the sales channels of Magazine Luiza, a Brazilian retail company of 4+ USD billion in annual revenue.\n\nHow we deploy the apps, and ended up writing an open source deployment tool; how we scale our clusters; contingency plans; cultural impact on application development; ultimately how kubernetes helped us going through a black Friday smoothly\n\nAbout Arnaldo Pereira\n18 years in technology, half in startups and the others in mid-big companies - most of them managing development and SRE teams"
