description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nGitOps for Istio - Manage Istio Config like Code - Varun Talwar, Stealth Startup & Alexis Richardson, WeaveWorks (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nServices Meshes like Istio enable devops to drive service behavior via configurations. The model with Istio is to enable changing service behavior and their interactions including things like timeouts, circuit breakers, traffic routing, load balancing, A/B testing, canary releases via configuration and such critical configurations need lifecycle, audit, rollout, versioning, rollback etc like code does. This makes developers lives easier because config can be changed and managed like code code using familiar CI/CD pipelines. This can make changing configuration for resiliency controls and their subsequent testing with feedback metrics very easy. Overall, In this talk we talk about how istio config can be managed like code through git based workflows.\n\nAbout Alexis\nAlexis is the co-founder and CEO of Weaveworks. He is also the chairman of the TOC for CNCF, and the co-founder of the Coed:Code meet ups. Previously he was at Pivotal, as head of products for Spring, RabbitMQ, Redis, Apache Tomcat and vFabric. Alexis was responsible for resetting the product direction of Spring and transitioning the vFabric business from VMware. Alexis co-founded RabbitMQ, and was CEO of the Rabbit company acquired by VMware in 2010, where he worked on numerous cloud platforms.
