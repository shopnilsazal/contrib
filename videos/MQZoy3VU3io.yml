title: 'How GitHub Uses GitHub to Build GitHub by Zach Holman'
recordingDate: 1323740945
description: 'Build features fast. Ship them. That''s what we try to do at GitHub. Our process is the anti-process: what''s the minimum overhead we can put up with to keep our code quality high, all while building features *as quickly as possible*? It''s not just features, either: faster development means happier developers. This talk will dive into how GitHub uses GitHub: we''ll look at some of our actual Pull Requests, the internal apps we build on our own API, how we plan new features, our Git branching strategies, and lots of tricks we use to get everyone — developers, designers, and everyone else — involved with new code. We think it''s a great way to work, and we think it''ll work in your company, too.'
