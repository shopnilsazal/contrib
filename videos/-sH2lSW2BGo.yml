description: "MagLev is a Ruby implementation built on top of a mature VM which offers native object persistence. Working with these live objects is awesome - but this image-based development is very different than traditional file-based development. MagLev uses both which has broad reaching effects - from design to deployment.\nIn traditional applications, data and code are separate. Deployments involve pulling new code, updating or migrating the data-store, and restarting or reloading the application which creates a new runtime with this new code.\nMagLev's transient objects behave in this same manner, but committed objects are always there. Migrating these live, persistent objects is quite different. Your 'data' migrations involve things like instance variables, method definitions and class hierarchies, rather than creating tables or updating column definitions.\nIn this talk we will walk through a number of examples including a simple job and worker which use persisted blocks, and how to deploy an application and migrate persisted objects.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2K/"
