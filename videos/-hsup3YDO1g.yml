description: "Description\nIn last few years the quality of machine translation has significantly increased. The first step that pushed that technology forward was the introduction of recurrent neural networks, the second - making them deeper. The presentation will go through the the recent advances in neural machine translation as well as the challenges that are still unsolved.\n\nAbstract\nIn the last two years there has been a lot of hype around the Neural Machine Translation. Is it really that good, and how actually does it work? In this short presentation I will shed some light on what Neural Machine Translation is and how it works. I will go through some popular approaches and describe the recently obtained results. Finally, there will be some hints on what it has to do with Python.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
