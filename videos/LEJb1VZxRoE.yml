description: "Vlad Temian - gitfs - building a filesystem in Python\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\ngitfs is an open-source[1] filesystem which was designed to bring the\nfull powers of Git to everyone, no matter how little they know about\nversioning. A user can mount any repository and all the his changes\nwill be automatically converted into commits. gitfs will also expose\nthe history of the branch you’re currently working on by simulating\nsnapshots of every commit.\n\ngitfs is useful in places where you want to keep track of all your\nfiles, but at the same time you don’t have the possibility of\norganizing everything into commits yourself. A FUSE filesystem for git\nrepositories, with local cache.\n\nIn this talk we will take a look at some of the crucial aspects\ninvolved in building a reliable FUSE filesystem, the steps that we\ntook in building gitfs, especially in handling the git objects (http\n://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects), what testing\nmethods we have used for it and also we will share the most important\nlessons learned while building it.\n\nThe prerequisites for this talk are:\nA good understanding of how Git works\nBasic understaning of Operating Systems concepts\n\n[1] You can get the source here - https://github.com/PressLabs/gitfs; you cand find more details here - http://www.presslabs.com/gitfs/."
