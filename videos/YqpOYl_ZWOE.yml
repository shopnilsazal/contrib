description: "Dark Tangent : CiscoGate\nDark Tangent never speaks at DEF CON because he thinks it is cheating.. but not for the 15th anniversary! Come listen to a behind the scenes account of what really happened during the \"Cisco/ISS Gate\" fiasco from 2005. Throughout the talk the audience will be asked what they would have done at key points and then learn what I chose to do. A cautionary and comical tale of what happens when communication breaks down.\n\nThe Dark Tangent started DEF CON 15 years ago when his $2,000 1gig hard drive let the smoke out, eating his world known BBS system A Dark Tangent System, and forcing him to come up with new ways to be involved in the underground scene. He is constantly amazed that something that was his hobby and a passion early on in life has turned into a career and a lifestyle."
