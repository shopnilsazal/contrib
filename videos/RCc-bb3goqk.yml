description: "by Martin Děcký\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nHelenOS is a portable microkernel-based multiserver operating system designedand implemented from scratch. It decomposes key operating system functionalitysuch as file systems, networking, device drivers and graphical user interfaceinto a collection of fine-grained user space components that interact witheach other via message passing. HelenOS does not aim to be a clone of anyexisting operating system and trades compatibility with legacy APIs forcleaner design. Most of HelenOS components have been made to orderspecifically for HelenOS so that its essential parts can stay free of gluecode, franken-components and the maintenance burden incurred by them. In thistalk I will do the annual HelenOS project update.\n\nPlease note that the talk will be given by Martin Děcký instead of JakubJermář who, caused by illness, will not attend FOSDEM.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 10:45:00"
