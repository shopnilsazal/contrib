title: 'YOW! CTO Summit 2017 Roisin Parkes  - What Working with Diverse Teams Really Means'
recordingDate: 1519095601
description: "What does diversity really mean when we talk about teams? Team members from different countries or cultural backgrounds? Team members with different levels of experience and different technical skills? Cross-functional teams? Teams in different locations? Diversity of thought?\n\nIn reality its all of those things and each of them has its own challenges. In this talk we look at how we can create high-performing diverse teams through purposeful communication and actions.\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages of diverse teams, the most obvious advantage is that diversity can lead to better solutions through differences of opinion. But how do you manage this conflict in the team? How do you turn conflict into creativity and innovation?\n\nWhat if they're all being too nice to each other and there is no conflict?! We will look at how you can build teams that trust each other and are not afraid to fail.\n\nI've been in the tech industry for 20 years, starting out as a software engineer and then moving into Product and Strategy before taking on the role of CTO at Gumtree. This year I've been fortunate enough to be named in the CIO50 for 2017.  I've always been fascinated with tech, starting to code at the age of 9 with my brothers. I'm now teaching my own kids to code and I'm very passionate about making coding accessible for everyone. \n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
