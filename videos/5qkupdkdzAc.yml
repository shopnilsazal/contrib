I think that a great example of such a programmer is Jonathan Blow. He's the creator of Braid, which is a fantastic game, but more importantly, he made Braid almost entierly by himself in three years, and that is amazingly productive considering the quality and scope of the game. Jonathan Blow is definitely a person that does something right when it comes to producing software. I've referred to this video before, but you should really, really, really watch his talk \"How to program independent games\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjDsP5n2kSM) He think about programming in a pretty different way and made me question a lot of assumptions that I had about programming.\n\nTry to be more excited about the problem that you're solving than about your craft - your craft is just a tool."
