language: English
recordingDate: 1495760060
description: "In 2013, a security engineer at Rackspace stupidly opened his mouth in front of his leadership team and DefectDojo was created. No one really enjoys vulnerability management. It is tedious, time consuming, and mentally draining. DefectDojo attempts to streamline vulnerability management by offering templating, report generation, metrics, scanner deduplication, and baseline self-service tools. DefectDojo is currently used by multiple large enterprises and has core contributors from five different companies. It has made several engineers' lives much easier, and it can help you too. Got a ton of findings to dedupe and report on? DefectDojo has you covered. Need to have a dashboard of your team's work? DefectDojo has you covered. Tired of boilerplate report generation? DefectDojo does that for you. Come check out how to make vulnerability management less painful and speed up your appsec program in this talk with demo.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
