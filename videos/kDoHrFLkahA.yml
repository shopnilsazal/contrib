description: "\"Understanding Celery & CeleryBeat\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - Arengo]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nCelery is a distributed task queue for Python. Although it is most popular in the web development ecosystem, it has a wide area of usage from system management to IoT devices. With Celery, transforming a function into a task is quite easy and can add great performance &amp; usability to the applications that we build.\n\nThis talk aims to give attendants a general overview on Celery and its uses. We will walk through the core Celery architecture by introducing key components with the help of various real-world examples. This will also lead to an understanding of the task queue systems in general. Attendants will also gain knowledge about Celerybeat; a tool that focuses on scheduling tasks.\n\nWe will be looking for the answers to the following questions:\n\nWhat is a distributed task queue?\nWhat are the main elements of Celery?\nWhen should we use Celery tasks?\nHow do we use Celery Beat?\n\nAttendants should have a basic knowledge of Python, and a minor development experience.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
