description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nSIG Cluster Lifecycle Intro – Justin Santa Barbara, FathomDB & Lucas Käldström (Any Skill Level)\n\nThe Cluster Lifecycle SIG is the Special Interest Group that is responsible for building the user experience for deploying and upgrading Kubernetes clusters. Our mission is examining how we should change Kubernetes to make it easier to operate. Since the group's formation we have primarily focused on creating kubeadm, a streamlined installer tool and building block to simplify the installation and upgrade experience, and enhance kops, the easiest OSS way to get a production-grade Kubernetes cluster up and running in AWS. We have recently begun building a Cluster API to provide an abstraction of machines across different deployment environments along with a common control plane configuration. In this introduction session, we will present the SIG's mission statement, review recent accomplishments, and discuss our future plans, where you are very welcome to contribute to the discussion. We will also focus on how new contributors can get involved in helping shape the future of Kubernetes' cluster lifecycle management.\n\nAbout Justin\nJustin is one of the kubernetes sig-aws leads and started the kops project, so loves to talk about how to install and operate kubernetes, or on all things kubernetes-on-AWS or on other clouds (particularly GCP, having just joined Google!)\n\nAbout Lucas\nLucas is a passionate Kubernetes Maintainer and Certified Kubernetes Administrator that is excited about all things cloud native. Lucas has been engaged in Kubernetes work for about two years now and been involved in work like porting Kubernetes to multiple platforms, getting Minikube off the ground, being a core contributor in SIG Cluster Lifecycle and maintaining kubeadm. Besides Upper Secondary School Lucas runs a consulting company for Cloud Native tech programming tasks and runs the official CNCF & Kubernetes meetup in Finland. Lucas has been speaking at KubeCon in Berlin and Austin previously, and was awarded the Top Cloud Native Ambassador of 2017 together with Sarah Novotny.\n\nWant to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?
