description: "Jason Scott - TEXTFILES.COM: One Year Later\n\nJason Scott gave you an overview of the many amazing things that happened in the BBS world of the 1980's at the last DEFCON. This time, he talks both about some pieces of history that he forgot to mention, and a wide selection of the most interesting events to happen to textfiles.com in the last year. \n\nHear about the legal threats, the newspaper articles, the links to the Trenchcoat Mafia(!), just how many times textfiles.com has come close to being declared illegal, and why history is so important and yet hated by hackers.\n\nJason will also pull out some nuggets of history about The Works BBS, which was at one point the largest textfiles-only BBS in his bedroom. Specifically, the truth will finally be revealed about the once-dreaded \"L00ZER-B-G0NE\" button.\n\nA quarter million visitors and going strong, textfiles.com has expanded into not only a historical collection but a group of essays about all manner of cultural aspects about BBSes, and where they've brought people today. There is also a new companion site, scene.textfiles.com, run by one \"mogel\", which covers the newest of the new of the textfiles \"scene\", which is still as active as ever. \n\nDEF CON 8.0 was held July 28th - 30th, 2000, in Las Vegas, Nevada USA"
