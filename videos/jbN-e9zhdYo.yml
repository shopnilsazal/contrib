title: '#HITB2018AMS D1T2 - Applying Machine Learning to User Behavior Anomaly Analysis - Eugene Neyolov'
recordingDate: 1524731682
description: "This talk is based on results of R&D project aimed to build a solution for user behavior security analytics. I will describe various methods and ideas for anomaly detection solutions built to understand user behavior trends and find abnormal activity using state-of-the-art neural networks.\n\nThe talk covers things like:\n\n    Empowering a feature selection process with clustering algorithms\n    Checking the quality of data with a serial correlation algorithm\n    Implementing a behavioral whitelisting with scoring analysis\n    Tuning a scoring engine with frequency analysis\n    Advancing scoring engine results with prefix coding\n    Predicting user actions with recurrent neural networks\n    Adaptive threshold for RNN predictions\n    Generating synthetic but realistic datasets\n    Peer group analysis and other interesting ideas \n\n=== \n\nEugene Neyolov is the Head of R&D at ERPScan, a world-leading provider of cybersecurity solutions for SAP and Oracle. Eugene has invested his technical expertise in building a unique platform for vulnerability management and security monitoring of enterprise systems and business applications. His previous conference talks cover topics such as forensics, anti-forensics, cybercrime analysis, bypass of anti-fraud systems and business applications security at events like SAP Insider, ISSA, HITB Amsterdam, Area41, Confidence, Hacktivity, BSides Lisbon, Nullcon, Syscan, and others. Currently, Eugene leads applied research projects for advancing attack and anomaly detection with AI technologies."
