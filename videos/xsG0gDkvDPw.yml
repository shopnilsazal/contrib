recordingDate: 1425915241
description: "BY: JAMIE WHITE\n\nEmber has technology’s most loveable mascot. He’s approachable, thoughtful, and never takes himself too seriously. Our community is like that too.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll learn the story of Tomster: where he came from, how he’s grown, and what he represents. Then we’ll zoom out and see how the minds that gave us Tomster have carefully crafted a framework for creating communities like ours. Finally we’ll zoom back in again to see how to use that framework on a local scale to grow the Ember community worldwide.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GO1S/"
