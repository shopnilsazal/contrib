But what do you do with slow response time when you have application deploying at scale? Slow response time is just a symptom, the root causes might be incorrect CPU/Mem limit configuration, incorrect number of replicas, underlying infrastructure congestion, or, a combination of the above. The corresponding way to solve it could be vertical scale the container, horizontal scale the pod, or reschedule the pod to a different node. In this presentation, we are going to share our lesson and knowledge about managing containerized application performance by leveraging the telemetry information from Istio to assure the application SLA\n\nAbout Endre\nEndre is the VP of Advanced Engineering at Turbonomic, directing a team of developers focusing on new technologies and opportunities to extend Turbonomic's existing capabilities. Previously, Endre was a VP at Goldman Sachs, leading the Systems and Application management team and Network Management team driving the management strategy, design and implementation for Goldman Sachs globally. Endre holds an M.E. in Electrical Engineering from the Technical University of Budapest and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology.\n\nAbout Enlin\nEnlin Xu is a proud graduate of Columbia University and has been a software engineer in Turbonomic since 2011.
