description: "Phil Nash   \nDeveloper evangelist for @Twilio and Google Developer Expert\n\nPhil is a developer evangelist for Twilio serving developer communities in London and all over the world. He is a Ruby, JavaScript and Swift developer, Google Developer Expert, blogger, speaker and occasionally a brewer. He can be found hanging out at meetups and conferences, playing with new technologies and APIs or writing open source code.\n\n\nAn empty database in everybody's pocket\nIndexedDB is not new. It is supported in almost every browser and can power the most modern of client side applications. But there is not a lot of love for it and that needs to change. \nWe'll investigate why we should love IndexedDB and the kind of apps you can create when you have the power of a database in the browser. Then we'll dive into how to use IndexedDB with a look at both the terrifying API and the friendly libraries and Angular integrations that will help us along the way. Together we'll discover a new love for IndexedDB."
