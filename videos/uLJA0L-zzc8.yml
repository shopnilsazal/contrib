title: 'GeeCON 2017: Tomer Gabel - How shit works: the CPU'
recordingDate: 1502694959
description: 'The beautiful thing about software engineering is that it gives you the warm and fuzzy illusion of total understanding: I control this machine because I know how it operates. This is the result of layers upon layers of successful abstractions, which hide immense sophistication and complexity. As with any abstraction, though, these sometimes leak, and that''s when a good grounding in what''s under the hood pays off. The second talk in this series peels a few layers of abstraction and takes a look under the hood of our ''car engine'', the CPU. While hardly anyone codes in assembly language anymore, your C# or JavaScript (or Scala or...) application still ends up executing machine code instructions on a processor; that is why Java has a memory model, why memory layout still matters at scale, and why you''re usually free to ignore these considerations and go about your merry way. You''ll come away knowing a little bit about a lot of different moving parts under the hood; after all, isn''t understanding how the machine operates what this is all about?'
