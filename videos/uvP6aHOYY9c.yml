description: "PyData NYC 2014\nAmericans have over $10 Trillion in 401(K) and IRAs. These assets are mostly left in the default allocation of expensive funds as chosen by employers or brokerages. As a result account holders pay tens of billions of dollars in unnecessary fees for inferior returns. We will explore a simple framework for building retirement portfolios using readily available python packages and publicly available data. We will first use constraint programming to explore the universe of available portfolios. We will then build a simple portfolio rebalancer."
