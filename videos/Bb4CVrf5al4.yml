title: 'Better asynchronous programming with Kotlin Coroutines by Erik Hellman, Hellsoft EN'

description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Erik Hellman, Hellsoft.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-14\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/erikhellman/better-async-with-kotlin-coroutines\n\nAndroid application development is inherently asynchronous. Even the simplest Android application requires the developer to track asynchronous callbacks of the activity, often leading to the infamous callback hell. In this talk, we will have a look at the latest addition to the solutions for dealing with asynchronous programming on Android; Kotlin Coroutines. We'll learn about what coroutines are, how they differ from other models and how to use it with Kotlin on Android.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
