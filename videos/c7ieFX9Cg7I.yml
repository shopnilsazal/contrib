description: "Andrew Kongs & Dr. Gerald Kane - Training the Next Generation of Hardware Hackers -- Teaching Computer Organization and Assembly Language Hands-On with Embedded Systems\nHardware hacking can be lots of fun but can be very intimidating getting started. Andrew Kongs and Dr. Gerald Kane wanted to spread the hardware hacking culture to others and saw incoming college engineering freshman as the perfect crowd to indoctrinate. They developed a set of hardware and software tools to help their incoming students play with low-level software and embedded systems.\n\nAfter sharing the tools with their student audience, they want to share the tools they built with everyone so that those interested can get their feet wet. Want to learn more about the nitty gritty of how microcontrollers and how embedded systems tick (and how to break them) without diving in eyeballs deep? So do many people and the guys from the University of Tulsa are here to help.\n\nAndrew Kongs is an undergraduate at the University of Tulsa and spends time working on embedded systems and doing security research.\n\nDr. Gerald Kane is the Norberg Endowed Chairman in Electrical Engineering. He enjoys finding novel ways to teach material and does research with embedded systems and robotics. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
