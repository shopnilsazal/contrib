description: "In this episode of GALs, Golnaz chats with Ashley McNamara, a Principal Developer Advocate at Microsoft. Ashley has been in the tech industry for almost 20 years. But not in the traditional sense. She spent a lot of her time teaching photoshop workshops, doing business mentoring and building websites. But in 2011, she decided to go all in with front-end development. She found herself working with OpenStack, learning Python, joining Rackspace, then becoming a huge contributor in the Linux and Go communities. She finally landed at Microsoft, weird right? Watch this video to learn more about how this Open Source Gopher joined one of the biggest enterprise companies in the world!\n\nHere are some ways to connect with Ashley:\nhttps://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/ashley-mcnamara\n\nFollow @CH9\n\nFollow @Golnaz89\n\nFollow @Ashleymcnamara"
