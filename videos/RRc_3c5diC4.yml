title: '#HITB2018AMS D2T1 - Expanding Your WMI Lateral Movement Arsenal - Philip Tsukerman'
recordingDate: 1524985237
description: "For quite some time now, WMI has resided in the main roster of techniques used by threat actors to perform lateral movement between endpoints. Despite the vast scope of classes and methods available through WMI, attackers moving laterally seem to rely almost exclusively on the “Create” method of the “Win32_Process” class , diving further into the depths of the WMI model only to perform reconnaissance and establish persistence.\n\nThis talk will exhibit various never-before-seen techniques for authenticated (file-based and fileless) remote execution, using only pure-WMI methods, along with stealthier enhancements of known techniques, all of which subvert many host and network-based methods of detection without using the notorious Win32_Process class.\n\nThe talk will also describe the strengths and weaknesses and provide detection methods for every technique described\n\n=== \n\nI am a security researcher, and part of the Cybereason Innovation Team. While I have been a member of a few blue teams, and have largely focused on network traffic analysis, I am no stranger to reverse engineering, and have successfully dabbled in machine learning. I am always looking to discover new areas of research by trying to find new offensive and defensive techniques, and improving existing ones."
