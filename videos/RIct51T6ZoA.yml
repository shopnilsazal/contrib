description: "All the modern browsers support native JavaScript modules, and it’s a perfect time to start using them, which will change the way we are bundling the JavaScript using Webpack, Rollup, and other bundlers, and how the code is executed. In this session Serg Hospodarets takes a look at how it works, what is the level of support in the browsers and Node.js, plus main findings and gotchas on the way of publishing and using them in production.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
