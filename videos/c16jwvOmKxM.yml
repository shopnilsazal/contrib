title: 'Cooking with Cryptography by Fraser Tweedale'
recordingDate: 1439849937
description: "The ``cryptography`` library emerged in 2014 with the goal of\nbecoming Python's \"cryptographic standard library\".  It is designed\nto be easy to use but flexible, exposing a *recipes* layer for\ncommon use cases, and a *hazmat* layer that provides crypto\nprimitives but demands users know what they're doing in order to use\nthem properly.\n\nThis talk will explain the motivations and goals of the\n``cryptography`` library, take a tour of its features and discuss\nits implementation.  ``cryptography`` will be compared to some other\npopular and emerging crypto libraries.  Finally, we will examine\nsome real-world use of the library.\n\nAudience members should have a passing familiarity with cryptography\n(e.g. know the differences between hashing and encryption, or public\nkey and private key crypto) to get the most out of this talk.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nJuly 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
