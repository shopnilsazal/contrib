title: 'DEF CON 18 - Panel - oCTF: 5 years in 50 minutes'
recordingDate: 1383783037
description: "Panel - oCTF: 5 years in 50 minutes\nOver the past 5 years oCTF has grown and evolved. Running the contest has been a lot of work, a lot of fun, and educational for both the contestants as well as for us. This panel talk will go over everything from the inspirations which started it back at the Alexis Park, right through to this year when we passed the torch to The Tube Warriors.\n\nDC-949 was founded at some point in 2004, and has slowly amassed members of like minded and passionate hackers. Although group attendance rises and falls, some of the core members are Dr. Adam Nichols, Adrian, C-P, Frank^2, Jeffball, Merlin, and Vyrus. In addition to running the oCTF contest at DefCon, and the Barcode Shmarcode contest at Shmoocon, DC-949 members have given talks at numerous conferences including LayerOne, Outerz0ne, and DefCon. They have also released several proof of concept applications including Skynet, TwatFS, and Floodgate.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
