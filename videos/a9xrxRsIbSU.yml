title: 'GopherCon 2015: Dmitry Vyukov - Go Dynamic Tools'
recordingDate: 1438096766
description: 'Dynamic tools can provide significant value for small time investment. But frequently they are underappreciated by developers. In this talk I will describe three dynamic tools for Go: data race detector, fuzzing system and execution tracer. The first two tools are related to bug finding, and the tracer can give insights into performance and latency issues of Go programs. I will also share our experiences of systematically applying such tools at scale.'
