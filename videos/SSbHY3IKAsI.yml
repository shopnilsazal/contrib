title: '#droidconDE: Thanos Karpouzis & Frederico Gonçalves – Modular Android Development'

description: "Learn more: http://droidcon.de/en/sessions/modular-android-development\n\nMicro-service architecture is one of the most hyped topics in backend development the last few years.  However, when it comes to mobile projects, in most cases, we are stuck with big monoliths in our code bases. \n\nIn combination with agile environments, that causes problems not only in project scalability, but also team flexibility.\n \nAt Babbel, we work in full-stack product development  teams, implementing scrum and also set up Android projects, based on a fully modular architecture. This approach allowed us to reduce dependencies and achieve team autonomy, and also sustain a very flexible and highly maintainable code-base.\n \nThis session will be a showcase of our current project architecture, focusing on tools (Gradle, Git Subtrees , Dagger 2, CIs) and best implementation practices, including code examples and configuration snippets.\n \nWe will explore the flexibility that modular architecture provides for feature switches, versioning, demos, testing, quality gates and DCL, but also the overhead of the configuration, the build times and shared code ownership.\n \nWe will also provide migration guidelines from monolith to modular project set-up.\n\nSpeaker: Thanos Karpouzis, Babbel; Frederico Gonçalves, Babbel\n\n#droidconDE – cc-by-sa 3.0"
