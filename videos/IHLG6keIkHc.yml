description: "Michael Brooks \"The Rook\" - masSEXploitation\nThis talk covers the use of chaining vulnerabilities in order to bypass layered security systems. This talk will also cover ways of obtaining wormable remote code execution on a modern LAMP platform. These attacks where developed by me, and they are very new. These attacks are as real as it gets, and the results are making the headlines.\n\"Apocalyptic infection\"\n-- The Register\n\nMichael Brooks: This will be my 3rd year in a row that I spoken at Defcon. According to the Department of Homeland Security I have found a vulnerability with a severity metric of 13.5 which makes it into the top 1,000 most dangerous of all time. I am the top answerer of security questions on StackOverflow.com (The Rook). I actively hunt for vulnerabilities on a verity of platforms. I write exploit code and make it public. hack to live , live to hack\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
