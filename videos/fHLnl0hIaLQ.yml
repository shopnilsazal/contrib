description: "Description\nDebugging machine learning apps is hard. I feel that this topic is important, however, relatively rarely touched compared to, e.g., latest models or new interesting ML applications. In this talk, I will try try to fill that gap by discussing best practices, recommendations and my own experience on the subject.\n\nAbstract\nRecently, OpenAI examined ten popular reinforcement learning algorithms reimplementation and found that six (!) of them contained significant non-breaking bugs [1]. This illustrates the fact that debugging and testing machine learning software is difficult and requires extra attention.\n\nIn particular, machine learning (ML) driven apps exhibit rich spectrum of failure types, specific to the domain. ML systems can be diagnosed:\n\nnot to work at all (e.g., providing nearly random outcomes);\n\nto work with (say) 70% accuracy, but with user expectation of much better performance;\n\nto work on the first batch of data, but miserably failing in production, when new data arrive;\n\nto initially work very well in production, but deteriorating significantly with time.\n\nIn this talk, I will touch on each of the above scenario, describing possible pitfalls and recommended engineering practices, as well as providing real-life examples.\n\n[1] https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-dqn/\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\nDebugging machine learning. Mostly for profit, but with a bit of fun too.\nMichał Łopuszyński"
