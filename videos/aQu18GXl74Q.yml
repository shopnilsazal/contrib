recordingDate: 1398278720
description: "A good design communicates the intended use of an object. In the physical world, this communication is accomplished by \"affordances\", as discussed by Donald Norman in \"The Psychology of Everyday Things\".\nProgramming languages also have affordances, and they influence the kinds of solutions we develop. The more languages we know, the more we \"expand our design space\" so that we can come up with better solutions to the problems we face every day.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2F/"
