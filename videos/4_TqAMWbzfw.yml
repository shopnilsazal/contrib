title: 'GoRuCo 2013 - Deathmatch Bundler vs Rubygems.org by Andre Arko'
recordingDate: 1372886429
description: "The story of the quest to make bundle install faster; in which Rubyists around the world inadvertently DDoS rubygems.org, witness its ignominious death, and vow to rebuild it from the ashes stronger than it was before. Then, a tour of the changes; why is Redis so much slower than Postgres? Marvel at the gorgeous metrics and graphs used to measure and optimize; gasp in delight as we track, live, exactly how many Heroku dynos are needed. Finally, a happy ending: today, the server responds to requests TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE faster than it did before.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG9a/"
