description: "Leigh Honeywell & follower - Physical Computing, Virtual Security: Adding the Arduino Microcontroller Development Environment to Your Security Toolbox\nThe Arduino microcontroller platform entered the world under the guise of \"physical computing\" aimed at designers and artists but just like you can use a paint brush to jimmy open a door, you can use the Arduino in your security toolkit too. Attend this talk to learn how the Arduino makes microcontrollers and embedded hardware accessible to hax0rs too. After a quick tour through the Arduino ecosystem we'll move on to offensive uses. You'll learn about the potential for use in re-implementing classic attacks, potential vulnerabilties in the \"internet of things\" infrastructure, USB driver fuzzing, physical control and perhaps some social engineering as well.\n\nLeigh Honeywell is a jane of many trades. By day she works as a security consultant while finishing up a degree at the University of Toronto. By night (and sometimes over lunch) she is a co-founder and director of HackLab.TO, Toronto's hacker space. She also serves on the board of advisors of the SECtor security conference, has been a Google Summer of Code mentor, and is an avid cyclist, science fiction nerd, and traveller.\n\nFollower admits some responsibility for integrating certain networking and USB technologies into the Arduino ecosystem. He has a particular interest in the intersection of software, hardware, craft and art. He is currently visiting the country to teach an introductory Arduino workshop at a large US tech conference. Occasionally he can be heard mumbling how Tim O'Reilly once called him a \"troublemaker\" for his Google Maps reverse engineering. He is also co-founder of Spacecraft--a New Zealand Hackerspace--and gets the blame for kicking off events that lead to its establishment.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
