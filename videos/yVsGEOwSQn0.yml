recordingDate: 1383700369
description: "Righter Kunkel - Air Traffic Control Insecurity 2.0\nThis presentation will be a follow up to my \"Air Traffic Control: Insecurity and ADS-B\" talk last year. I will give a quick overview of what has changed since last year. I will cover a few insecurity's today. How bad is your network when the FAA requires firewalls between critical flight systems and passengers surfing the web on the new 787 plane. I give a caution to all the executive jet owners that it will be much easier to track flights. As always, I want to open peoples eyes to the insecurity of the ATC system.\n\nRighter Kunkel (CISA, CISSP, CISM) is a security researcher. He is a private pilot with about 230 hours of flight time. Righter's background includes positions as global education manager and senior network security consultant at CyberGuard Corporation.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
