title: 'GopherCon 2014 Building web services in Go by Richard Crowley'
recordingDate: 1400943645
description: "Despite what many compiler-fearing communities may say, Go is a fantastic language in which to build web services. This talk will start by catching everyone up on the Go standard library's HTTP packages, their strengths, and their weaknesses. We'll talk about JSON and its relationship with Go data structures, learn about Go's excellent support for reflection and how we can use it and the Go compiler to create safe APIs. Using some choice open-source packages we'll create higher-level APIs, collect metrics, and write tests. Finally, we'll get our Go web services into production and talk about stopping gracefully and restarting without downtime.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGZq/"
