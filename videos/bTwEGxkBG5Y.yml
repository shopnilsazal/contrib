recordingDate: 1415985978
description: "By, Lena Reinhard\nThis talk will take you on a journey â€“ from the days of the Easter Islands in the southeastern Pacific Ocean around 700CE, over the mid-15th century in England to Mars, rain forests and coral reefs of our days. On our way, we'll think about the relevance of Open Source Software technology-wise, see why the software we build is a hybrid and which impact this hybridism has on what we build and how. We'll think about Open Source Software's core values, and find out in which terms aiming for diversity (regarding gender, skills, ethnicities and ideas / backgrounds), user-centered approaches, democracy, decentralization and language will be core values when we're building the future of Open Source.\n\nThis talk aims to encourage everyone of us to broaden our horizons when it comes to how far we can go collectively with all our Open Source projects when we're thinking about the future, - and it will show how widening our communities, aiming for diversity, sustainability and attracting new contributours to our projects will enable us to make this future a bright and great one together.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Faei/"
