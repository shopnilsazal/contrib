description: "Applications and systems are written by developers. It’s a tough job, when you think about it. You try to fulfill the business requirements to make the users happy, you try to write clear code to make your fellow colleagues content, you try to make the whole thing scalable, maintainable and extensible for whatever the reason might be. On top of it you still need to make the system secure.\n\nBut what does “secure” actually mean? Where does security actually start and when do we stop and say that “security is ready”? How can you test that implemented security controls actually work? Are you able to deliver security fast? What’s the latest state of the art regarding what needs to be done?\n\nIf you want to know the answer to at least one of the questions, feel invited to join the talk. We will speak about crypto, security headers, injection, dealing with third party code, authentication and access control and many, many more."
