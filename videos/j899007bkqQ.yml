recordingDate: 1508455066
description: 'This presentation will walk audience through and explain recently developed Kismet features that greatly benefit multiple radio cards setup. Support for multiple devices allows smarter splitting across them, including separate discovery and tracking activities, as well as dedicating certain radios to targeted bands and channels ranges. Coming Kismet release (currently under development, slated to be released shortly) has new and very flexible configuration options targeting utilization of multiple sources of radio data during passive scan and tracking. Live presentation will use ALFTEL Systems Ltd. Airbud appliance with x8 radio cards setup and latest Kismet sniffer software.'
