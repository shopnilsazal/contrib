description: 'There''s a shortage of people that you can hire. There are problems to find promising, good or even proper candidates when you want to recruit. You are getting more and more certain, that education in the universities are not enough. Or perhaps you would even phrase it harsher. You''re not the only one, I talked with boys and girls thinking whether after lyc√©e or tech-school they should go straight to work, ''for studies are useless''. And because you (or your team, or your boss, or your company) have problems with letting people go, you''re afraid of saying ''YES'' to the candidate, unless you''re really convinced (as you should!). Solution: hire and teach them yourself. Last year I prepared and led a Java Academy program. I was hired just to do it. Rules were simple: interview, choose most promising ones, teach them for 3 months interspersed with mock interviews to gauge progress. Program was repeated. Afterwards, I used variation of it to introduce manual testers to Java. During this presentation, you will learn: - what I did, - what worked, - what failed to work, despite seemingly having no reasons to, - what you need to do to have such a program (and why), - how taxing that is. And I''m hoping for a good QnA session!'
