description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Hugo Visser, Little Robots.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-51\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/hugovisser/up-close-and-personal-with-nearby\n\nNearby is a set of APIs that allow you to add features based on proximity in your app. Using these APIs you can share messages, create real-time connections between other devices, and receive messages associated with Bluetooth beacons in the real world.\n\nIn this talk we'll go over the three components of Nearby: Notifications, Messages and Connections, their characteristics and related tools. Weâ€™ll of course take a look at the recently updated APIs that make Nearby tick. You'll learn what the different Nearby features are and how you can use them in your apps. There will be plenty of code samples and taunting of the demo gods to show you what Nearby has to offer.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
