title: 'Chou-han Yang - Briefly - A Python DSL to Scale Complex Mapreduce Pipelines'
recordingDate: 1430495052
description: "PyData Dallas 2015\n\"Briefly, a open-source project designed to tackle the challenge of simultaneously handling the flow of Hadoop and non-Hadoop tasks. In short, Briefly is a Python-based, meta-programming job-flow control engine for big data processing pipelines. We called it Briefly because it provides us with a way to describe complex data processing flows in a very concise way. At BloomReach, we have hundreds of Hadoop clusters running with different applications at any given time. From parsing HTML pages and creating indexes to aggregating page visits, we all rely on Hadoop for our day to day work. The job sounds simple, but the challenge is to handle complex operational issues without compromising code quality, as well as the ability to control a group of Hadoop clusters to maximize efficiency.\""
