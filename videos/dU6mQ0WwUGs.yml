description: "By Arne Brasseur\n\nWith the rise of mobile phones and browsers as application platforms, web API's are something we simply can't get around anymore.\nThe world, and the web, is changing as we speak, and people are scrambling to figure out how best to build their services.\n\nHaving watched this evolution from its early days, and having consumed and built API's of various flavors, I want to take a moment to trace Web Services back to their humble RPC roots.\n\nFrom there we'll follow Fielding through a landscape of REST and Hypermedia, to arrive at a marvelous vista of connected services in a world of computing that is always-on and always-online.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG30/"
