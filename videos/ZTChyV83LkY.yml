description: "Mobile VR, like desktop VR, comes with a set of unique design challenges. This 2015 talk from Oculus' Chris Pruett discusses the challenges and benefits of targeting mobile VR platforms, and explains in detail how mobile developers can approach this new platform. This talk is focused on specific design considerations for mobile VR, the decisions made by Pruett's company Robot Invader on the game Dead Secret, tips and tricks we learned along the way, and how we might do it differently in the future.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
