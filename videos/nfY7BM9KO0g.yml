description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nChaos Engineering WG Intro – Sylvain Hellegouarch, ChaosIQ (Any Skill Level)\n\nPropelled by years of success at Netflix, Chaos Engineering has recently seen a quick uptake as a critical discipline, for engineers and organizations, to keep a strong level of familiarity of production systems, as these are growing in complexity.Characteristics of Cloud Native systems (resilient, dynamic, isolation of concerns, automation, observability) lend themselves naturally to the chaos engineering discipline. This session is about introducing a new CNCF WG to achieve a strong community of practices, and potential API, that should benefit users when they want to apply Chaos Engineering.\n\nAbout Sylvain\nSylvain Hellegouarch is the CTO and lead engineer at ChaosIQ. He has been passionnate about Open Source for as long as he can remember working on various successful Python projects (CherryPy, WebSocket 4 Python and more recently, the Chaos Toolkit). He has participated to IETF working groups such as the WebSocket (RFC 6455) and Atom Publishing protocols (RFC 4287). He has worked on companies of various size and loves a great team to learn from."
