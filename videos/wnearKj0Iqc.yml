description: "Antonin Lacombe - From basic distance search to a complex multi criteria search\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nThis case study show how to start from a simple distance search on\nelasticsearch and haystack and implement a production ready search\nlike airbnb.\nThe talk will explain decay functions works with the different curves\n(linear, exponential, gauss) and how to send them with query scores to\nelasticsearch. With that you will be able to mix the distance, the\nprice, the user activity, the number of picture and whatever you want.\n\n\nAdditionally I will show how to write a custom\nElasticsearchSearchQuery and ElasticsearchSearchBackend because this\nis not yet supported by haybtacksearch.\n\nAll the code is available here https://github.com/JeLoueMonCampingCar\n/haystack-function-score-backend.git"
