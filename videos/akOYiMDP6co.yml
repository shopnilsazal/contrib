description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2017 by Chad Schultz, SpotHero.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-26\nSlides link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Dblfk4lL2dh79EQFJ5AeT7Ur0nZJPz7dXkOwwrcMIXM/edit?usp=sharing\n\nWhat if… - you could share a meeting agenda, link, or access to a document to a roomful of people without having to enter their email addresses? - you could collaborate seamlessly with a group of people on a proposal, lunch order or crowdgame just by being in the same room? - when you walked up to a locked door, it knew you were there and unlocked for you without having to pull out an ID card? - you could navigate to your parked car in a huge concrete garage as easily as you could navigate across town with GPS?\n\nAll of these concepts, and many more, are possible thanks to the Nearby API. Before, it was often easier to have one phone talk to another around the world than one in the same room. Now the Nearby API greatly simplifies the process of proximity-based communication between phones, and of working with beacons. It’s easy for you to become a pro at handling proximity in your apps!\n\nWe’ll go over ideas of what the Nearby API can add to your app, how to implement it, and what Google doesn’t tell you about the Nearby API. We’ll also be able to try some apps hands-on together to see the potential firsthand! There will be a smorgasbord of interesting information. Bon app-etit!\n\nType: Android development\nExperience: intermediate\n\nAlex Karp Production"
