description: "The major change in JDK 9 is the Java Platform Module System (also known as project Jigsaw). With the encapsulation of internal APIs such as sun.misc.Unsafe migrating applications to JDK 9 will potentially require more work than moving between releases previously.\n\nIn this session, we’ll look at all the areas of JDK 9 that may impact application migration. This will cover all aspects: Java language syntax, class libraries and JVM options (a significant number of which have changed in JDK 9). Unlike previous Java releases, several features, which were in JDK 8, have been removed. These will also be discussed in terms of backward compatibility.\n\nWe’ll also look at the new release cadence for the JDK and explain how this affects support for Java, which will affect choices of which Java versions to use in production."
