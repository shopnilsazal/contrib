description: "Every site based on a RDBMS will eventually hit a database scalability bottleneck. In this session we will introduce Hypertable, an open-source implementation of BigTable, and HyperRecord, an extension of ActiveRecord using Hypertable for storage. We will demonstrate Zvents' use of these technologies to scale a high-traffic, data-intensive consumer web application, writing billions of cells daily.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGeI/"
