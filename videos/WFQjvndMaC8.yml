description: "Life on the Edge by: James Edward Gray II\n\nWe are probably all familiar with the dreaded edge cases that creep up on our production code and sucker punch it with inputs we never expected. I bet most of us have scrambled to fix those at one time or another.\nThe good news is that you don't have to live in fear of edge cases. In fact, you can turn the tables and force them to work for you. That's a technique I have used quite successfully in my own programming for many years now. It can help you to have better conversations with your clients, design smarter code, choose better processing strategies, and even luck into the right algorithms.\nIn this talk, I'll explain how I use edge case thinking, explain what it can do for you, and show several examples of how it leads to better choices. You will learn how to stop \"slurping\" data (even with SQL), how to shed your fear of nil returns and how to avoid spreading that fear to others, how to think synchronously but still get an asynchronous advantage, and more."
