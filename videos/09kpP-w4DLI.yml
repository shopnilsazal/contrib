description: 'Deep ML Architecture at Wildcard: At Wildcard we think about technologies for a future native mobile web experience through cards. Cards are a new UI paradigm for content on mobile for which we schematize unstructured web content. Part of the challenge is to develop an understanding of online content through machine learning algorithms. The extracted information is used to create cards that are surfaced in the Wildcard iOS app and in other card ecosystems. I will describe the challenge and the way we structure the problem of content extraction with a deep architecture of classification and optimization algorithms that combines traditionally factorized problems of content extraction which allows the various stages to inform each other. The talk will include an overview of the used data, features and our training strategy with a partly human-powered labeling system. This ML system, called sic, is used in production and I will show our approach to using only fast or a mix of fast and slow features depending on the use case in the app.'
