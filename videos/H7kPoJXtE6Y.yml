Your Internet…habits are only for you to know, not ISPs, hotels, government agencies, your neighbor, that creepy guy down the street with the cantenna, or anyone else. With your privacy in mind; we’ve combined two things every good hacker should have, a Propeller powered DEF CON badge (DC XX in our case) and a somewhat sober brain to turn the DC badge (with some modifications) into an inline network encryption device. This modified badge, loving called the PropLANE, will allow you to keep your peer-to-peer network traffic away from the prying eyes of the aforementioned creepy guy down the street and impress all the cool hacker peoples of the gender you prefer.\n\nEvilrob is a Security Engineer with over 13 years of experience with large network architecture and security engineering. His current focus is on network security architecture, tool development, and high-assurance encryption devices. He spends his waking moments contemplating new and terrible ways to make and break things as the Overlord of Engineering at Peak Security.\n\nPhorkus is the starry eyed Chief Scientist of Peak Security, and a long time goon at DEF CON. He bends bits to his will, and dismays audiences with his whimsical narrations of physics, organic nutrition, and what it means to be god. He will amaze and astound. He's also very likely to confuse.\n\nRussr is a security expert with over 20 years of experience, and has been an active member of the DEF CON community and staff for the past 17 years. He's the CEO and co-founder of Peak Security.\n\nLosTboY is the puzzle master and badge lord for DEF CON. He's a coder, a hacker, and a fancy dresser. LosT is well known for his exploits, including the popular Mystery Box Challenge, and the amazing DEF CON badges.\n\nsite: www.peaksec.com \nFB: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Peak-Security-Inc/195202587160074 \nTwitter: @PeakSec"
