I'll talk about the tools for\ncode analysis, differences between them, extending them with new\nfeatures and ways to running them automatically. In the end, I'll talk\nabout reasons behind all of these tools and try to convince you to\nusing them in your projects (but if you are against it - I'll gladly\nlisten to your arguments)."
