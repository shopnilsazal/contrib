title: 'Monitoring Microservice Applications Is About Visibility — And It Isn’t'
recordingDate: 1527021243
description: "Why Understanding Data (not just collecting it) is Necessary to Deliver High Performance Dynamic Applications.\n\nWhen new technology platforms appear, new application monitoring solutions also emerge to provide application and platform visibility. Dynamic containerized microservice applications are no different – monitoring performance first requires visibility, which is why it’s nice that open source standards like OpenTracing and Jaeger have appeared. Unfortunately, just collecting the tracing data is no longer enough. These new applications are so complex and dynamic that the most important aspect of monitoring is how pieces fit together, correlating information from multiple data sources. We’ll explore the pros and cons of different monitoring technologies, look at the challenges of monitoring new microservice applications, and dig into how to best use the vast monitoring data now available to deliver optimum application performance."
