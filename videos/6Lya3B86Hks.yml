description: "Description from DEF CON 9 Speakerâ€™s Page: \nPolymorphic shellcode API\n\nPolymorphism has been around for years in the form of virus attacks.\_ There is a wealth of information pertaining to this.\_ This presentation will concern itself with the implementation of an API designed to place some black-box code (probably shellcode) within an encoded structure and deliver it against a number of Architectures (SPARC,HP,IA32,more soon).\_\n\nThis code has been tested thoroughly against a number of popular NIDS Sensors (ISS, snort, dragon, NFR, ), and has proven that as of yet, the code itself can NOT be detected at all.\_ There are some possible methods of detection and that will be analyzed and future modifications to further evade these measures.\n\nK2 is a security consultant for a major multi-national company, personally located in Vancouver, Canada.\_ Spare time spent mostly investigating OS/Network vulnerabilities and the exploitation there of :)\_ Years of assembly experience and a well developed cross-platform knowledge base."
