description: "Uber Engineering discusses how we rewrote our mobile architecture to grow our apps at scale. In this presentation, we discuss how we implemented the same core architectural concepts across both iOS and Android and used a RIBs (Router-Interactor-Builder) pattern, deep scope hierarchies, and plugins to form the backbone of our mobile infrastructure.\n\nFor more info see: https://eng.uber.com \n\n===================================================\nMore on the Uber Engineering Mobility Meetups Series\nhttps://www.uber.com/p/uber-mobility/\n\nWelcome to Uber Mobility, a meetup series focused on building scalable, high-quality mobile applications. The platform-agnostic topics today will help you build better mobile applications at scale for a global market.\n\nChoosing the right architecture for your mobile architecture has a long-lasting effect on the productivity of your team and the reliable extensibility of your application. Bad architectural decisions might not immediately be obvious, but will affect the entire team for years to come.\n\nDuring our Fourth Uber Mobility Meetup, we’ll run you through why we decided to create a new architecture and how we managed to rewrite and launch Uber’s rider app with this new architecture in record time. We’ll talk through the core principles of the new architecture and why we think it’s a perfect fit for creating reliable, highly maintainable mobile applications, especially when you’re working at scale and have a large mobile team.\n\nMore on Uber Engineering Events:https://www.meetup.com/pro/Uber/"
