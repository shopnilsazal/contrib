In this GDC 2014 talk, Drinkbox Studios' Augusto Quijano gives insight into the development process of Guacamelee!, and how the team created a Mexico that feels authentic. \nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
