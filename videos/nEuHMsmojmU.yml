description: "Type System Tips for the Real World by Sean Griffin\n\nHave you ever looked at some of the more exotic capabilities of Rust's type system and wondered “why”? Why on earth would I ever want a zero sized type? How do I efficiently implement a deeply recursive type? Just what do monomorphization and type erasure actually mean?\n\nIn this talk we'll look at some real world examples from inside Diesel to answer these questions and more. You'll come away from this talk with a stronger understanding of how to use Rust's generics, traits, and exotically sized types."
