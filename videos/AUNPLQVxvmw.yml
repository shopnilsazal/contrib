But that is only half of the work that needs to be done. During this presentation Maciej, who co-authored both Job and CronJob controllers, and is a frequent reviewer of controller and apiserver-related code will guide you through basic set of steps that are necessary to write a simple controller. As an example he will discuss his recent work around improving CronJob controller, as well as introduce the 11 rules that needs to be fulfilled when writing a good controller. Topics to be covered include: 1. How controllers work, loop over:* monitor resources * react to changes 2. Shared Informers. 3. Owner references. 4. Emitting status. 5. Handling errors.\n\nAbout Maciej\nMaciej is a passionate developer with over 10 years of experience in many languages. He's working on OpenShift and Kubernetes for Red Hat.
