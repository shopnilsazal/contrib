description: "Your Rails app is full of data that can (and should!) be turned into useful information with some simple machine learning technqiues. We'll look at basic techniques that are both immediately applicable and the foundation for more advanced analysis -- starting with your Users table.\n\nWe will cover the basics of assigning users to categories, segmenting users by behavior, and simple recommendation algorithms.
