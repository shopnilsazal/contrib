The project is still ongoing. During the build-out of the kubernetes clusters that are going to power the services responsible for Wikipedia, there were a number of interesting decisions that had to be takenr regarding the networking implementation, the routing of external traffic, the chosen bootstrap method for the clusters and the building methodology for containers and last but not least the transition plan from the old style services to the kubernetes style services. This talk is about sharing these implementation decisions with a wider public\n\nAbout Alexandros\nA Linux sysadmin, turned FreeBSD sysadmin, turned Linux sysadmin, turned systems engineer (somewhere along that path there's a Devops hat as well), Alexandros has been in the space since 1999, starting as a hobbyist, then a professional. Currently working with the Wikimedia Foundation, he has pushed forward for more virtualization and better orchestrated microservices and environments for their execution. The kubernetes project is a current passion.\n\nAbout Giuseppe\nI am a Site Reliability Engineer for your favourite free encycolopedia. I love to model and improve large, distributed systems, and to abstract complexity away from the individual developers, and my work from the individual hardware parts it relies on. Kubernetes seems like the natural environment where to make that happen."
