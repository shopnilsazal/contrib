description: "by Richard Brown\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nRolling Releases are the future of Linux distributions. They are already thebetter solution for power users & developers. The methodologies, techniques,and capabilities of Tumbleweed are opening up new doors, creatingpossibilities, and disrupting existing technologies beyond its borders. Thissession will explain how and why openSUSE Tumbleweed is paving the way forthat future, while already being \"the reliable rolling release\". The talk willdispel the fears, uncertainties and doubts that many have regarding rollingreleases in general and Tumbleweed specifically, and share how you can getinvolved both using, and improving, this exciting fast moving foundation ofthe openSUSE Project.\n\nThe audience is anyone interested in using recent versions of the Linux kernelor other upstream projects. This includes not only enthusiasts, butdevelopers, especially Linux kernel developers and other developers of fastmoving stacks who often benefit from having a stable platform with all thelatest libraries and binaries available to them. Attendees can expect to get asolid understanding of how Tumbleweed is developed, it's strengths andbenefits, as well as a comparison with Tumbleweed to other similar Linux-basedrolling distributions. This presentation will encourage a broader adoption ofrolling releases and the mentality, methodologies and capabilities that comewith it. Tumbleweed and other similar rolling releases are key platforms toenable the high speed development of the Linux kernel and other key ecosystemcomponents which increasingly move at a faster pace than 'traditional' Linuxdistributions can keep up. Rolling releases are also the natural platform fornot only the development but the early adoption of key emerging technologiessuch as Containerisation and NFV.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 09:30:00"
