description: "343 Industries was formed with a monumental task: to build a new studio from scratch and take over a much beloved universe from legendary developer Bungie. Their first internally developed title, Halo 4, was released on November 6, 2012. In his GDC 2013 talk, franchise creative director Josh Holmes discusses how the studio managed to overcome the challenges involved with assembling a brand new team to deliver a game worthy of the Halo franchise legacy.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
