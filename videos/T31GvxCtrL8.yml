description: "by Daniel Stenberg\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThousands of contributors help building the curl software which runs onseveral billions of devices and are affecting every human in the connectedworld daily. How this came to happen, who contributes and how Daniel at thewheel keeps it all together.\n\nThis is a description of a small project with a major reach. curl and libcurlcan probably be considered corner stones in a world of client-side Internettransfers and in particular HTTP, running on every imaginable operating systemand CPU architecture in use today. Started in the late 90s, the software nowruns in billions of devices and is quite likely one of the most widely usedsoftware components - any category. Daniel takes us through how it started,how it works and why it never gets done.\n\n\nRoom: Janson\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 13:00:00"
