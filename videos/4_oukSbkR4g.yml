description: "DEF CON 16 - Alexander Lash: Taking Back your Cellphone\n\nThis presentation will cover a variety of topics of interest to anyone on a cellphone network in the US. I'm going to cover how to use your own backends for MMS and WAP access, unlock Bluetooth tethering, and circumvent some of the more obnoxious carrier restrictions.\nOf course, the best part is baking your own firmware and running your own code. I'll provide an overview of the processes necessary to do so, a quick rundown of what you can expect from your carrier, a few tools and docs I've assembled to take a little pain out of the process, and all of the information you'll need to void your warranty with gusto and panache.\n\nI'll provide several demonstrations you can follow along with on your own phone. The more restricted your phone is, the more mileage you'll get out of this talk --- and one lucky audience member will have their warranty voided live!\n\nAlexander Lash has been tampering with cellular phones for ten years and putting together mobile applications for four. He's been putting together tools and docs while taking apart firmware and carrier systems, and takes personal offense at the idea of not being able to write code for his own hardware. (Pay no attention to the fact that he's left a trail of dead phones in his wake.) \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
