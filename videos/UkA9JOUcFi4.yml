description: 'One of the huge criticisms of Security research is the lack of process and adherence to traditional research methods. Quite often our "research" is just tearing apart systems and exposing their vulnerabilities. While this is useful, there is a better way. This talk will walk through the process of how I used the scientific method to conduct the research that led to my 2011 insulin pump findings. By changing just a couple steps in our research, I think that we can bring more outside credibility to our hard, and important work.'
