description: "\"GPFS Native RAID for 100,000-Disk Petascale Systems\", by Veera Deenadhayalan, IBM Almaden Research Center\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this video are those of the speaker(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the USENIX Association.**\r\n\r\nGPFS (General Parallel File System) is widely used in HPC systems and GPFS. Native RAID (GNR) is a newly added, robust RAID layer tightly integrated into GPFS. GNR effectively utilizes the multiple CPU cores of modern IO servers to eliminate the hardware cost, firmware hassles, and maintenance associated with standalone RAID controllers. To effectively deal with a 100,000-disk petascale system that is expected to experience disk failures on a daily basis, GNR uses declustered RAID to lower the impact of RAID rebuild operations, 3-fault-tolerant redundancy codes, comprehensive asynchronous disk diagnostics, and end-to-end checksum protection to meet the cost, reliability, and integrity goals of the system."
