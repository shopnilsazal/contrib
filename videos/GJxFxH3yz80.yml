description: "by: Erin O'Brien\n\nIn this talk, I will aim to address some issues about the low number of women in the field. I will base my discussion on current research trends, mainly from the field of Psychology, to discuss why there arenâ€™t more female programmers and what can be done to successfully recruit/retain more women. I will provide real-world examples of what women experience and pair those with simple solutions that men (and women) can employ to decrease the gender imbalance."
