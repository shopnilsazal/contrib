description: 'The topic is a real eye-opener. For several decades software development was managed in a way primarily developed for manufacture during the industrial revolution. It is deeply broken and not integrating with creative nature of software developers. Therefore disruptive companies are winning markets with giants all over the world. They focus on individuals, understanding that people are by far the most important ingredient of the success. Applying this knowledge to software development, we''re given a powerful (anti)management system for teams to innovate, disrupt and be super effective.'
