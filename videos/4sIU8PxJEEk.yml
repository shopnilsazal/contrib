title: 'RailsConf 2014 - Class Reloading in Ruby on Rails: The Whole Story by Xavier Noria'
recordingDate: 1400801894
description: "Ruby on Rails applications do not need to require the files that define their classes and modules. In development mode, code changes take effect without restarting the server. How's that possible? This talk explains how this works in depth.\n\nYou'll come out with a deep understanding of how constants work in Ruby, constant autoloading in Rails, how and why does it differ from Ruby's builtin algorithms, and how class reloading is implemented.\n\nXavier Noria is an everlasting student and father of the most wonderful girl. An independent Ruby on Rails consultant from Barcelona, Xavier is a member of the Ruby on Rails core team, Ruby Hero 2010, and proud author of Rails Contributors.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGZm/"
