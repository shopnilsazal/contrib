description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nThe Untapped Power of Services - L7 Load Balancing Without a Service Mesh - Damien Lespiau, Weaveworks (Advanced Skill Level)\n\nAt Weaveworks, we sometimes need more than the L3/L4 load balancing offered today with the Service abstraction. The Kubernetes Service &amp; Endpoint objects have some extraordinary untapped powers: they can be used to build artisanal, high-level load balancing and session affinity schemes. This talk will go through a few examples: sharding across endpoints based on a layer 7 key, master endpoint election and demonstrate a tiny reverse proxy implementing service affinity using consistent hashing with bounded load.\n\nAbout Damien\nDamien has spent way too much time playing with Linux over the past 20 years. He has worked on all sorts of embedded products, is a GNOME contributor, has spend 4 years in the Linux kernel making Intel GPUs behave and is now working at Weaveworks, helping defining what the future of containers looks like."
