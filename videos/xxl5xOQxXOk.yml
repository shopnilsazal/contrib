description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://gsec.hitb.org/materials/sg2015/\n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\nThe number of vulnerabilities in firmware disclosed as affecting Wintel PC vendors has been rising over the past few years. Although several attacks have been presented against Mac firmware, unlike their PC counterparts, all of them required physical presence to perform. Interestingly, when contacted with the details of previously disclosed PC firmware attacks, Apple systematically declared themselves not vulnerable.\n\nThis talk will provide conclusive evidence that Macâ€™s are in fact vulnerable to many of the software only firmware attacks that also affect PC systems. In addition, to emphasize the consequences of successful exploitation of these attack vectors, we will demonstrate the power of the dark side by showing what Mac firmware malware is capable of.\n\nABOUT XENO KOVAH\n\nXeno Kovah is a co-founder of LegbaCore, a consultancy focused on evaluating and improving host security at the lowest levels. His specialty area is stealth malware and its ability to hide from security software and force security software to lie. To combat such attacks he researches trusted computing systems that can provide much stronger security guarantees than normal COTS. Xeno is also the founder and lead contributor to OpenSecurityTraining.info. He has posted 9 days of class material material on x86 assembly, architecture, binary formats (PE and ELF), and Windows rootkits. He has presented at BlackHat USA/EUR, IEEE S&P, ACM CCS, Defcon, CanSecWest, PacSec, HITB KUL, Microsoft BlueHat, Shmoocon, Hack.lu, NoSuchCon, SummerCon, ToorCon, DeepSec, VirusBulletin, MIRCon, AusCERT, and others."
