description: "by David Teller\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nLet's see how we can build small IoT devices that can help blind people intheir daily life.\n\nThe Word Health Organization estimates that more than 250 million peoplesuffer from vision impairment, 36 millions of them being entirely blind. Inmany cases, their impairment prevents them from living independently. Tocomplicate things further, about 90% of them are estimated to live in low-income situations.\n\nProject Lighthouse was started by Mozilla to try and find low-costtechnological solutions that can help vision-impaired people live and functionon their own. To this date, we have produced several prototypes designed toaid users in a variety of situations.\n\nLet's look at some of them.\n\nThis will be a relatively low-tech presentation.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 15:00:00"
