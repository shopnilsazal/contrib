description: "Abstract\nWriting test cases is laborious, often a little neglected, and ultimately rather unsatisfying, since errors slip through even the most comprehensive test suites. Can we generate tests instead? In this talk I’ll show test case generation using QuickCheck, drawing on experience of applying it at scale at Quviq. I’ll try to explain why property-based testing can be so effective, and how to use it most effectively.\n\nBio\nI am a professor at the Computing Science Department at Chalmers University of Technology, and a member of the Functional Programming Group. I am also CEO at Quviq AB, which offers a commercial version of QuickCheck, where I spend half of my time."
