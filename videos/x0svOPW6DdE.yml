description: "PyData Dallas 2015\nBlaze is a library for harnessing the power of big data technologies. We show motivating use cases illustrating why you might want to use blaze, including a comparison of out-of-core pandas to other backends designed to scale both horizontally and vertically. Time permitting, we'll show how easy it is for users of blaze to scratch their own itch by hooking an existing API into blaze via a small set of multiply dispatched functions."
