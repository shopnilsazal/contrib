title: 'Designing Monument Valley: Less Game, More Experience'
recordingDate: 1431706978
description: 'In this talk given at GDC Europe 2014, Monument Valley lead designer Ken Wong talks about how the impossible art of M.C. Escher and being embedded in a UX studio led ustwo games to create a chart-topping game in which every screen was a piece of art. He discusses how rethinking games as user experiences inspired the team to trade challenging puzzles for an aesthetic journey, and why keeping that journey short but sublime won the game new audiences.'
