description: "Felix \"FX\" Lindner - Blitzableiter - the Release\nThe talk presents a simple but effective approach for securing Rich Internet Application (RIA) content before using it. Focusing on Adobe Flash content, the security threats presented by Flash movies are discussed, as well as their inner workings that allow such attacks to happen. Some of those details will make you laugh, some will make you wince. Based on the properties discussed, the idea behind the defense approach will be presented, as well as the code implementing it and the results of using it in the real world.\n\nAfter a year of development, we hope to release a working tool to the world, so you can apply the defense technique to your web browser.\n\nFelix \"FX\" Lindner runs Recurity Labs, a security consulting and research company in Berlin, Germany.
