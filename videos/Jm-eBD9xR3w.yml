title: 'Trent McConaghy - Driving Moore''s Law with Python-Powered Machine Learning: An Insider''s Perspective'
recordingDate: 1406375938
description: "View slides for this presentation here:\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/PyData/py-data-berlin-trent-mcconaghy-moores-law\n\nPyData Berlin 2014 \nPeople talk about a Moore's Law for gene sequencing, a Moore's Law for software, etc. This is talk is about *the* Moore's Law, the bull that the other \"Laws\" ride; and how Python-powered ML helps drive it. How do we keep making ever-smaller devices? How do we harness atomic-scale physics? Large-scale machine learning is key. The computation drives new chip designs, and those new chip designs are used for new computations, ad infinitum. High-dimensional regression, classification, active learning, optimization, ranking, clustering, density estimation, scientific visualization, massively parallel processing -- it all comes into play, and Python is powering it all."
