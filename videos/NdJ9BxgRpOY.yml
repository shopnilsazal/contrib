description: "PyData NYC 2015\n\nOver Python's long history it has collected a large number of implementations, both active and abandoned (Wikipedia lists 10 implementations alone). This talk will go over the actively maintained implementations of Python, what makes them unique, and end with an unscientific performance comparison (both Python 2 & 3 interpreters).\n\nActively maintained interpreters\nCPython\nPyPy\nIronPython\nJython\n\nInterpreters under development\nSkython?\nPyston\nPyjion\n\nInterpreters that have ceased to be\nToo many to list individually\n\nOther ways to get a performance boost\nNumba\nCython\n\nPerformance comparison\nAn exploration of performance using CPython's benchmark suite. Data will be made publicly available through a Jupyter notebook.\n\nSlides available here:  http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/brettcannon/9d19cc184ea45b3e7ca0"
