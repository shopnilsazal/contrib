description: "by Christophe Lafon-Roudier (Pouhiou)\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nBig data companies (aka GAFAM) have centralized our services, our data and ourdigital lives. Over the last two years, the French non-profit organizationFramasoft has been demonstrating that FLOSS can be used as an ethical anduser-respecting alternative to widespread services such as Dropbox, Skype,Facebook, Google Agenda, or even Minecraft. Time has now come to share thisexperience so that it can spread into a network of data-friendly and user-respectful service hosters.\n\n2016 is a milestone: Google Apple Facebook Amazon and Microsoft (also known asGAFAM) are now ranked as the 5 largest companies by market capitalization inthe USA. Big Data has become more important and powerful than Big Oil or BigPharma. Web centralization, profiling advertisement, government enablement tocarry out mass-surveillance, shrinking diversity and innovation, and evenbevahioural hijacking: here are only a few of the numerous issues that arisewith these huge centralizede powers\n\nEven though a wider audience is becoming aware of these issues, their answeris always the same: \"What else can I use?\"\n\nFramasoft is a small French non-profit association whose aim is to promoteFree-Libre software and culture to the general public through practicalprojects: a Free-Libre software directory, a user-friendly USB stick filledwith portable FLOSS, a publishing house for Free-Libre booksâ€¦ In October 2014,we made public this impossible challenge: over the next 3 years, we wouldprovide Mr. and Mrs. Everyone with more than 30 alternatives to the main GAFAMservices, all based upon Free-Libre and Open-Source softwares while respectingthe users privacy. We aimed at a triple goal : to inform the general audienceof the stakes, to provide viable alternative as a proof of concept tomainstream users, and to spread this experience by promoting self-hosting andhelping other data-friendly services hosters to grow.\n\nMore than two years later, a wider audience is being aware of the data-centralization issues. We are on track to win our bet since only a fewservices remain to be launched. We are currently initiating CHATONS, a networkbringing together hosters who respect privacy and provide ethical services.\n\nHere is the story of what we did and how we did it. We would be thrilled ifour experience could be useful to non-French speaking projects andcommunities.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:00:00"
