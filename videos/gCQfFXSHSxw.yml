description: "Keynote: Kubernetes: This Job is Too Hard: Building New Tools, Patterns and Paradigms to Democratize Distributed System Development - Brendan Burns, Distinguished Engineer, Microsoft\n\nThe simple truth is that there are more reliable online systems that need to be built then there are people who know how to build them. Building a distributed system is bespoke, manual and hard.\n\nFortunately, with the development of containers and Kubernetes, a foundation has been created for a new type of development environment to make building systems dramatically easier and more modular. But containers and Kubernetes, while necessary, are not sufficient. In this talk I introduce Metaparticle, a new standard library for easy distributed systems development on Kubernetes.\n\nMetaparticle uses familiar, standard programming languages to enable developers and architects to design, develop and deploy their application from a single, easy to use environment.\n\nAbout Brendan Burns\nBrendan Burns is a software engineer at Microsoft Azure and co-founder of the Kubernetes project. Before Kubernetes he worked on search infrastructure at Google. Before Google he was a professor at Union College in Schenectady, NY. He received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and his BA in Computer Science and Studio Art from Williams College."
