description: "Abstract\nCreating User Interfaces has traditionally been a mostly imperative matter and building UIs in a functional way has never really been easy. In this talk weâ€™ll learn how to build UIs using only pure functions with the help of Reactive Programming and Scala.js or PureScript. We will take a look at the strengths and weaknesses of each languages, explore OutWatch, a new UI Library based on Rx, look at what works well, identify more challenging tasks and unlock the full potential of functional design and type safety with functional programming in the browser.\n\nBio\nLuka Jacobowitz is a Software Consultant at codecentric focusing on functional and reactive programming. Always interested in trying new things and lover of all things open source. He is the author of the reactive UI library https://outwatch.github.io and you can find his cv at http://stackoverflow.com/cv/lukajacobowitzc and his blog under http://lukajcb.github.io/blog."
