description: "By Steven Haddox\n\nEveryone casts the \"Enterprise\" as the most horrid place in the world to be a Ruby developer, and they used to be right. How does a Rubyist trying to stay current work in a confined and archaic environment with strict security restrictions? You do everything other Rubyists do, but you do it without sudo and from source. Together we'll identify the \n\nbest open source self-hosted options for agile managment, provisioning, git hosting, error tracking, CI, isolated RVM, metrics, central logging, and security. As a bonus, you'll learn how to automate the setup of all these tools as much as possible without sudo privileges.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG63/"
