description: "Copy of the slides for this talk are here:https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Maletic-Pogue/DEFCON-20-Maletic-Pogue-OPFOR4Ever.pdf \n\nOPFOR 4Ever\nTim Maletic Senior Security Consultant,Trustwave SpiderLabs\nChristopher Pogue Managing Consultant, Trustwave SpiderLabs\n\nTraining utilizing Opposing Forces, or OPFOR, is an exercise focused on improving detection and response through the principle of \"train as you fight.\" We will demonstrate how we have applied OPFOR to build a continuous feedback loop between penetration testing and incident response. In OPFOR 4Ever, the defense trains the offense just as much as the offense trains the defense, and the exercise has no end date. Come see us demonstrate some attacks as seen from the point of view of the defender as well as the attacker. You can then watch the replay as we use OPFOR principles to evolve these attacks to a form more suitable for real-world penetration testing, pentesting that strives to better simulate what blackhats actually do. This of course raises the bar for incident responders. Evolve or die.\n\nTim Maletic is a Senior Security Consultant within the Penetration Testing team at Trustwave's SpiderLabs. Tim has been working in IT since the birth of the web, and has been focused full-time on information security since 2001.
