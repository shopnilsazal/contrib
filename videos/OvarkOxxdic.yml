title: '#HITB2017AMS D2T1 - Everybody Wants SOME: Advance Same Origin Method Execution - Ben Hayak'
recordingDate: 1494720228
description: "SOME – “Same Origin Method Execution” is a new technique (2 years since its first big exposure) that abuses callback endpoints in order to perform a limitless number of unintended actions on a website on behalf of users, by assembling a malicious set of timed iframes and/or windows.\n\nThe attack was proven against vast platforms such as WordPress and various web applications built by Google, Paypal, Microsoft and etc. This attack is not UI related nor it is confined in terms of user interaction, browser brand, HTTP X-FRAME-OPTIONS/Other response headers or a particular webpage, in fact, when a webpage found vulnerable to “SOME”, the entire domain becomes vulnerable.\n\nDuring this talk I intend to show and demonstrate the cleverest SOME attacks performed against real case scenarios, in addition I will demo a XSS attacks that became possible ONLY after using the SOME technique. I am going to emphasize the advance aspects of the SOME attack including a new approach in terms of interaction, in addition I am going to clarify some queries and confusions that were raised after the exposure of SOME in relation to JSONP.\n\nThis talk will show you how web pages used as callback endpoints open a backdoor, even in the most protected domains, to a very powerful attack that can cause severe damage.\n\n=== \n\nBen Hayak is an Information Security Engineer and (mostly at night) researcher. His main interests are reverse engineering, web application security and client-server security. He has quite  a few years of experience with Assembler/Assembly language, debugging, and programming and has three years of data communications experience with CCNA & CCNP Route qualifications. He also has experience in surveying the penetrability of data systems and providing practical solutions for organizations. Currently, he works as a Product Security Leader at Salesforce. His expertise includes reviewing, isolating, analyzing, and reverse-engineering programs that are vulnerable or malicious code in order to determine and develop protection against the specific nature of the threat. He was also one of the Top 0xA list of security researchers on Google security list for ~2 years."
