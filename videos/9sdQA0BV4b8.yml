description: "Lonestar ElixirConf 2017- Raspberry Pi Cluster with the Power of Elixir by Ricardo Echavarria\n\nElixir is an elegant and powerful language. This makes the Raspberry Pi a usable server for Elixir Applications. What would happen if we had a cluster of Raspberry Pi devices? Can Elixir and OTP help with the distribution of the application? What would you do with a 16 core and 4 GB of RAM machine?\n\nIâ€™ll explore different techniques to deploy to a Raspberry Pi Cluster and how we can use the Elixir processes to balance the load between the devices."
