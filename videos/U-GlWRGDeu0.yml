description: "Error - Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP)\nThis talk is primarily about psychology and relates to typical programming in no way. Neuro-Linguistic Programming is best described as new age pseudo science by some and the future of psychology to others.\n\nThrough this talk on NLP you will learn about the ability to control and otherwise manipulate as well as teaching via \"knowledge encoded linguistic algorithms.\" You should also gain the ability to do a \"cold read.\" You will also learn about \"NLP modeling.\" Some should walk away with a greater understanding of human psychological patterns.\n\nAbout me: Happily spreading memes for years to come."
