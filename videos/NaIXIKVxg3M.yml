title: 'Rocky Mountain Ruby 2015 - Rust for Rubyists by Steve Klabnik'
recordingDate: 1444063769
description: "Rubyists are famously polyglot. I've heard people joke that there are more JavaScript talks at some Ruby conferences than there are Ruby talks. But there's one area in which most Rubyists don't go: low-level programming. We often say 'Ruby is slow, but that doesn't matter. I'll just drop down to C when I need performance.' But C is pretty scary, so we never actually do it. In this talk, Steve will show off Rust, a new programming language from Mozilla. Steve will show you how that saying should change: 'drop down to Rust,' and why it's better for Rubyists than C.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HLd0/"
