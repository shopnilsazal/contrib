title: 'RailsConf 2015 - So Long, Hoboken: Migrating a Huge Production Codebase from Sinatra to Rails'
recordingDate: 1431446387
description: "By, Eric Weinstein\nSoftware is grown, not built, and that becomes clearest when we need to change it. This talk will discuss the motivations behind a framework migration, how to divide that migration into soluble subproblems, and how to conquer those subproblems in a test-driven way, all while ensuring the new codebase is designed with further growth in mind. We'll touch on mounting Rack applications inside Rails, SOA architecture, and how to map components of one framework to another."
