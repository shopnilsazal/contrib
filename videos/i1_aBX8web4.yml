title: 'EmberConf 2014 Modeling the App Store and iTunes with Ember Data by Jeremy Mack'
recordingDate: 1397836306
description: "Description I've spent the last six months mapping the entire data model of App Store and iTunes. The application I've created is like no other search engine in existence. It's 2014 and we're still searching for documents. Today, I'm debuting the next-generation of search, and it's built entirely with Ember and Ember Data. You're going to see how I did it, and why Ember Data was the prefect tool for the job.\n\nExpect code samples, anchored by examples of real use within a polished Ember application. I expect the audience to leave my talk energized, seeing the power of Ember Data, wanting to try it out for themselves on the web of APIs that are now within their reach.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG3L/"
