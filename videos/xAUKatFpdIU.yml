It now plays the samerole for JDK 9.\n\n              With a number of large changes being planned for JDK 9 that are    \n\nbeing developed through the OpenJDK community, reaching out to popular FOSSprojects well ahead of a release and keeping them informed of upcomingchanges, collecting as well as acting on their feedback created a greatfeedback loop.\n\n              Today, around 80 open source projects and communities participate    \n\nin testing of early access builds of the JDK, reporting issues they find, andhelping get them resolved in time.
