description: "The typical security professional is largely unfamiliar with the Windows named pipes interface, or considers it to be an internal-only communication interface. \nAs a result, open RPC (135) or SMB (445) ports are typically considered potentially entry points in \"infrastructure\" penetration tests.\n\nHowever, named pipes can in fact be used as an application-level entry vector for well known attacks such as buffer overflow, denial of service or even code injection attacks and XML bombs, depending on the nature of listening service to the specific pipe on the target machine.\n\nAs it turns out, it seems that many popular and widely used Microsoft Windows-based enterprise applications open a large number of named pipes on each endpoint or server on which they are deployed, significantly increase an environment's attack surface without the organization or end user being aware of the risk. \nSince there's a complete lack of awareness to the entry point, there's very limited options available to organizations to mitigate it, making it a perfect attack target for the sophisticated attacker.\n\nIn this presentation we will highlight how named pipes have become a neglected and forgotten external interface. We will show some tools that can help find vulnerable named pipes, discuss the mitigations, and demonstrate the exploitation process on a vulnerable interface."
