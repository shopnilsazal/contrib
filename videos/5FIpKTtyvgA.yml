description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\nThursday, September 18 â€¢ 2:00pm - 2:45pm\n\nRed Phish, Blue Phish: Improved Phishing Detection Using Perceptual Hashing\n\nWhile lacking the sex appeal of memory corruption based attacks, phishing remains a problem for many end users. Defenses against phishing have not advanced significantly. We will discuss current approaches to phishing detection, and present a new one along with accompanying tool.\n\nWe will discuss several perceptual hashing algorithms, and describe how we can leverage them to detect phishing sites masquerading as popular sites such as Paypal, Amazon, and others.\n\nCode to collect and identify these malicious sites, and a browser extension leveraging will be explained, demonstrated and released for attendee use and study.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\nDaniel Peck\nPrinciple Research Scientist, Barracuda Networks\nPeck is principle research scientist at Barracuda Networks, he is currently focused on studying uses of social networks as a medium for attacks. Previous research includes comparing content and non content based systems to identify malicious accounts on Twitter/Facebook, exploiting programmable logic controllers, and identifying/classifying malicious javascript. Peck has a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
