description: "Pry is a featureful irb replacement that provides Ruby programmers with a seriously souped-up REPL.\n\nUsing some real-life examples, I'll explain how to use Pry to program more effectively.\n\nWe'll start with the basics of exploring libaries and experimenting with code at lightning speed. Then we'll move up a level and discuss how to dig into, debug and even modify existing programs. Finally we'll cover a few of the plugins that make Pry a truly indispensible tool.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG5X/"
