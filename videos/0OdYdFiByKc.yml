description: "\"Implementing IPv6 on a Global Scale: Experiences at Akamai\", by Erik Nygren, Akamai\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this video are those of the speaker(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the USENIX Association.**\r\n\r\nAkamai's global platform for application acceleration and content delivery consists of nearly 100,000 servers in over 1,000 networks and 74 countries. We now have IPv6 connectivity in over 45 countries, with hundreds of server locations. Our diverse global footprint across many network providers has given us perspective into the Internet's IPv6 connectivity and has posed interesting challenges. This talk will touch on observations of IPv6 network connectivity and client behavior, common misconceptions, approaches for migrating sites to dual-stacked IPv6, and experiences with how dual-stack deployments impact server operations."
