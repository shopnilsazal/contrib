description: "By Joe Moore\n\nI've pair programmed almost every work day for 13 1/2 years. You've got questions. I've got answers.\n\nPresentations I give, regardless of topic, grind to a halt once I mention pairing. Do we pair all day? Who owns the code? How do I convince my boss to let us pair? When do you take bathroom breaks? What about remote pairing? Pairing is a scam!\n\nI'll answer all questions, from the poignant to the silly, and want you to share your own pair programming experiences. Ask me anything!\n\nJoe began writing software in the late '90s, soon joining eXtreme Programming pioneer Evant in 2000. He joined Pivotal Labs in 2005 as a founding member of their Rails consulting practice. Joe remote pairs full time for Pivotal and blogs at http://remotepairprogramming.com. His Ward Number is 1.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG03/"
