description: "Philippe Biondi - Security at Kernel Level\nSecurity is a problem of trust. Having a system that offers services to Internet and that can be trusted is very hard to achieve. Classical security models focus on the physical limit of the machine. We will see that it can be interesting to move the trust limit between user space and kernel space and that it is still possible to enforce a security policy from this trusted place. We will also see some practical aspects with a review of some implementations that exist for Linux kernels.\n\nPhilippe Biondi is a security consultant at Cartel Sécurité. He is involved in the developpement of LIDS. He does about everything that is related to computer security."
