description: "PyData NYC 2014\nUsing machine learning to beat your friends in a NFL confidence pool.\n\nBetting spreads provide a consistent and robust mechanism for encapsulating the variables and predicting outcomes of NFL games. In a weekly confidence pool, spreads also perform very well as opposed to intuition-based guessing and supposed knowledge from years of being a fan. We present some attempts and analysis to use machine learning in order to make improvements on the spread method of ranking winners on a weekly basis."
