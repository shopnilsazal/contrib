description: "Twenty Years Back, Twenty Years Ahead: The Arc of DEF CON Past and Future\nRichard Thieme, ThiemeWorks\n\nThieme's keynote at DEF CON 4 for a few hundred people was \"Hacking as Practice for Trans-planetary Life in the 21st Century.\" Mudge recently said, \"Some of us knew what you meant, and some of us thought you were nuts.\" That's likely to be the response to this talk too. Thieme addresses what he said 17 cons ago, why it was true, and illuminates some likely futures for hacking and hackers, anonymous 2.0.1, and the gray space of the noir world in which one is deemed a \"criminal,\" not because of what one does, but according to who one does it for.\n\nIdentity, in short, is destiny. More than ever, identity is a choice, modular and fluid.\n\nMudge was with the l0pht then, now he's with DARPA. Jeff Moss was an entrepreneurial hacker, now's he's with Homeland Defense. Too many to name work in agencies or stateless names and nameless states, fulfilling the vision of Thieme's first speech.\n\nBut that was then. What's likely to be next?\n\nThe more we idealize lone hacker wolves in fiction and films, the more assimilated we nevertheless become into many Borgs, not one. Technologies determine identity, flows of information shape our souls. The forms into which we fit - in thought, word, and deed - are who we think we are.\n\nSo most humans are flocks of birds in digital cages. Hackers however see the implications of making the cages, create the space in which others live. So the question still is, which pill do you want? But the matrix has morphed. It's malleable, plastic, and biological, infinitely fun to stretch into new shapes.\n\nThe next twenty years ... the vision of \"a deranged old man, wandering around the con,\" as someone said. But insanity, sainthood, wisdom look the same. The long view of distance, perspective across the years, is worth a million fast twitches. Combine rapid action and perspective, however ... turn context into content ... use both sides of your brain ... and you'll have mastery, a wild trip, and one hell of a good time.\n\nFull Bio is available here: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Thieme"
