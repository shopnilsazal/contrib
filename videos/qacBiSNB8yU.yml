recordingDate: 1516816492
description: 'The problem that new technology doesn’t fix is unmaintainable code. The core of maintainable code is clean code with good tests, but that by itself isn’t enough. This talk introduces techniques for optimising code for maintainability, including getting better at naming, explaining code with tests, which code comments you actually need, README-driven development and Minimum Viable Documentation. Traditional, software maintenance involves too much documentation and comments that no-one writes. Meanwhile, naming and abstraction are too hard to always get right, so you need small doses of comments and documentation. More importantly, you need to avoid wasting time on bad comments and documentation without giving up on them entirely. After the excitement of adopting new technology and software craftsmanship comes the horror of your next maintenance project. As Jean-Paul Sartre said*, ‘Hell is other people’s code’. As a lead developer, your future happiness depends on maintainable code.'
