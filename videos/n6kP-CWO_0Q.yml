language: English
recordingDate: 1505501558
description: "Kostya Serebryany, Google\n\nThe goal of OSS-Fuzz is to make common software infrastructure more secure by applying modern fuzzing techniques at large scale. Since the launch in Decâ€™16, our service has attracted over 50 popular OSS projects (from OpenSSL to LibreOffice) and automatically reported 1000+ bugs (including 200+ potential security vulnerabilities). In this talk, you will learn why we started this free service (hello, Heartbleed!), how it works, what kinds of bugs it detects, how to participate, and even how to get rewarded. The talk will include a ~20 minute live demo of libFuzzer - one of the fuzzing engines used by OSS-Fuzz.\n\nView the full program: https://www.usenix.org/sec17/program"
