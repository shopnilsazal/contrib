description: "Dan Kaminsky - Black Ops of TCP/IP 2011\nRemember when networks represented interesting targets, when TCP/IP was itself a vector for messiness, when packet crafting was a required skill? In this thoroughly retro talk, we're going to play with systems the old fashioned way, cobbling together various interesting behaviors with the last few shreds of what low level networking has to offer. Here's a few things to expect:\n\n* IPv4 and IPv6 Fragmentation Attacks, Eight Years In The Making\n* TCP Sequence Number Attacks In Modern Stacks\n* IP TTLs: Not Actually Expired\n* Inverse Bug Hunting: More Things Found On The Open Net\n* Rebinding Attacks Against Enterprise Infrastructure\n* BitCoin: Network Manipulation for Fun And (Literal) Profit\n* The Net Neutrality Transparency Engine\n\nDNS might show up, and applications are going to be poked at. But this will be an old style networking talk, through and through."
