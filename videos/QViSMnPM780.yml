description: "by: Ryan Stenhouse\n\nPCI DSS is a vague and horrific standard that anyone that has anything to do with taking or processing payments by card has to adere to. Luckily, it has as much to do with common sense as it does with security and is not as insurmountable a challenge as some would have you believe.\n\nI'll talk about what you need to know to become PCI DSS compliant, why you should care about it and how you can save tonnes of money using free software where possible based on my first hand experience at PCCL where myself and Nasser Khan designed and implemented our PCI Compliant infrastructure from scratch."
