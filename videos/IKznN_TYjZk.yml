description: "A Google TechTalk, July 22, 2016, presented by Bas van Dijk\nABSTRACT:   I will give an introduction to LumiGuide and talk about how we use Haskell to build our bicycle detection and guidance systems. The first part of the talk will be non-technical but in the second part I will dive deep into haskell-opencv: a Haskell to OpenCV 3.1 binding that we recently open sourced. Roel van Dijk and I will do a live coding session showing how to bind a function from OpenCV to Haskell. Along the way we demonstrate the use of the inline-c library, describe how we handle C++ exceptions and show how we are using advanced type system features to encode more information into the type of matrices.\n\nhttps://wiki.haskell.org/ZuriHac2016"
