Iâ€™ll discuss how to achieve collaboration in our objects vs. the more common command-and-control style. Iâ€™ll explore the importance of metaphor in designing our code. And Iâ€™ll describe how to achieve better design by anthropomorphizing your domain.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GHFq/"
