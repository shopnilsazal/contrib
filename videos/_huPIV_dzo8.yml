description: "by Kevin P. Fleming\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nIf you run an open source project, and you'd like to get contributions fromemployees at medium-to-large companies, the simplest way to provide a smoothcontribution process is to _not_ use a Contributor License Agreement. If yourproject requires one, though, there are steps you can take to ease the burdenthis causes on contributions from company employees, and this talk will covera number of issues encountered during 4+ years of managing contributions froma 20K+ employee global company.\n\nWhile there is a growing movement in the open source community away fromContributor License Agreements, many important projects still require them.Some of these projects are focused on 'enterprise' usage, so as a resultemployees of major companies want to contribute. However, the mechanisms usedto execute these CLAs vary widely (it seems that every project builds its ownCLA system), and none of them take into account the various legal andlogistical requirements of a major corporation who wants to contribute. Thistalk will present a series of problems encountered as a contributing company,and propose ways that CLA-requiring projects can resolve them.\n\nThese problems include (but are no means limited to): requiring the agreementto be executed on a social media platform; providing no ability for theauthorized signer and the manager of the authorized employee list to bedifferent people; requiring FAXed copies of agreements; failing to provide theability to authorize employees to contribute to specific codebases within alarge project; and more.\n\n\nRoom: H.1301 (Cornil)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 10:05:00"
