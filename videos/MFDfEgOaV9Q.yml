description: "Filmed at http://ng-poland.pl 2017 on NOVEMBER 21 in Warsaw. \n\nMiłosz Piechocki\n\nhttps://twitter.com/miloszpp\nhttps://github.com/miloszpp\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/miloszpiechocki\nhttps://codewithstyle.info/\n\nSoftware Architect\n\nI'm a passionate full-stack web developer and a software architect. I'm fascinated by functional programming. I’ve been using Angular and AngularJS for few years. I love sharing my knowledge as a public speaker at meet-ups and conferences. I run a programming blog and wrote an e-book about functional programming in JavaScript. I’m also an open-source contributor and a trainer. Privately, I love hiking in the mountains and having a good beer in a great company.\n\nHow to use Functional Programming with Angular and why it’s a good idea\n\nThe rise of popularity of Functional Programming in the JavaScript community is a fact. Projects such as Redux, Immutable.js, lodash or Cycle.js are becoming more and more widely used and we can see the trend by looking at language features introduced in the ES6 standard (constants, arrow functions, destructuring). On the other hand, Angular framework does not seem to be deeply invested in Functional Programming. However, there are still many ways of embracing the power of FP in an Angular application. During my presentation I will discuss these ways and most importantly I will explain why it’s a good idea to have a closer look at Functional Programming in general."
