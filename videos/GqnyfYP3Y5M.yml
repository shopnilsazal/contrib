title: 'GeeCON Prague 2017: Jakub Fojtl - Infinispan in the world dominated by raft'
recordingDate: 1516816639
description: 'Todayâ€™s world of distributed databases is dominated by raft or paxos based databases. The reason is simple - it offers similar properties as relational databases - such as ACID transactions, however, with huge operational overhead. But there is another computation model, which might be more suitable for distributed scenarios - especially, when you need to scale huge number of write operations. The world of consistent hashing functions and infinispan is an awesome example of that. I will share a story about how we achieve high availability in situations where the infrastructure is out of your control.'
