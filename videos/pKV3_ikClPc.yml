title: '#HITBGSEC 2017 CommSec D2 - Facebook: The Deep & Dark Web For Threat Actors In Asia - Fadli Sidek'
recordingDate: 1506064001
description: "In this presentation, i will share my findings on how the social networking platform Facebook is exploited by cyber criminals and cyber hacktivists to conduct, plan and organise their activities. I will touch on the following questions:\n\n1) Why is Facebook the platform of choice?\n2) How is it similar to the deep and dark web?\n3) What kind of cyber criminal businesses can be found on both the dark web and Facebook?\n4) How do hackers organise cyber operations ‘loudly’ but without attracting attention?\n\nAt the end of this talk, I will provide my views on why Facebook will continue to be the platform preferred  by threat actors rather than the dark web, and why it will be a challenge for both law enforcement and threat researchers alike.\n\n===\n\nFadli is currently a cyber threat intelligence analyst focusing on cyber activism and cybercrimes on Asia-Pacific with a deeper concentration on South-East Asia. He also has a huge interest in researching and understanding the TTPs of nation-states’ actors and their evolving modus operandis. He has spoken in several conferences worldwide such as in BSides and DefCamp and enjoys sharing his research to both the cyber security and threat intelligence communities."
