title: 'Jeremy Nixon, Convolutional Neural Networks at scale in Spark MLlib'
recordingDate: 1505934432
description: "Jeremy is a Machine Learning Engineer at the Spark Technology Center, focused on scalable deep learning. His last major contribution was a deep neural network for regression in Spark, which he had the opportunity to speak about at Apache Big Data. He has contributed to MLlib at the STC, which he joined after graduating from Harvard College concentrating in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.\n\n\nConvolutional Neural Networks at scale in Spark MLlib:\nJeremy Nixon will focus on the engineering and applications of a new algorithm built on top of MLlib. The presentation will focus on the methods the algorithm uses to automatically generate features to capture nonlinear structure in data, as well as the process by which itâ€™s trained. Major aspects of that include compositional transformations over the data, convolution, and distributed backpropagation via SGD with adaptive gradients and an adaptive learning rate. Applications will look into how to use convolutional neural networks to model data in computer vision, natural language and signal processing. Details around optimal preprocessing, the type of structure that can be learned, and managing its ability to generalize will inform developers looking to apply nonlinear modeling tools to problems that they face."
