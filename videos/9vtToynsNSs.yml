description: "Martin Packman | Thursday 10:30 | Room C\n\nWe are now in a git monoculture in version control system land. Where does that leave us if we want:\n\n    A command line interface that doesn't suck\n    A format not built on (weakened) SHA-1\n    A way to customise behaviour using Python\n\nThis talk introduces Breezy, a fork of the Bazaar VCS, suitable for hacking on by anyone, with git format support using Dulwich.\n\nFind out how (and why) to contribute, with the confidence of a comprehensive test suite to validate your changes."
