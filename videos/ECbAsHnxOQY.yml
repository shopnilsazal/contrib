description: "Introducing Bluetooth beacons\n\nFundamentals \n- how beacons leverage Bluetooth low energy capabilities\n- see Bluetooth advertising in action\nBeacon types – iBeacon, AltBeacon and Eddystone\nBeacon advertising data formats explained\nEddystone frame types\nAndroid and the fundmental classes involved in detecting and responding to beacons\nCode samples\nBeacons and application issues and challenges\nLive demonstrations including a real dinosaur using BBC micro:bits acting as beacons\nDistance estimation\nBeacons and wearables\nThe Physical Web\nMake your own beacon\nFuture beacon technology\n\nIt’s just possible there will be prizes too!\nThe Physical Web is Google’s flagship Internet of Things (“IoT”) project , whose aim is to make it possible for people to simply “walk up and use anything”.\n\nBluetooth Eddystone beacons are central to the Physical Web and ABI Research forecast that by 2020, over 500 million Bluetooth beacons will be shipping *per year*.\n\nBluetooth 5 was just released and includes advances which pave the way for the next generation of beacon technology.\n\nAndroid developers have an enormous opportunity to create IoT solutions which leverage this trend towards Bluetooth connectionless, proximity-based scenarios. From parking metres, to art galleries and museums. From retail outlets, to airports and emergency services, Bluetooth beacons and the physical web will be everywhere in the not too distant future.\n\nAttend this session to learn how beacons work, what makes Eddystone special, what a Physical Web architecture might look like and to gain some insight into “real world” issues that developers can face. There will be demos and you’ll learn some tricks of the trade such as how to make your own beacons.\n\nBluetooth beacons are an essential ingredient in the IoT and every developer who is interested in carving a path in the world of IoT for themselves should know about them.\n\nCome to this session and you’ll be set on the right path for IoT success."
