description: "How is it that over 20 years of cinema has taught us nothing about securing our systems and protecting end users? It’s time to take a look at how life has imitated art as we journey through famous “Movie” hacking. It is time to challenge how the Information Security Industry is currently struggling in 2016 with protecting networks from the hypothetical hacks of 1980’s and 1990’s! This keynote will be ending in a Hollywood-styled demo of an attack on CCTV systems where we will identify why we need to work harder and faster to fight for the users!
