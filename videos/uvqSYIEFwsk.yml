title: 'Keeping the flow going: Data-flow oriented workflow systems - Annette Bieniusa (Lambda Days 2017)'

description: "http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/annette-bieniusa\n\nWork flow frameworks have become an integral part of modern information systems. They provide a clearly defined interface and structure for interaction with a system. The specification of work flow systems, however, is usually ad-hoc. Often, programmers simply define a number of tasks (forms and actions) that are sequentially connected. Users are then restricted to input data in this prescribed order.\nIn this talk, we present a data-flow oriented work flow system where the data flow is described in terms of a purely functional program. This approach offers the user and the system flexibility in the order of tasks while guaranteeing a consistent and correct result."
