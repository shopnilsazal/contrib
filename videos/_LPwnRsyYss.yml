Developers got prod access. Code deploys to prod happen multiple times a day now. In the eyes of the business, things are great. Yet, the security team continues to be left out and really nothing seems to be better. In fact it feels worse.\n\nTime to learn how to hack some devops for great good.\n\nThis talk will equip you with advice and tools to join in on the devops. You will also leave with a sample continuous delivery pipeline that is armed to dangerous and ready to identify security issues in a typical web application stack.\n\nWeâ€™ll use a range of open source technology including OWASP ZAP, gauntlt, brakeman, nmap, sqlmap, arachni and more.\n\nBio\n\nJames is an innovative thought leader in the DevOps and InfoSec communities and has a passion for helping big companies work like startups to deliver products in the cloud. He got his start in technology when he ran a Web startup company as a student at University of Oklahoma and since then has worked in environments \n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
