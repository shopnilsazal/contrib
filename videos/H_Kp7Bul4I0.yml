Whether it be home networks, open hotspots at cafés, corporate networks or corporate guest networks they can be found virtually everywhere. Fortunately, for the security minded, some steps are taken to secure these weak points in one’s infrastructure. Usually this is done through some form of registration page which is common in the case of guest networks. But is this enough? And what new threats could be unleashed from even the most isolated of Wi-Fi networks?\n\nIn the most paranoid of cases, companies will generally attempt to isolate Wi-Fi networks from their official networks in order to protect their own assets from attacks, while still ensuring that Wi-Fi is convenient for end users. But there is another way to attack a company that could be damaging to the host company and harmful to other targets. This presentation will go over the utilization of various techniques of getting onto and getting out through publicly accessible Wi-Fi networks for nefarious purposes, termed Wi-Fi Exfiltration. Through this technique one is able to obfuscate their identity by using the host of the Wi-Fi’s identity, thus implicating the host in the attack.\n\nDuring the presentation we will cover the findings through our tests along with a list of recommendations for what can be done to mitigate this risk. This is a must attend session to all security professionals and high level management.\n\nSpeaker Bios:\nPeter Desfigies is a Security Consultant at TELUS Communications Inc. where he works with a team of other operations analysts to proactively investigate and analyze customer traffic, while also providing threat intelligence on attacks, campaigns, and zero-days in order to protect customer’s environment and enhance their security posture.
