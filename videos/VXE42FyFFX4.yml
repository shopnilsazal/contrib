description: "RubyConf 2016 - The Neuroscience and Psychology of Open Source Communities by Elizabeth Barron\n\n***Contains explicit language***\n\nBecause people are complex, diverse creatures, ensuring that your open source community is healthy, vibrant, and welcoming can be challenging. The good news is, science can help you understand human thoughts and behaviors, and the complexities of interacting in a collaborative way online. We'll discuss cognitive biases, the SCARF collaboration model, the online community life cycle, and how these things interact. You'll come away from this talk with a deeper understanding of yourself, your fellow humans, & the knowledge to improve personal interactions and the open source communities you belong to."
