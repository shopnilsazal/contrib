It will show how to get started using it and some of the most important features.\n\nOne of these features is the ability to write tests in a more “pythonic” way by using the assert statement for assertions. Another feature in pytest is fixtures – a way to handle test dependencies in a structured way. This talk will introduce the concept of fixtures and show how they can be used.\n\nNo previous knowledge of pytest is required – this talk is for people who are new to testing or has experience with other Python testing tools such as unittest or Nose."
