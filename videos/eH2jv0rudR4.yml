His paranoia is getting the best of him as he looks behind him. No one is following him, but he senses they are coming. He is afraid. The hack hadn't gone down as planned. Damn it, he was supposed to have taken everything into account, he got sloppy. He knew his only saving grace was no one would be able to recover his laptop. Not after what he did to it.\nJack pulls out his cell phone to make what will soon be his last phone call.\n\nHe looks around anxiously to make sure that he is alone before making the most important call of his life. He notices a man digging through a trash can. He decides not to risk the man overhearing him and chooses to send a text message instead. With his palms starting to sweat he texts:\n\"net hax. Hidn. Dngr. Plan?\"\n\nJust as the send button is pushed the alley is swarming with agents. Jack is thrown up against a wall. Agents begin to frisk him and take the remains of his hack from him. His cell phone, PDA, and iPod are all that is left of his digital task.\nHe watches and wonders will they find anything to tie him to what has just happened as he is taken away into custody.\nBack at the crime lab, the agency's uber geek lab babes Amber and Tyler are under the gun to get this case solved.

They start their examination on the three items from the scene the cell phone, PDA and an iPod.\n\nCan these two super sleuths use digital forensics on the few devices recovered to figure out what Jack Grove was up to, who his accomplices were, and find the evidence needed to prosecute?\nBy using this scenario, Amber and Tyler will bring the audience into the crime lab with them. Taking the devices from seizure to analysis showing where Jack Grove has left his digital fingerprints. Once the fingerprints are gathered the audience will work with these two examiners to piece together the case and solve the crime and prove Jack's innocence or guilt.\nThe audience will gain an overall understanding of digital forensic handling and procedure.
