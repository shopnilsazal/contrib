title: 'Check your app''s vitals by Wojtek Kaliciński, Google EN'
recordingDate: 1529097076
description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Wojtek Kaliciński, Google.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-3\n\nThere are four primary vital signs: body temperature, blood pressure, pulse (heart rate), and breathing rate (respiratory rate).\n\nCan we identify basic signals that would show us the health of an Android app? How about checking for common problems, such as battery drain, jank, crash rate and excessive network usage?\n\nOf course, no amount of local testing under laboratory conditions can identify these problems reliably, not with a limited number of devices and users. That's why it's better to check vitals on a living organism, or in this case, an app that is released to users. Open Android Vitals on the Google Play Console to find out about real issues that real users are encountering in the wild.\n\nRequiring no special instrumentation from your side, you will get detailed alerts about stuck wakelocks, wrong wakeup and network usage patterns and many more known bad behaviors.\n\nBut diagnosing the problems is just half of the solution. During this session I will show tools and techniques on how to deal with the issues using tools that we have at our disposal, such as Android Profilers, Systrace, Strict mode, Battery Historian and more.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
