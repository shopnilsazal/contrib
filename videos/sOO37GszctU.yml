description: "FOE -- Feeding Controversial News to Censored Countries (Without Using Proxy Servers)\nSho Ho Software Engineer, Broadcasting Board of Governors\n\nCertain countries are banning their Internet users from accessing websites that are deemed inappropriate by their officials. News organizations' websites are commonly blocked by these countries, and there are little these organizations can do to reach their audience inside those countries. FOE is a new anti-censorship tool developed in-house by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (which oversees Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, Radio Farda, Radio Free Asia, etc.), which main goal is to create a multi-platform (including mobile) architecture that allow Internet users in censored countries to receive unbiased news.\n\nSho Ho had been a freelance software developer for about 10 years and recently joined the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the Federal Government agency that oversees and supports broadcasters such as Voice of America, Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe, etc. Sho is a member of the Internet anti-censorship team at BBG whose duties include developing and managing anti-censorship technologies to help Internet users in censored countries to bypass Government censorships.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
