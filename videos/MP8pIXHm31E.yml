description: "Jimmy Bogard\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/dotnetfringe/sdktqq/\nLet&#39;s not kid ourselves - OSS is fun to create but that&#39;s really just the beginning. In order to have a truly successful OSS project, it requires discipline, sometimes years so. I&#39;ve been lucky enough to have a few successful projects, and a few not-so-successful ones. While my journey has been long, I&#39;ve finally reached a point of serenity, losing the stress and worry by tweaking how I viewed OSS and how I defined success. It&#39;s this journey I&#39;ll share so you can too succeed at OSS."
