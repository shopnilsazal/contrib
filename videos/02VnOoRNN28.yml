description: "DEF CON 16 - Jason Scott: Making a Text Adventure Documentary\nFor the past 3 years, Jason Scott (creator of BBS: The Documentary) has been working on another project, telling the history and the legends of text adventure games. 80 interviews later, he comes to DEFCON to show footage, describe the process of making the film, why history of games is important, and what it was like to visit the actual cave the first adventure game was based on.\n\nJason Scott is celebrating 10 years of running his computer history archive TEXTFILES.COM. He is a documentary filmmaker, computer historian, retro-nostalgia cynic, and blabbermouth. He lives in Massachusetts with a very, very large pile of stuff. His weblog tends to be at https://ascii.textfiles.com. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
