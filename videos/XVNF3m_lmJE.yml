description: "Felipe Espinoza and Javier Bustos, NIC Labs\n \nNIC Chile is the DNS administrator of the ccTLD .cl, managing over 500.000 domain names in an infrastructure composed by more than 30 servers distributed around the globe (some of them belonging to one of the three Anycast clouds used in the name service) answering a ratio of around 3,000 queries/sec per server. In this scenario, we took the challenge of build a real-time monitor system four our DNS service, by only using open-source software.\n\nWe reviewed and benchmarked different alternatives: Packetbeat, Collectd, DSC, Fievel, and GoPassiveDNS for data collection; Prometheus, Druid, ClickHouse, InfluxDB, ElasticSearch, and OpenTSDB as DB engines; and Kibana, Grafana, and Graphite Web for visualization. The info we wanted to know were, Five top-queried domains, mean length of DNS queries, and the number of queries per subnetwork, per operation code (OPCODE), per class (QCLASS), per type (QTYPE), per answer type, per transport protocol (UDP, TCP), and with active EDNS.\n\nWith that scenario, we measured:\n\nCPU used by DB.\nRAM\nSecondary memory\nTime required for data aggregation\nWe present two compatibility matrices summarizing our findings and a ready-to-use open-source integrated monitoring system.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
