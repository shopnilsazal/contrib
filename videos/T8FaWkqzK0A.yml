description: 'Using EEG and Azure Machine Learning to Perform Lie Detection: Today, we have the technology to “read minds” (well, EEG waves!). Using an EPOC headset from Emotiv, I have captured 14 channels of EEG (brain waves) while subjects lied and answered truthfully to a series of questions. I fed this labelled dataset into Azure Machine Learning to build a classifier which predicts whether a subject is telling the truth or lying. In this session, I will share my results on this “lie detector” experiment. I will show my machine learning models, data cleaning process, and results, along with discussing the limitations of my approach and next steps/resources. This session will be a fun look inside your brain waves along with demonstrations of data processing and predictive analytics. Attendees will gain exposure to the Emotiv EPOC+ headset and Azure Machine Learning.'
