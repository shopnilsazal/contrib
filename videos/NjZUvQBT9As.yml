recordingDate: 1392968820
description: "Jay Beale - Bastille Linux 2.0: Six Operating Systems and Still Going!\nBastille Linux is a security tightening program that has proven capable of thwarting or containing many of the vulnerabilities discovered in operating systems. Originally written for Red Hat Linux, Bastille has now been ported to six operating systems, including HP-UX. This talk will talk about what Bastille does, what we've done to it in the last year, and what we're working on next. Most importantly, it will teach you something about hardening systems and beating worms, even if you're an old spacedog of a sysadmin.\n\nJay Beale is the president and founder of JJB Security Consulting and Training, LLC. He is the Lead Developer of the Bastille Linux Project, which creates a hardening program for Linux and HP-UX. Jay is the author of a number of articles on computer security, along with the upcoming book \"Locking Down Linux the Bastille Way\" to be published in the second quarter of this year by Addison Wesley. You can learn more about his articles, talks, courses and consulting via http://www.bastille-linux.org/jay."
