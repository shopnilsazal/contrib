description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nSIG Service-Catalog Deep Dive – Doug Davis, Michael Kibbe, Google, & Morgan Bauer, IBM (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nIn the \"SIG Service-Catalog Intro\" session we provided an overview of the Open Service Broker API and the Kubernetes implementation being developed by the Service Catalog SIG. With that background, this session will go into some of the challenges we faced in making it a reality. Whether it was because we were trying to use bleeding edge features of K8s, or trying to align very radically different processing models between K8s and other OSB API Platforms, our SIG has had an interesting time trying to navigate these waters. Come learn about these these challenges and how we've chosen to solve them.\n\nAbout Michael\nMichael Kibbe is a software engineer on the Cloud Services team at Google. Michael works on the Kubernetes Service Catalog project and the Open Service Broker API. His goal is to get us to a world where it is easy to consume hosted services, such as those offered by Google Cloud, anywhere, be it on a third-party cloud provider or on-prem!\n\nAbout Morgan\nMorgan Bauer works on Open Source at IBM in San Jose as part of the Cloud Division. Morgan is a maintainer on the core Docker Engine and also a founding contributor of the Kubernetes Service-Catalog.\n\nAbout Doug\nDoug works in IBM's Digial Business Group. He's been working on Cloud related technologies for many years and has worked on many of the most popular OSS projects, including OpenStack, CloudFoundry, Docker and Kubernetes. He's currently co-leading the CNCF's Serverless WG, the Cloud Events specification work and the Open Service Broker API WG."
