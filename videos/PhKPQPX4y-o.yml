description: "It’s pretty widely accepted that performance impacts business success. So where do you start and how do you make sure you’re successful? It’s not just about making the slowest pages faster or having the fastest root cause analysis in a fire drill. We need to start to manage performance like a product and use data to gain clear prioritization of efforts and improve performance where it matters most.\n\nThere will always be emergencies, but we can use product management strategies and data to help us work smarter; allowing us to identify and focus on the most impactful places to optimize. Maximize efforts and impact by making sure you and your team are focused on what matters most to your company, customers and bottom line. We’ll step through some of the keys of product management and how to apply them to performance and optimization projects."
