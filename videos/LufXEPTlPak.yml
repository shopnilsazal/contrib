description: "You know the ins and outs of pivoting through your target's domains. You've had the KRBTGT hash for months and laid everything bare. Or have you? \n\nMore targets today have some or all of their infrastructure in the cloud. Do you know how to follow once the path leads there? Red teams and penetration testers need to think beyond the traditional network boundaries and follow the data and services they are after. This talk will focus on how to take domain access and leverage internal access as a ticket to your target's cloud deployments. \n\nWe will also discuss round trip flights from cloud to on-premises targets and what authorizations are required to access your target's cloud deployments. While this talk is largely focused on Microsoft Azure implementations, the concepts can be applied to most cloud providers."
