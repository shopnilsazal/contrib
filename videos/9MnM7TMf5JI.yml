description: "18k visible components + canvas = 60 FPS or How we created browser inside browser\nArt Yavorsky, Software Attorney @ Hell Yeah and Babel Contributor\n\nImagine. You have an app. Initial loading takes about 12 seconds. To understand what the shit is it you are trying to scroll your page. Only 500 px down and you’ve wasted 3 seconds of your life. Ok, you successfully opened console to figure out what is going on. Yeah, it has jquery in deps, so you are trying to just count how many elements is present on the page. `$(“.App *”).length` returned 18000. With a twitching eye after a shock, you can take different decisions. You can try drugs, change profession, or even worse - rewrite your app from scratch using canvas. I chose the last. So, I’m going to share some experience about best ways to use canvas with your react app and make it declaratively and scalable.\n\nJoin us on meetup.com: https://www.meetup.com/Kyiv-ReactJS-M...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/reactkyiv\nTelegram chat: https://telegram.me/reactkyiv"
