recordingDate: 1389129373
description: "With Rails 4 supporting only Ruby 1.9 and above it can fully embrace the MiniTest library that ships with Ruby 1.9. What does this mean for Rails developers? Let's find out.\n\nIn this talk we'll look at using MiniTest in a simple, non-Rails, project and then work up to using it in a Rails application. We'll look at both the TestUnit and RSpec style syntaxes that MiniTest offers. We'll also learn to write custom matchers, run specific files, and much more.\n\nTesting is important to all Ruby and Rails developers, and with such a powerful testing library already bundled with Ruby, shouldn't we learn how to use it?\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4L/"
