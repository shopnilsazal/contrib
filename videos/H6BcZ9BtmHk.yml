description: "RenderMan & Panel: The Church of WiFi's Wireless Extravaganza\nThe Church of WiFi (reformed) returns to Las Vegas bigger and better than ever. Last year we brought you the first pre-computed rainbow tables for faster WPA cracking. This year, we've gone overboard and expanded the tables to places and sizes not dared before. Can you say: our own live distro?\n\nAnd that's not all: we're prostelytizing our wireless foo this year by hosting the Wireless Village, a place for tutorials, mini-presentations, and breakout sessions. Of course, we have some new projects to show you and a few more ideas on the horizon. Isn't it time you converted?\n\"RenderMan\nRenderMan has been a fixture in the wardriving community for many years. He never seems to be out of crazy projects and ideas, never very far from wardriving news, often causing it himself. He also co-authored \"RFID Security\" for Syngress publishing. He spends his time working on things like the 'stumbler ethic', Worldwide wardrive, 'the warpack' and the Church of WiFi. When not working to make wardriving an acceptable hobby, he can usually be found taking something apart, creating an army of cybernetic fluffins, trying to win the Defcon wardriving contest, or more likely, at the hotel bar.\n\nMichael Schearer (\"theprez98\") is an active-duty EA-6B ECMO. He flew combat missions during Enduring Freedom, Southern Watch, and Iraqi Freedom. He took his EW specialty to Iraq, where he embedded with Army units. While at Penn State, he is actively involved in IT issues. He is a licensed amateur radio operator, an active member of the Church of WiFi and a regular on the DEFCON and NetStumbler forums. He lives in Pennsylvania with his wife and 3 kids.\n\nFrank (\"Thorn\") Thornton\nThorn runs his own technology-consulting firm, Blackthorn Systems. An interest in Amateur Radio has also helped him bridge the gap between computers and wireless networks. Thorn's experience with computers goes back to the 1970's when he started programming mainframes. Over the last thirty years, he has used dozens of different Operating Systems and programming languages. According to others who should probably know better, Thorn is \"widely recognized as one of the premier experts in wireless networking and wireless security.\" \n\nIn addition to his computer and wireless interests, Thorn was a Law Enforcement Officer for many years. As a detective and forensics expert he has investigated approximately one hundred homicides and thousands of other crime scenes. Combining both professional interests, he was a member of the workgroup that established ANSI Standard ANSI/NIST-CSL 1-1993 \"Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint Information.\" Thorn is a co-author of \"WarDriving: Drive, Detect, Defend\", \"Game Console Hacking\", \"RFID Security\", \"WarDriving & Wireless Penetration Testing\" and contributor to \"IT Ethics\"and \"Emerging Threat Analysis\" -all by Syngress Publishing. He resides in Vermont with his wife."
