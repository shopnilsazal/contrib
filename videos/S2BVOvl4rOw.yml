recordingDate: 1423775701
description: "By: Ben Mabey\n\nUser Stories have become common practice among Agile teams. Cucumber is a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) tool, written in Ruby, that allows teams to capture these stories in plain English as a series of scenarios. These scenarios become executable acceptance criteria that are incorporated into the development cycle allowing the developer to always know â€œwhatâ€™s nextâ€ and when the software is â€œdoneâ€. This talk is for every Agile team member but will provide enough technical details to enable a tester or developer to start using Cucumber immediately."
