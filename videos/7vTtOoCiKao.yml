description: "Engineering Engineering: More than the sum of our parts by Vietor Davis\n\nApplying the tried and true answers of “It depends.”, “Maybe?”, and “It works for me, what if you try …” to our engineering organizations themselves turns out to work better than trying to find the One True Way. We all know that every engineering project is full of trade-offs, caveats, surprising complexities, and hidden depths; so it should be no surprise that we, the engineers who build such systems, are at least as complicated.\n\nThis is a sponsored talk by Procore."
