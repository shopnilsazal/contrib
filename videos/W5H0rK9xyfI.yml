description: "Off the Beaten Path: An Explorer’s Guide to Kubernetes - Taylor Thomas, Intel\n\nIn the past year, Kubernetes proved itself as a powerful tool for creating and managing service based architectures. However, as with anything new, it is easy to find yourself lost when the complexity of a service increases and you enter into uncharted territory. Using our team’s work with Jenkins, Snap, and Cassandra in Kubernetes as a backdrop, this presentation will deep dive into specific pain points and how we solved them. Coupled with code examples and demonstrations, this presentation will show a pattern of how to solve undocumented issues and invite others to the discussion of documenting solutions to similar problems.\n\nAbout Taylor Thomas\nTaylor Thomas is a Cloud Software Engineer for the Software Defined Infrastructure team at Intel working on Kubernetes, CI/CD, and the Snap open telemetry framework. Taylor has a background in IT Operations and API development and is one of the co-organizers for the Docker Meetup in Portland. He is a Gopher by way of Node.js and enjoys working in DevOps. You can find him on Twitter (@_oftaylor) or on GitHub (thomastaylor312)."
