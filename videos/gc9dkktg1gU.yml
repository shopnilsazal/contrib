description: "Marko Samastur - Publish your code so others can use it in 5 easy steps\n[EuroPython 2016]\n[20 July 2016]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/publish-your-code-so-others-can-use-it-in-5-easy-steps)\n\nAs developers we all love well-documented, well-tested packages. If we\ndo the same for our code it is easier for others to re-use our hard\nwork, and maybe even contribute. We will take a quick look on how to\ndo this using popular tools and only a small investment of time. With\nGithub and some simple tools, setting up a well-groomed package\ndoesn't have to be difficult.\n\n-----\n\nEvery Python open-source developer wants their software to be used. As\ndevelopers, we trust software that is tested and well-documented.\n\nIn this talk we'll go through 5 steps for how to do this for your own packages.\n\nWe will take a quick look on how to do this using popular tools and\nsmall investment of time:\n\n- Write a setup.py script for a pure Python package\n- Set up py.test, tox and coverage to test our package with multiple\nversions of Python\n- Configure Github to use Travis CI & coveralls.io to automatically\ntest our package every time we commit\n- Register and publish our package to PyPI\n- Setup our documentation on ReadTheDocs"
