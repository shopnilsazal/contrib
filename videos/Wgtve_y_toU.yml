recordingDate: 1461255058
description: "Whether it be for an action shooter or for a more laid-back RPG experience, creating a new NPC for a game can be an interesting challenge, especially under tight time constraints. Often, it involves many different departments all coordinating in a way to get a distinct character rather than a muddle of different pieces and parts. This 2014 lecture from Daniel Brewer and Rez Graham will walk through two distinct examples: Warframe's Grineer Hellion and the Royal Advisor from The Sims: Medieval, and explain some of the process of how these characters were designed and built.\"\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
