description: "Mike Müller - Functional Python with Mochi\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\n[Slides][1]\n\nWhile Python supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional\nprogramming, its functional features are not fully developed. Mochi is\na Python-like functional language that compiles to Python 3 and PyPy 3\nbytecode. It can use Python libraries and can be used from Python.\n\nMochi adds functional features such as tail recursion optimization, no\nre-assignments in function definitions, persistent data structures,\npattern matching, algebraic data types, a pipeline operator, better\nanonymous functions, Erlang-style actors, Lisp-style macros as well as\nmany useful builtin functions.\n\nThis talk presents what Mochi is, how it works, and what you can do\nwith it. Functional programming can help to solve certain kind of\nproblems elegantly. Done right, functional programs can be easily\ntested and provide more confidence that you program is really doing\nwhat you want. Mochi could be another tool in your toolbox. Functional\nprogramming can expand your horizon and can be a lot of fun. Mochi\noffers easy access to this new world because you can leverage your\nexisting Python knowledge and libraries whenever needed.\n\n[Slides][1]\n\n[1]: http://www.python-academy.com/talks/europython2015/Functional%20Python%20with%20Mochi.slides.html#/"
