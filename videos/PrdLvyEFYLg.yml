description: "Valerio Maggio - Machine Learning Under Test\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nOne point usually underestimated or omitted when dealing with \nmachine learning algorithms is how to write *good quality* code.\nThe obvious way to face this issue is to apply automated testing,\nwhich aims at implementing (likely) less-buggy and higher quality\ncode.\n\nHowever, testing machine learning code introduces additional concerns\nthat has to be considered. On the one hand, some constraints are\nimposed by the domain, and the risks intrinsically related to machine\nlearning methods, such as handling unstable data, or avoid\nunder/overfitting. On the other hand,  testing scientific code\nrequires additional testing tools (e.g., `numpy.testing`),\nspecifically suited to handle numerical data.\n\nIn this talk, some of the most famous machine learning techniques will\nbe discudded and analysed from the `testing` point of view,\nemphasizing that testing would also allow for a better understanding\nof how the whole learning model works under the hood.\n\nThe talk is intended for an *intermediate* audience.\nThe content of the talk is intended to be mostly practical, and code\noriented. Thus a good proficiency with the Python language is **required**.\nConversely, **no prior knowledge** about testing nor Machine Learning \nalgorithms is necessary to attend this talk.\n\n**Slides**: [https://speakerdeck.com/valeriomaggio/machine-learning-\nunder-test-at-europython2015]()"
