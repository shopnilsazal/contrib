description: "PyData London 2018\n\nStochastic Solutions is producing a course on Anomaly Detection in Python for DataCamp. This workshop will give a preview of part of that course. Topics covered will include characterizing normality and abnormality, spotting anomalies by eye, building automated anomaly detectors over various kinds of data streams and types, and considerations for monitoring (false positives vs. false negatives).\n\nSlides: https://github.com/tdda/pydatalondon2018ad/blob/master/AnomalyDetectionPyDataLondon.pdf\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
