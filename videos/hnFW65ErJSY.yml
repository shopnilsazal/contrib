Why bother with the hassle of storing passwords, keeping them safe, and being on the hook if they get out? And see if we can justify making users remember another long, secure array of characters (because we all know users create strong passwords by nature). \n\nBut OAuth is HORRIFYING. You aren't sure *why*, you just HEARD it was awful so you just jotted that down. \n\nLuckily, .NET Core has some great tools for simplifying these specifications down to a few calls, allowing your users to log in with services like Google, GitHub, and many, many more.\n\nWe'll look over how to use one of the premade providers, and how to implement a custom OAuth2 provider, in a .NET Core app."
