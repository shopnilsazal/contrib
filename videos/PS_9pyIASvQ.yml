description: "Serious Programming with jq?! A Practical and Purely Functional Programming Language! by Charles Chamberlain\n\nEver heard of jq? If so, chances are youâ€™ve used it to format and syntax-highlight your JSON. You might have even used something like jq '.foos[]' to print each foo! But did you know jq has user-defined functions? That jq has modules? Get ready to take a dive into the wondrous and purely functional land of the jq programming language!\n\nCharles is a 20-year-old undergrad. He spent the last year at Uber, and is now working on a math major at UChicago. He likes writing compilers while drinking probably too much tea."
