description: "Learn to Make Music. With Ruby. by Darin Wilson\n\nIf you can write code, you can make music. And in this talk, and you'll see exactly how.\n\nWe'll take a look at Sonic Pi, a powerful, multi-platform app that uses a Ruby DSL to create just about any kind of music you can think of.\n\nAnd if you've never made a note of music in your life, fear not: you'll also get a crash course in music composition and learn how the elements of rhythm, melody, and harmony work together to make a cohesive whole.\n\nBring your laptop and headphones: this will be very hands-on, and you'll be making your first track before we even get to questions!"
