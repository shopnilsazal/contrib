title: 'Kod.io 2014 - Continuous Translation: I18n in Agile Projects by Burak Yiğit Kaya'
recordingDate: 1396536979
description: "Translations or rather internationalization in projects are usually a \"post-release\" step and managing them was always quite a burden:\nstring freeze → extract those strings → send strings out (or put them in a DB) → wait for translations to come in → get the translations in the app → release.\n\nIf you notice errors in your translations, rinse & repeat, GLHF.\n\nIn this talk you'll see a new approach that will make you stop worrying about translations and have them as a part of your CI stack.\n\nBurak will be sharing the journey and machinery behind getting the distributed social network Disqus available in more than 28 languages and counting, without hampering their development speed and daily deploys.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG3S/"
