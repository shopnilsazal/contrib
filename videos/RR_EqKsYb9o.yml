title: '#HITB2018AMS D2T2 - Defense-in-Depth Techniques for Modern Web Apps - M. Spagnuolo & L. Weichselbaum'
recordingDate: 1524985343
description: "In this presentation, we show promising new defense-in-depth techniques to protect modern web applications from old and new classes of bugs: Suborigins to have finer-grained control over origin boundaries, Site Isolation and XSDB against Spectre and Meltdown attacks, and last but not least Origin and Feature Policy.\n\nIn addition to that, we explain new features of the upcoming CSP 3 specification like ‘unsafe-hashed-attributes’ and give an overview of how we were able to enforce CSP as a strong mitigation against cross-site scripting on over 50% of production web traffic at Google.\n\n=== \n\nMichele Spagnuolo is a Senior Information Security Engineer at Google focusing on security enhancements and mitigations for web applications. He co-authored the specification for ‘strict-dynamic’ in the W3C Content Security Policy specification, serving as a strong mitigation against cross-site scripting attacks. Other works include Rosetta Flash and BitIodine.\n\n--- \n\nLukas Weichselbaum is a Senior Information Security Engineer at Google focusing on security enhancements and mitigations for web applications. He co-authored the specification for ‘strict-dynamic’ in the W3C Content Security Policy specification and wrote the CSP Evaluator (csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com), a tool for developers and security experts to check if a Content Security Policy serves as a strong mitigation against cross-site scripting attacks. Lukas previously worked on dynamic analysis of Android malware. He also founded Andrubis – one of the very first large scale malware analysis platforms for Android applications."
