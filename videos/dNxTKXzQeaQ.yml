title: 'Test-drive the development of your command-line applications by David Copeland'
recordingDate: 1326934480
description: "Rubyists love testing, and test-driven-development is becoming the way to write code. But, do we do this with our command-line tools? How do you write a test that your awesome application cleans up its temp files? How does one make a failing test for a missing command-line option? What's the easiest way to check our app's exit codes?\n\nThis talk will answer these questions with some real-world examples. We'll talk briefly about the challenges particular to testing command-line apps, and then dive into some code where we'll show off techniques for organizing code for testability, tools for interacting with the filesystem, and how to create full-blown acceptance tests for your command-line app. In no time, you'll be able to write your command-line apps the same way you write your other code: test-first.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGk5/"
