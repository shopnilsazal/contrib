Iterative code samples will illustrate how our understanding and use of Elixir and Phoenix over the last two years have led to greater developer productivity and happiness and more reliable, responsive and efficient systems. With billions of monthly visitors and push notifications sent, Bleacher Report is in a unique position to show metrics that validate the aforementioned claims. Metrics will convincingly show that technical problems with fluctuating traffic problems have been eliminated through the adoption of Elixir and Phoenix.
