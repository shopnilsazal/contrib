description: "PyData SV 2014 \nAt Facebook, data is used to gain insights for existing products and drive development of new products. In order to do this, engineers and analysts need to seamlessly process data across a variety of backend data stores. Dataswarm is a framework for writing data processing pipelines in Python. Using an extensible library of operations (e.g. executing queries, moving data, running scripts), developers programmatically define dependency graphs of tasks to be executed. Dataswarm takes care of the rest: distributed execution, scheduling, and dependency management. Talk will cover high level design, example pipeline code, and plans for the future."
