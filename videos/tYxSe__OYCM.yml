description: "by Deb Nicholson and Molly de Blanc\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nWe want the free software movement to keep growing and one facet of successfulmovement building is embracing a multi-generational community. The good newsis that there is no age requirement for using, promoting and contributing tofree software. The bad news is that we aren't always doing a great job offacilitating a diverse, inter-generational movement. We'll take a look at whatwe're currently doing to bring in young people, how we are treating olderpeople in our communities and where there is room for improvement.\n\nUsing examples from other movements and inter-generational communities, we'llidentify tactics that aren't being used to build the free software communityand see what we can collectively port over. We plan to inspire the audience tofind ways to recruit and retain young people, inspire older people toparticipate and maintain an unbroken thread of free software conservatorship.\n\n\nRoom: Janson\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 16:00:00"
