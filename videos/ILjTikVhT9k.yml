description: "PyData Chicago 2016\n\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/secret/DwbGswbtHTmYvy\nGithub: github.com/kevinvangundy\n\nIn this session we will show how to build a meetup.com recommendation engine using Neo4j and Python. Our solution will be a hybrid approach which makes uses of both content based and collaborative filtering using Neo4j to glue all the data together, Cypher to query the dataset and Python to do analysis and pre/post processing of data."
