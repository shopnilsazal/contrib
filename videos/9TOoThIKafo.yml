description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nDeploying SQL Stream Processing in Kubernetes with Ease - Andrew Stevenson & Antonios Chalkiopoulos, Landoop (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nReal-time processing allows you to act faster and SQL allows you to construct flows quicker and reuse existing skills. Apache Kafka is a key component but how do you peek into the data, the topologies and create repeatable deployments that can be promoted to production? Andrew and Antonios will show you how to easily create end to end data pipelines on Apache Kafka and deploy them to Kubernetes with no code required, only configuration.\n\n\"About Andrew\nAndrew is CTO of Landoop, creators of Lenses for Apache Kafka, a unified Streaming platform for Apache Kafka. He created the largest collection of Kafka Connectors in the open source Stream Reactor project. He's spent many years in the trenches implementing big and fast data solutions and now focuses on simplifying development and deployment of streaming solutions into Kubernetes.\n\n\nAbout Antonios\nAntonios, CEO of Landoop, is a published author in Big Data and functional data pipelines, and an open source contributor. In his past he has delivered numerous successful Big Data projects in the Finance, Media, FinTech industries in London, and is currently pioneering with Lenses for Apache Kafka https://lenses.stream - and committed to providing the industry the tooling they deserve for building native Kafka / and Kubernetes data-streaming pipelines and operating them with confidence.\""
