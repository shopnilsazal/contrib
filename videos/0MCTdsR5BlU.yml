title: 'e4e Developer Conf 2015 - Sometimes a Controller is Just a Controller by Justin Searls'
recordingDate: 1444319977
description: "Sometimes a Controller is Just a Controller\n\nWe don't know what good code looks like, and we probably never will.\nAnd yet, we spend a lot of time arguing about code quality. This is a talk about the flaws in our collective assumptions about \"good code\", and how that flawed reasoning has snowballed to deleterious effect in individuals, on teams, in our community, and throughout the industry.\nExploring this theme, we'll find reinforcing loops that push out empathetic developers in favor of more callous ones. We'll see why teams actively resist diversity. We'll better understand our demand for thought-leading celebrities. We'll even learn how our \"Good Code\" delusion has educated businesspeople to misunderstand the nature of software.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HM5w/"
