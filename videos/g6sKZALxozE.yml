title: 'Rocky Mountain Ruby 2012 - Building in Rails, Backbone, and CoffeeScript by Derrick Ko'
recordingDate: 1351051904
description: "Realtime, rich client applications are extremely popular. This is reflected in a new generation of frameworks like node.js and meteor. That said, the maturity of Rails and Backbone combined with real time services like XMPP or Pushr, still makes it a very compelling backend stack to use, especially when developing cross platform (web, desktop, mobile) applications.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss the foundation and best practices of a Rails/Backbone/Coffeescript real time stack, as we do it at Kicksend."
