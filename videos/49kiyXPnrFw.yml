description: "Description from DEF CON 9 Speakerâ€™s Page: \n\nSo you got your lame ass sued: A legal narrative.\n\n\"The Defendant\" put up a website critical of his ex-employer, and within a week found himself in the center of a $120,000 lawsuit, facing some of the most powerful lawyers and largest firms in the country. With a week to fight the restraining order put against him, he had to learn everything he needed to know about legal procedures, presenting a defense, and speaking to the press. Through this, he kept the website up, answered many questions, and became the lightning rod for hundreds of angry, mistreated employees. Come listen to what he learned, and get some ideas in case it's ever you in the courtroom."
