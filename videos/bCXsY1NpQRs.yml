title: 'GeeCON 2017: Adam Dubiel - HTTP clients: silent heroes of distributed systems'
recordingDate: 1502695040
description: 'Communication is the cornerstone of distributed systems. Our services often communicate using HTTP protocol and it is difficult to imagine a modern project without a HTTP client. However we often forget how important role they play. Have you ever wondered what hides behind different clients APIs? How does the magic work? What properties and options should be set in HTTP client and why do they matter? During this talk i will show what happens behind the scenes when using popular high-level HTTP APIs: RestTemplate, Jersey and Retrofit. What settings are crucial to make the most out of them, how to detect failures quickly, what are the bottlenecks and how to monitor them. I will also talk about lower level clients hiding behind those APIs: Apache Client and OkHttp. Come and listen if you want to be a conscious user of these fundamental tools. Level: beginner and everyday user'
