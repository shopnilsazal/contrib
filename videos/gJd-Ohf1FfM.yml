description: "PyData London 2018\n\nOceanography and climate science is experiencing a rapid growth in both observational data and numerical model output. The tools and workflows professional researchers and students currently use are not keeping pace with this growth. Recent additions to the Python data stack, such as xarray and dask, provide a way to enable scientists to work with the ever-increasing size of datasets.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/jmunroe/big-data-oceanography-at-pydatalondon-2018\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
