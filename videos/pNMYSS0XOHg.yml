description: "Ignite: How to Run a Killer Summer Internship Program for Engineers at a Baltimore Startup by Steve Feldman\n\nWho says successful summer internship programs in engineering are only for Silicon Valley, Seattle and the large enterprise software companies? Not this guy. Startups are a great place to run and organize an internship. Baltimore has the best of what's to offer any college student looking for the total internship experience.\n\nAt Contrast Security, we've run a successful summer internship program in engineering for University students for the last 3 years. Our software engineering interns go through an elaborate, yet fun 3-month program with an emphasis of preparing them for a career in agile software development and a front-row seat at VC-backed startup.\n\nWe would like to share with the Baltimore DevOps community our journey building a successful program. We will talk about many of these topics:\n\nHow to recruit at local and national colleges/universities?\nInvolving your staff in the recruiting and interviewing process.\nEstablishing a structure for the program with the right kinds of goals and objectives.\nGiving your interns something for their GitHub portfolio\nThe start-up experience\nStickers, shirts and other swag"
