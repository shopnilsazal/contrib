recordingDate: 1391561580
description: "Alexander Muentz: Protecting your IT infrastructure from legal attacks- Subpoenas, Warrants and Transitive Trust. \"\nYou think your systems and data are safe from any attack. You fear no script kiddie. You get a +5 against social engineering. Yet a single subpoena can crack your junk open wide. A search warrant might leave you with an empty server room. \nThe law might be the biggest threat to your users, systems and you. Learn how to plan for and react to search warrants, subpoenas and wiretaps. I?m going to speak about the law in an IT context, make it accessible and relevant. If you manage other people's systems for a living or just are afraid of your own privacy and liberty, you might want to see this. \nAlex Muentz is a lawyer and a sysadmin. He's interested in the intersection between law and technology, and has given talks (PumpCon, H.O.P.E. Six, L.I.S.A.) and published papers (2600, SysAdmin, ;login:) on this topic. He does some pro bono representation for technology professionals. He hopes he isn't as boring as this sounds."
