description: "Effective system-level performance analysis in complex computing environments  presents a hard problem.  This is a problem shared by all platforms and solutions begin with pervasive instrumentation and measurement.\n\nThis talk will describe the Performance Co-Pilot project and  covers how python tools can be used to customise it for your own environment.\n\nA practical introduction will be given showing how to write python tools to export real-time performance metrics from arbitrary system components so that the data is available for live and retrospective analysis.  A customised distributed analysis tool will then be built using that data.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nAugust 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
