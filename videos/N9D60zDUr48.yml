recordingDate: 1511107375
description: "Xavier Amatriain is currently co-founder and CTO of Curai, a stealth startup trying to radically improve healthcare for patients by using AI. Previous to this, he was VP of Engineering at Quora, and Research/engineering Director at Netflix, where he led the team building the famous Netflix recommendation algorithms. Before going into leadership positions in industry, Xavier was a research scientist at Telefonica Research and a research director at UCSB. With over 50 publications (and 3k+ citations) in different fields, Xavier is best known for his work on machine learning in general and recommender systems in particular. He has lectured at different universities both in the US and Spain and is frequently invited as a speaker at conferences and companies.\n\nAbstract Summary:\n\nML to Cure the World:\nThe practice of medicine involves diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. Recent technological breakthroughs have made little dent to the centuries-old system of practicing medicine: complex diagnostic decisions are still mostly dependent on “educated” work-ups of the doctors, and rely on somewhat outdated tools and incomplete data. All of this often leads to imperfect, biased, and, at times, incorrect diagnosis and treatment.\n\nWith a growing research community as well as tech companies working on AI advances to medicine, the hope for healthcare renaissance is definitely not lost. The emphasis of this talk will be on ML-driven medicine. We will discuss recent AI advancements for aiding medical decision including language understanding, medical knowledge base construction and diagnosis systems. We will discuss the importance of personalized medicine that takes into account not only the user, but also the context, and other metadata. We will also highlight challenges in designing ML-based medical systems that are accurate, but at the same time engaging and trustworthy for the user.\n\nSee Xavier's slides here: https://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/xavier-amatriain-cofounder-cto-curai-at-mlconf-sf-2017"
