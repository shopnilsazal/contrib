recordingDate: 1383378939
description: "Michael Scarito - Build your own Synthetic Aperture Radar\nRadar is used extensively by the military, police, weather, air travel, and maritime industries - why not you? Come learn how to build a radar imaging system on the cheap! This talk will explain the basics of how radar works as well as how to measure range and velocity of your chosen targets. You will learn how to use synthetic aperture techniques to generate a two- or even three-dimensional image. The hardware and software design will be totally opened up so you can go home and build your own system.\n\nThe talk will try to run through the basics pretty fast, so some knowledge of electronics or basic physics might help, but is not required! Regardless of your background, you will see the capabilities of a modern home-built radar system and hopefully get some ideas for your own uses.\n\nMichael Scarito is a multidisciplinary hacker masquerading as an electrical engineer. Interests include physical and cyber security, surveillance systems, innovative uses for radio frequency electronics, and projects which incorporate all of the above."
