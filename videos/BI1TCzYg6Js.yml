description: "Computer Literacy for Every Kid in the World by Natasha Dobson\n\nNo longer is there an access divide, but a knowledge divide. Kids know how to consume technology, but they need to know how to create with it. To create with it they need to be computer literate. Computer literacy is more than just coding, it includes 6 skill groups that I've identified as the keys to empowering kids to be able to do computational thinking. This talk is for parents, educators, and kids to easily understand how prepare students for daily life, school, and their future career.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Gim7/"
