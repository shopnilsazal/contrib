description: 'Lockpicking is a very popular hobby among hackers and tech experts. From the days of Ted the Tool at MIT to modern LockSport championships that draw experts and hobbyists from around the world... opening a lock without a key is no different than solving any other manual and mechanical puzzle. If you liked Rubik''s Cubes and Brain Teaser puzzles when growing up, perhaps lockpicking is for you! This is the standard TOOOL "Intro to Lockpicking" talk which has been presented at many conferences and universities around the world!'
