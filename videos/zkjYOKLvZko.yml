title: 'Python as a philosophy (Rudolf Olah)'
recordingDate: 1523292308
description: "A number of programming languages that have not been used quite as frequently as others contain “profound enlightenment” that a developer learns through their use. Languages such as Lisp and Smalltalk are in this category. This presentation suggests that Python is also one of those languages. Python and PEP20 The Zen Of Python can affect how a developer writes code and then translates their practice into using other programming languages. For example, my own hands-on programming in Python has allowed me to carry on a number of practices into JavaScript and Ruby. The talk will specifically cover “explicit rather than implicit” code and the value of documentation as a developer-user experience. I will outline several examples and counter-examples of Python-inspired code practices within the context of JavaScript and Ruby.\n\nPresentation page -- https://2017.pycon.ca/schedule/28/"
