title: 'RailsConf 2015 - Beyond Hogwarts: A Half-Blood''s Perspective on Inclusive Magical Education'
recordingDate: 1431030348
description: "By, Jaime Lyn Schatz \nWhen Voldemort and his forces threatened us all, two of the three wizards (and witch) who led his defeat were not raised in the magical world. Schools like Hogwarts can help us identify and train those with innate magical talents and interests whom we might otherwise never discover. But how to find and teach those beyond the reach of our owls? This talk explores our options and will serve as a call to action for the Magical world. As we will see, these challenges are almost magically mirrored by the Rails community as we seek to find and train developers from non-traditional paths."
