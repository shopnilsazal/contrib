description: 'Recommendations for Building Machine Learning Software: Building a real system that uses machine learning can be a difficult both in terms of the algorithmic and engineering challenges involved. In this talk, I will focus on the engineering side and discuss some of the practical lessons we’ve learned from years of developing the machine learning systems that power Netflix. I will go over what it takes to get machine learning working in a real-life feedback loop with our users and how that imposes different requirements and a different focus than doing machine learning only within a lab environment. This involves lessons around challenges such as where to place algorithmic components, how to handle distribution and parallelism, what kinds of modularity are useful, how to support both production experimentation, and how to test machine learning systems.'
