title: 'LoneStarRuby Conf 2013 - Refactoring Legacy Apps with APIs and Messages'
recordingDate: 1376951422
description: "By Corey Ehmke\n\nRails as a framework is famous for getting an application up and running quickly, but the very paradigms that make it so easy at the start can lead to maintenance nightmares down the road. Successful applications grow rapidly larger, more complex, and harder to extend and maintain. One way to approach refactoring a monolithic application is dividing it up into a series of smaller applications that organize the work of the system through internal APIs and message queues. In this presentation you will be introduced to tools to enable this architecture, gain insight on how best to use them, and explore the guiding principles behind the SOA approach to refactoring.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG83/"
