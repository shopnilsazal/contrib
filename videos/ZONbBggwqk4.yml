description: "PyData London 2018\n\nHow to, and what for use a new software package? The discovery of API, programming abstractions and package capabilities at the same time is a complex process for the user. In this talk I will review several tools which make this process easier for the user: simple APIs, galleries of examples, umbrella functions for exploring algorithms, etc. Using such tools, some packages such as scikit-learn or scikit-image can be used to solve efficiently data science questions, but also to improve one's culture and intuition in data science.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
