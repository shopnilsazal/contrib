description: "\"Empathy Marketing: Why Vulnerability is the Greatest Tool in Your Arsenal\"\n\nAs a marketer, I spend a lot of time talking about brands. Brand voice. Brand vision. Brand imaging. You can’t throw an iPhone two feet at a blogger conference without hearing about someone’s brand. But what nobody talks about when it comes to brand building is what happens at the moment of connection. That moment when someone chooses to share or subscribe or plus one or give your content a thumbs up. What’s happening in that moment is empathy marketing at it’s most pure. It’s the start of a true relationship between the content creator and their audience, and it’s the most valuable relationship a company - a brand - can build. Let’s explore this openhearted marketing together though storytelling, personal experiences and - at the core of it all - vulnerability."
