description: "Andreas Klostermann - Brainwaves for Hackers 3.0\n[EuroPython 2016]\n[20 July 2016]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/brainwaves-for-hackers-3)\n\nThis talk is about using our **Python** skills to explore the\n**secrets of our brains**.   Using the Neurosky Mindwave as a\nbluetooth connected EEG device, I'll talk about new experiments I have\nperformed inside the Jupyter notebook, for example \"Evoked Response\nPotentials\" and more about \"Neuro Feedback\" training.\n\n-----\n\nElectroencephalography **(EEG)** measures potential waves originating\nwithin the brain. Billions of brain cells fire  inside your brain,\neach sending out a minuscule wave. The summed potential waves can be\nmeasured, even with quite cheap and **portable devices**.\n\nBeing the third major version of this talk, I'll talk briefly about\nthe Neurosky Mindwave and the Muse headset. I have also developed more\ninteractive Jupyter experiments, which I'll demonstrate in the talk.\nFor example **Evoked Response Potentials (ERP)** can be demonstrated\nwith relatively simple means. Also I'll talk some more about\nexperiments with **Neuro Feedback**."
