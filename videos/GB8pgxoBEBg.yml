title: 'MountainWest JavaScript 2014 - Using TDD to Tame the Big Ball o'' Mud by Brandon Hays'
recordingDate: 1397764735
description: "By Brandon Hays\n\nYou have it in your codebase. You've tried to clean it up. Heck, you may have written it. It's the Ball of Mud.\nIt didn't start out that way. You just wanted to add some nice interactive functionality to your website. But then one jQuery plugin turns to three, you add a dash of statefulness, some AJAX error handling, and here you are, unable to sleep at night.\nBut your client-side ball of mud can be tamed! We'll walk through test-driving a refactor until the code is understandable, usable, and extensible.\nWe'll use Ember Components, though the pattern holds for the framework (or no framework) of your choice. It's time to get excited, not exasperated, when asked to add advanced client-side interactions to your website.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG3F/"
