title: 'DEF CON 18 - Sumit Siddharth - Hacking Oracle From Web Apps'
recordingDate: 1383697454
description: "Sumit Siddharth - Hacking Oracle From Web Apps\nThis talk will focus on exploiting SQL injections in web applications with oracle back-end and will discuss all old/new techniques. The talk will target Oracle 9i,10g and 11g (R1 and R2) It is widely considered that the impact of SQL Injection in web apps with Oracle back-end is limited to extraction of data with the privileges of user mentioned in connection string. Oracle database does not offer hacker friendly functionalities such as openrowset or xp_cmdshell for privilege escalation and O.S code execution. Further, as Oracle by design do not support execution of multiple query in single SQL statement, the exploitation is further restricted. The Talk will highlight attack vector to achieve privilege escalation (from Scott to SYS) and O.S code execution, all by exploiting Oracle SQL injections from web applications. Further, as a number of organizations move to compliances like PCI ensuring that the Card data is always stored encrypted with the private key never stored inside the database. The talk will focus on what hackers are doing in the wild to bypass these and to obtain clear text card data when its only stored encrypted or even when its never stored.\n\nSumit \"sid\" Siddharth works as a Principal Security Consultant and heads the Penetration Testing department for 7Safe Limited in the UK.\n\nHe has been a speaker at many security conferences including Defcon, Troopers, OWASP Appsec, Sec-T, IT-Underground etc. He has contributed a number of whitepapers, security tools, exploits and advisories to the industry. He also runs the popular IT security blog www.notsosecure.com.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
