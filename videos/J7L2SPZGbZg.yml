description: "This 2016 VRDC talk from Playful's Dan Hurd and Evan Reiland is a technical postmortem on the processes and surprising revelations of working on Lucky's Tale, the first third-person, character-action platforming game designed exclusively for Virtual Reality. Third-person is not what many initially imagine for VR, but Lucky's Tale demonstrates surprising comfort, ease of navigation, and a high degree of presence and immersion.\_\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
