description: "Phil Haack\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/dotnetfringe/sdkxmr/\nThe foundational book Peopleware presents the thesis that the biggest challenge in building software systems is sociological, not technological. It turns out this applies not just to systems, but software communities and companies.\nIn this talk I&#39;ll cover some of these challenges and some practical tips on how we can be a force for improvement. This ranges from specific tips for being a better maintainer/citizen on GitHub to general communication patterns that help foster a great open source community."
