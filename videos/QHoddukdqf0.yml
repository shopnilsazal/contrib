description: "RailsConf 2018: The GraphQL Way: A new path for JSON APIs by Nick Quaranto\n\nHave you written JSON APIs in Rails a few times? Even if you’re escaped implementing a “render: :json” call, some day soon you’ll need to get JSON data out to a native client or your front-end framework. Your Rails apps might change, but the pitfalls for JSON APIs stay the same: They’re hard to discover, difficult to change from the client side, and documenting them is a pain. For your next app, or your current one, let’s consider GraphQL. I'll show you how to implement it in your app and offer real-world advice from making it work in an existing Rails app."
