description: "by Molly de Blanc\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThis talk examines the way the free software community communicates with oneanother, and ways codes of conduct and community guidelines affect language.By analyzing mailing lists, looking at the frequency with which participantsuse slurs and expletives before and after the institution of codes of conduct,we can see how effective these policies are, and what sort of spaces they arecreating for community members and project contributors.\n\nThis talk is the follow up to talks at Libre Planet (2016) and SeaGL (2016),taking a mostly (and then progressively less) humorous look on language usedon Twitter and mailing lists, and the positive and negative ways we use stronglanguage to talk about free software, and talk to each other about freesoftware. This talk will include a general look at the purpose of codes ofconduct and community guidelines, what sort of things make one policy \"good\"or \"bad,\" and, when possible, the process by a given community agrees on theinstitution of one. It will then focus on statistical analysis of language useon a chosen number of mailing lists (including the Linux Kernel Mailing List),with outstanding examples.\n\nThis talk will likely include some strong language.\n\n\nRoom: H.1301 (Cornil)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 10:20:00"
