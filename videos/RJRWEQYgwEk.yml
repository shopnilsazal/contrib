description: "How graphs became just another big data primitive\n\nGraph-shaped data is used in product recommendation systems, social network analysis, network threat detection, image de-noising, and many other important applications. And, a growing number of these applications will benefit from parallel distributed processing for graph featuring engineering, model training, and model serving. But today’s graph tools are riddled with limitations and shortcomings, such as a lack of language bindings, streaming support, and seamless integration with other popular data services. In this talk, we’ll argue that the key to doing more with graphs is doing less with specialized systems and more with systems already good at handling data of other shapes. We’ll examine some practical data science workflows to further motivate this argument and we’ll talk about some of the things that Intel is doing with the open source community and industry to make graphs just another big data primitive."
