description: "Pluck It by Adam Cuppy\n\nHow many times have you written the same bits of code, over and over, and thought, “You know, if only this was big enough to be a gem, I would pluck it out.\" Often, we think of a RubyGem as a larger library of code that we “bolt on” to an app. And, these smaller code blobs become a hassle to distribute to the multiple apps that use them.\n\nA small micro-library, done the right way, at the right time, can greatly improve an app.\n\nBut, when can you benefit from extracting a micro-library? And, how do you build and publish that code into a RubyGem? I'll go through the process, from A to Z."
