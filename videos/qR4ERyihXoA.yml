description: "This is the 3rd part in our Service Fabric Team Tour series. \n\nAs before, this is a truly random excursion around the hallways and pods of our team in Redmond. Thanks to all the folks who kindly played along with us. Special call out to Deep for taking time out of his insane schedule to lead the tour and share his insights and good nature with us. You'll see him again soon :)\n\nTune in and stay tuned for some deep dives into the fabric of Service Fabric. Also, the final part in this series is upcoming.\n\nLOOK HERE:  Interested in a limited edition Service Fabric t-shirt and maybe a laptop sticker, too? Tweet something nice to @deepkkapur and tag with #SFTeePlease\n\nLinks:\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/D-1mfk3Vv-4\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/dfZ7ZAy11Fk\nPart 4: https://youtu.be/F1aq5bRJvDU\n\nService Fabric Source Code :-) :  https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric\nService Fabric Docs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/"
