Lol.\n\nWix - http://bit.ly/1yGOAkq\n\nLos and I talk about Wix and take a tour of their tool, talking about how to use it, and who would benefit from something like this.\n\nWe like Berries.\n\nThanks again to wix.com for sponsoring this episode and keeping DevTips ad-free! ~ http://bit.ly/1yGOAkq\n\nVisit Los @ losmontoya.com\n\n---\n\nDevTips is a YouTube show about web design and development.\n\n\"HTML5 Basics\" Playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KlJn1pMYPVV3eYzxJlWcON\n\n\"CSS Basics\" Playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4IOmy04kDxh_hqODMqoeeCy\n\n\"How to build a professional website from start to finish\" Playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KQZUkRjfwMmTq_f1fbxerI\n\n----\n\nFollow the DevTips GitHub Page to get all the codez:\nhttps://github.com/DevTips\n\nDevTips now has a twitter account:\nhttps://twitter.com/DevTipsShow\n\nTravis also tweets:\nhttps://twitter.com/travisneilson\n\n\n\nVideo transcript\n\n------\nHello everybody and welcome to exciting episode of DevTips, this is a unique episode for a lot of reasons. the first one being that I am not in my garage tonight, which is nice. The second one is that I'm joined by Los Montoya, Iâ€™m not alone. You may remember him from classic episodes like [CSS Basics - Cascades and Responsive Website Basics. So welcome, Los.\n\nThank you, thank you.\n\nIt's also a unique episode because we are not learning how  to code websites, in fact we are learning how to not code websites. We are using a service called Wix.com to help you make simple and fun websites.\n\nThank you to wix for sponsoring this episode.\n\nSo here is the set up. Your mom calls.\n\ncalls you?\n\nYes, your mom calls me.\n\nYour mom calls. An she is really excited about this idea she has, she wants to be a famous food critic. Her idea is, she needs, of course, a blog. That's why she called you.\n\nYou could do what we did and a few episodes ago in DevTips and start, you know, making a Jekyll Generated blog. The problem is: I'm not so sure your mom is so excited about running commands in the terminal.\n\nHere you go, terminal. Have at it. Enjoy.\n\n\nAnother option, you could jump her over to wordpress land, but even then she is still going to run into templates and an admin backend that she needs to fuss with before she can get what she wants out of the site.\n\nYea, that's pretty annoying.\n\nYou know, I find when you increase complexity towards reaching a goal, people are less likely to follow through over time. \n\nIt's times like this, you know, mom isn't trying to learn template hierarchy, when something a little more straight forward, a little bit more simple is the best choice.\n\nSo what er are going to do is: we are going to take that example of your mom needing a cooking blog and we are gonna see if we can meet those needs using the website: wix.com\n\nThat's cool. She called you though?\n\nWe chat for a long time. She is really chatty.\n\nAnyway you're probably watching DevTips because you have a friend or family member that called you up as well and said you to internets. Can you make something for me? And that is why you're watching devtips, you want to build something.\n\nBut there are ways out there to make things better simple and fun.\n\nSo I want to see if we can get this all done in under 15 minutes. Build your mom a block in under 15 minutes. let's get started.\n\nCool so I just locked into wix .com and the only thing I can do is just start creating, which is awesome.\n\nSo I will start creating right now, and the first step in creation is to pick up a template.  \n\nAnd the first step in creation is to pick a template. and they have tons of really awesome templates that chest, you know I'm sure we could find one for your mother.\n\nShe's a foodie so let's just do a search I guess, let's just search food. And that one looks nice, salt and pepper. Salt and pepper. \n\nWait, scroll down. How many? 10 pages? 10 pages of food sites.\n\nSo I'm going to go over, actually I'm going to go down to the topics, and go to personal blogs.\n\nHere's that salt-and-pepper one. Oh, okay, this one.\n\nI'm going to take one that's actually not a food blog because I want to show you guys how easy it is to take things and twist things around to make them work for you. \n\nSo this is not a food blog, but we're going to turn into a food blog.\n\nWe are in the preview mode, you can jump in and out of templates like this, but now I am going to chose to edit this site. And we are going to load the editor."
