title: 'GoGaRuCo 2010 - Bryan''s ActieModel Extravaganza by: Bryan Liles'
recordingDate: 1428437715
description: "Imagine you are at a conference. Imagine while you are at the conference, there are 30-minute sessions of various Ruby related topics. Imagine Bryan Liles is at this same conference. Imagine Bryan Liles. Imagine ActiveModel. Imagine Bryan Liles talking about ActiveModel. Can you imagine anything better? Maybe vanilla ice cream on apple pie. As a close second place, Bryan will show you why you need to at least investigate ActiveModel for your current or next project. Of course there will be tests, code, and more tests at Bryan's ActiveModel Extravaganza.\n\nIn this session, I will discuss why ActiveModel could be a great interface to allow Rails to get access to your data on your own terms. I'll start from the beginning, and using TDD, I'll explore the interfaces Rails 3 exposes in their API. Next, I'll explore the components of ActiveModel. Finally, I'll show you how I'm using ActiveModel right now, and give you a real-world war report. I repeat: There will be code.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GZSk/"
