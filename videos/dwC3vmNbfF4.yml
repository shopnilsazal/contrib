description: "Why I'm Bringing Robots to Prison by Lindsey Wilson\n\nAs Star Wars recently reminded us, robots are very popular. What Star Wars didn't explain, along with why Death Stars are so easy to blow up, is how robots can reduce recidivism.\n\nThis talk explores the landscape and demographics of our prison system, the role that tech plays today, and how the tech community, a group that prides itself on solutions-oriented innovation, can turn our strengths toward solving problems here in our community.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VDjs/"
