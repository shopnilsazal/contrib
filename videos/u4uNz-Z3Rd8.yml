description: "By Jeremy Kahn\n\nJavaScript allows us to define complex behavior as well as respond to events. Modern browsers give us JavaScript APIs that are optimized for animation timing, but we still only get 16 milliseconds to render. Alternatively, CSS handles the heavy lifting of timing and rendering for us. However, it is often not as flexible as JavaScript and therefore has different use cases. How do we know what language is best for the job?\nIn addition to APIs, high-quality animation requires effective workflows and tooling. With animation being such a visual craft, text-based workflows will only get us so far. In this session, we will explore some of the visual tools to help us build better animations more easily than ever before.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG21/"
