description: "PyData New York City 2017\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/data-science-keys-to-open-up-opennasa-datasets\n\nOpen source data has enabled society to engage in community-based research, and has provided government agencies with more visibility and trust from individuals. I will briefly introduce the openNASA platform with over 32,000 open NASA datasets, and I will present open NASA metadata analysis, and tools for applying NLP/topic modeling techniques to understand open government dataset associations."
