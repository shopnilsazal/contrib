description: "By, Adrian Pike\nRemember when Heroku showed up and how much it changed our world? Suddenly a simple `git push` and my app was online. Gosh, those were the good days, weren't they? Things have gotten a little more complicated for us these days. We've got inter-service dependencies. We should be doing some rolling deploys and user segmentation. Rollbacks should be instant and trivial. What about staging environments, why not be able to roll code safely? As an engineer, I should just be able to `git push`, and get back a running app instance. I should be able to route traffic to it whenever and however I want, whether it's production, staging, internal test, or just a running code spike on production servers to show a colleague. In this talk, I'm going to talk about the tools and infrastructure that I've built in the past to solve deployment woes for big, thorny, complicated apps, and give engineering teams tons of power. I'll also show off an open-source implementation that I'll be building specifically for RoA.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GUQS/"
