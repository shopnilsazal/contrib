description: "SimpleDelegator, Forwardable, and more By Jim Gay\n\nWith Ruby you have simple tools at your fingertips that make building powerful tools easy.

Learn the basis of the ideas behind these and combine the features to build your own powerful patterns. See how these compare to libraries like ActiveSupport::Delegation and look at how popular presenter libraries like Draper and DisplayCase work.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4p/"
