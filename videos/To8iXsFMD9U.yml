title: 'Enhancing your Control over Kubernetes with Spinnaker and Continuous Delivery'
recordingDate: 1525823776
description: "Developers have to deal with a huge number of tools that all have to work together in order for you to deliver software. By orchestrating resources such as containers and services, Kubernetes goes a long way towards decreasing the pain of creating applications, but some of the items that are out of scope, such as notifications and approvals, making sure the right artifacts are going to the right place, and orchestrating deployment strategies above the Kubernetes object level are non-trivial issues that can make or break your ability to provide Continuous Delivery. Fortunately, Spinnaker, the open source Continuous Delivery tool, ties together many of the tools we use every day, such as Kubernetes and Jenkins, to provide enormous power over your software pipeline to solve these problems. In this webinar, you will learn:\n\n- How Spinnaker concepts such as clusters and server groups relate to their Kubernetes counterparts\n- How Spinnaker deployment on Kubernetes works, including integration with additional tools such as Jenkins, Helm, Terraform or Prometheus, to simplify and standardize operations\n- How to deploy Kubernetes resources with Spinnaker\n- How to create a Spinnaker pipeline that integrates automated and manual approvals to ensure the quality of deployments\n- How to use Spinnaker to automatically deploy to multiple Kubernetes (and non-Kubernetes) clusters simultaneously to easily create multi-cloud solutions"
