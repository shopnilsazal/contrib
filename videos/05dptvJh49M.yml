language: French
recordingDate: 1479736863
description: "Speaker: Sun Seng David TAN (Serli)\n\nAt Eclipse, new actors are challenging the classic Eclipse IDE:\n\n- Che: the next gen Eclipse Cloud, brings the developer workspace and the IDE on your browser\n- Orion: an extensible browser IDE\n- Flux: a new message based architecture for cloud based developer tooling\n\nThese technologies open a lot of new kind of features such as real time live collaboration.\nDuring this session, I will live demo of a prototype showing real time collaboration from 3 different IDEs. The prototype will use a Flux server running inside a Che docker workspace that will allow Orion, Eclipse IDE and Che editors to edit the same file in real time like in Google Docs. Come with your laptop, your phone or tablet and join our pair programming session!"
