description: "RailsConf 2018: Here's to history: programming through archaeology by Eleanor Kiefel Haggerty\n\nDoes your git log output resemble an archaeological site from 500BC? Ransacked by Persians with some Spartan conflict? When we code and commit, our decisions, for better or worse, are preserved. As though in an archaeological record. Thanks to the archaeological record we can understand entire human cultures, but how much do we understand about the decisions developers are making today? Applying the same practices archaeologists utilise can help us understand the decisions developers are making in 2018."
