recordingDate: 1354526575
description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/materials/\n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT: \n\nHuawei routers are no longer devices only seen in China. Entire countries run their Internet infrastructure exclusively on these products and established tier 1 ISPs make increasing use of them. However, very little is known of Huawei's Software Platform and its security. This presentation will introduce the architecture, special properties of configurations and services as well as how to reverse engineer the OS. Obviously, this is done only to ensure compatibility with router products of other vendors Routers might be still hurt in the process.\n\nABOUT FELIX 'FX' LINDNER\n\nFX is the leader of the Phenoelit group and loves to hack pretty much everything with a CPU and some communication, preferably networked. He looks back at around fifteen years of (legal) hacking with only a couple Cisco IOS and SAP remote exploits, tools for hacking HP printers and protocol attacks lining the road. In his day life, Felix 'FX' Lindner runs Recurity Labs GmbH, a security consulting and research company in Berlin, Germany."
