description: "In this GDC 2015 Indie Summit lecture, Flippfly founders Aaron and Forest San Filippo will discuss their efforts to create, fund and promote their debut game, Race the Sun. Through an almost-failed Kickstarter campaign to an unquestionable financial and critical success, they discuss how sometimes a dose of stubbornness is the missing ingredient in indie game success.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
