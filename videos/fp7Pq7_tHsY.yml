language: English
recordingDate: 1501911367
description: 'Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov has a unique place in history as the proverbial "man" in "man vs. machine" thanks to his iconic matches against the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue. Kasparov walked away from that watershed moment in artificial intelligence history with a passion for finding ways humans and intelligent machines could work together. In the spirit of "if you can''t beat''em, join''em," Kasparov has explored that potential for the 20 years since his loss to Deep Blue. Navigating a practical and hopeful approach between the utopian and dystopian camps, Kasparov focuses on how we can rise to the challenge of the AI revolution despite job losses to automation and refuting those who say our technology is making us less human. He includes concrete examples and forward-looking strategies on AI.'
