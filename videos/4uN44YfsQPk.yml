recordingDate: 1483592326
description: "We’ve all seen the Wizard of Oz in some form regardless if it was the old classic or the recreations or story books as children. Oscar Diggs or also known as Oz the Great and Terrible was the most stunning wizard in all of Oz. His wizardry known through all of the land, except Oz was a fake and his entire wizardry an illusion. We are seeing a number of breaches come down to human interaction and the ability to create a fake Oz landscape in order to coax victims into opening a document or clicking a link. This talk goes fun stories of successful campaigns I’ve launched and some of the hilarities around making a perfect Oz world. I’ll be going over the latest and greatest and releasing a brand new version of SET during the talk. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the wonderful world of Oz.\n\nBIO:\nDave loves Chris Hadnagy, a lot… almost too much. He masks it behind a fake love of Bruce Hornsby, but secretly he runs a “I Hate Hornsby” club on the Internet. Similar to Fight Club, its first rule is to not speak about the IHH.  Dave is also the owner and operator of TrustedSec, the creator of SET and an all around amazing guy who gives really good hugs (to those that want them, except for Chris)."
