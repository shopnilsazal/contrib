title: 'GeeCON 2017: Alexander Gallego - Distributed Stream Processing Over Thousands Of Datacenters'
recordingDate: 1502694905
description: 'In this talk, we’ll look at what it takes to create a WAN-first distributed stream processing engine for IoT. Assume that you want to battle the traffic of the Mirai botnet of 623Gbps and do real-time analytics of traffic to inform upstream servers of route changes, etc. In this talk, I’ll share the changes and additions made to concord (concord.io) a C++ streaming engine running on top of Apache Mesos to support a multi-tenant workload. We’ll cover the security, debugging, fleet management of tens of thousands of servers while keeping the Akamai platform isolated from accidental or malicious attacks at millisecond latencies.'
