description: "by Chase Douglas\n\nRails comes with many powerful security protections out of the box, but no code is perfect. This talk will highlight a new approach to web app security, one focusing on a higher level of abstraction than current techniques. We will take a look at current security processes and tools and some common vulnerabilities still found in many Rails apps. Then we will investigate novel ways to protect against these vulnerabilities."
