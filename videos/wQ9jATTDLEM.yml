Sood Security Practitioner - Isec Partners | PhD Candidate MSU\nRichard J. Enbody Associate Professor, Dep't of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University\n\nBotnet designs are becoming more robust and sophisticated with the passage of time. While the security world is grappling with the security threats posed by Zeus and SpyEye, a new breed of botnets has begun to flourish. Present-day botnets such as smoke, ICE-X, NGR, etc use a mix of pre-existing and newly developed exploitation tactics to disseminate infections. Botnets have been successful in bypassing advanced defense mechanisms developed by the industry . This talk will take you to the journey of the lives of present-day botnets. With a good set of demonstrations, we will dissect the crux of upcoming breed of botnets.\n\nAditya K.
