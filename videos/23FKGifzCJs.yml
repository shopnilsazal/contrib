description: "This talk will provide an in-depth treatment of satellite telephony networks from a security perspective. The overall system seems secure, but in reality, it cannot be expected to be fully reliable.\r\n\r\nWe will briefly cover the satellite mobile system architecture, then discuss GMR (GEO-Mobile Radio) system elements, e.g. GSS (Gateway Station Subsystem), MES (Mobile Earth Station), AOC (Advanced Operation Center), and TCS (Traffic Control Subsystem) for GMR-1 systems and NCC (Network Control Center), GW (Gateway), SCF (Satellite Control Facility) and CMIS (Customer Management Information System) for GMR-2 systems.\r\n\r\nFrom there, we will discuss the security issues of GMR system as it shares similar vulnerabilities with GSM--GMR is derived from the terrestrial digital cellular standard GSM and support access to GSM core networks, along with some interesting demos.\r\n\r\nTime permitting, a question and answer session at the end of the presentation will allow participants to cover any additional issues in satellite telephony system they'd like to discuss.\r\n\r\nAbout Jim Geovedi\r\n\r\nBBC News described Jim as a guy who \"doesn't look like a Bond villain... but possesses secrets that some of them might kill for\"."
