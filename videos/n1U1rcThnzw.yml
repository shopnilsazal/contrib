description: "Mozart Could’ve Been an Engineer - Music + Code by Catherine Meyers\n\nWould you hire a musician to build a web app? After this talk, you might not think it’s such a crazy idea. Transitioning from opera singer to software engineer, I was blown away by the parallels between music and code. During this talk, we’ll study these similarities: how we break down elements to learn, use patterns to build, problem solve with creativity, and succeed through persistence and flexibility. We’ll compare “Mary Had a Little Lamb” to a Ruby method and see how Puccini might have coded a Todo app. Warning: parts of this talk may be sung. Yes, you may bring your own instruments."
