description: "Technical View: Comparison of Container Orchestration and Management Systems - Lei Zhang, HyperHQ\n\nThe large-scale cluster orchestration management has been evolved to a new age which is represented by open source projects like Kubernetes working with containers like Docker. This presentation will provide a detailed comparison between the design and implementation of Kubernetes, Swarmkit, Mesos, and legacy Swarm+Compose from a technical view. We will also explain the pros & cons of each system, the scenarios where users might want to use one or combination of these systems. What's more, the last part of this presentation will talk about the design of Borg and how it deeply influenced the idea of Kubernetes and other projects. We hope audiences can learn the way we figure out these differences besides the comparison result.\n\nAbout Lei Zhang\nLei is a Phd candidate and the feature maintainer of Kubernetes project. He once worked for cloud team in VMware and Baidu, and now for open source community which mainly focuses on Kubernetes scheduling and kubelet on the upstream as well as maintaining HyperContainer runtime which is also known as Hypernetes & kubernetes/frakti project. As a active community advocator, Lei is the Microsoft MVP of 2016, the Top Star Speaker of InfoQ Container Conference in 2015, and once published the book \"Docker and Kubernetes Under The Hood\" which is the best seller of container cloud area in China."
