description: "What storytelling possibilities can AR technologies and techniques offer to VR developers right now? And how can we design experiences and immersive narratives for VR and beyond, in preparation for a future of VR/AR convergence where users will be able to customise their own level of reality? In this 2016 VRDC talk, Rob Morgan, writer of the first PS3 AR 'Wonderbook' titles and the upcoming VR title 'The Assembly', shows how narrative techniques developed in AR can help overcome the challenge of creating 'emotional immersion' in VR.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
