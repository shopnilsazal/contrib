description: 'Baskin Robbins wishes it had as many flavors as there are JS frameworks, build tools, and cool new "low-level" languages.

Don''t flip that table, because we''ll use the "hype cycle" and the history of Ruby and Rails as a guide to help you understand which front-end and back-end technologies are a fit for your needs now and in the future.'
