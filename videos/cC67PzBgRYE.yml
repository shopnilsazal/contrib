title: 'Rails Conf 2013 How to Write Documentation for People That Don''t Read'
recordingDate: 1369259109
description: "By Kevin Burke\n\nUsability researchers have known for years that people browsing the Internet \ndon't read things word by word - they scan pages for the content they want. Yet \nmany API's and documentation resources are written as though users are reading \nevery word. If busy users can't find what they are looking for, you'll have \nmore support tickets (an expense), or more frustration (lost revenue).\nWriting effective documentation requires knowing who your users are and how \nthey are finding answers to their questions. In this presentation, we'll \nexamine practical techniques to make your documentation work for busy users. \nLooking at examples and user testing from our experience at Twilio, attendees will learn:\n- how users find (or fail to find) your documentation \n- how users view and get started (or fail to get started) with your product \n- how to take advantage of underused documentation tools like your error messages, your API, and SEO.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGai/"
