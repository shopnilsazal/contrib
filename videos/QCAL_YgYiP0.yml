description: "Jason Scott - You're Stealing It Wrong! 30 Years of Inter-Pirate Battles\nHistorian Jason Scott walks through the many-years story of software piracy and touches on the tired debates before going into a completely different direction - the interesting, informative, hilarious and occasionally obscene world of inter-pirate-group battles. A multi-media extravaganza of threats, CSI-level accusations and evidence trails, decades of insider lingo, and demonstrations of how the more things change, the more they still have to keep their ratios up.\n\nJason Scott is a computer historian and proprietor of TEXTFILES.COM, a collection of computer history. This is a pretty good pairing, actually. He also creates documentaries on computer history and attends and speaks at conventions like DEFCON, making computer history. If you see him at DEFCON the choice is clear: talk to him about his cat.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
