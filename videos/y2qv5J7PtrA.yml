description: "Andrew Godwin\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/28/view_talk\nDjango's new Channels feature takes Django beyond the world of HTTP's request-response protocol and into the modern Web protocol world of WebSockets and real-time communication - but it also does a lot more. Learn how Django can now respond to WebSockets, emails or instant messages as easily as HTTP, and we re-architected Django to support all these changes while keeping a clean API and backwards compatibility, and the implications it has for the wider Python ecosystem."
