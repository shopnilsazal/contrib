Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nGood Enough for the Finance Industry: Achieving High Security at Scale with Microservices in Kubernetes - Zachary Arnold & Austin Adams, Ygrene Energy Fund (Any Skill Level)\n\nSecurity is a challenge for most companies. Especially those in periods of rapid growth. It is often taken for granted as we trust the frameworks we use to implement the necessary security protocols for us. However, one only needs to pick up the paper to find out that this simply isn't true. Information security is now a chief concern of many small and mid-size companies as well. We'll show you how we use AWS, Calico, OWASP Dependency Checker, CoreOS&rsquo;s Clair, and Notary to achieve reliable observable security at the code level, container level, cluster level, and even the AWS account level to maintain the Gold Standard of security (authentication, authorization, and auditing.) We will focus on the security mindset and the specific implementation we have at Ygrene to keep data secure.\n\nAbout Zach\nZach works currently for Ygrene Energy Fund as a Platform Engineer spearheading the organization's adoption of Kubernetes for production workloads. He works on championing the Microservice movement at Ygrene and is helping to establish information security best practices for the entire PACE industry. He is fascinated by all things Information Security, IOT, Distributed Systems, and his personal hobby is creating Machine Learning models to do all kinds of interesting learning tasks at Ygrene and elsewhere.\n\nAbout Austin\nSoftware Engineer with 7 years professional experience. People oriented, fast learning and excited to challenge tough problems with modern solutions. Able to lead and follow, has management experience and knows how to see a project through all stages of execution. Loves to have fun, be with family and work in the community. Family man with dreams to have a mini farm and create a sustainable living environment."
