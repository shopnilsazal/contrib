description: "Building Helm Charts From the Ground Up: An Introduction to Kubernetes [I] - Amy Chen, Heptio\n\nLearn the basics of Kubernetes from the perspective of creating a Helm Chart from scratch! \n\nThe Kubernetes cluster will be launched from Rancher, an open source container management software. At the end of this workshop, you will have a functional understanding of pods, services, deployments, Helm, Rancher, and more!\n\nWhy learn Kubernetes with Helm Charts? \nMuch of today's beginner educational content for Kubernetes uses the Kubernetes CLI tool. This can make it hard to visualize the relationship between each command and debug your cluster. Learning how to incrementally build Helm Charts provides a bigger picture of your cluster and is more reproducible.\n\nWhy is Rancher cool? \nRancher makes it easy to configure, deploy and manage Kubernetes, on any infrastructure! \n\nI'm in, what are we doing?\n- Gain a high level understanding of key Kubernetes concepts accompanied with a lot of diagrams\n- Gain an understanding of Rancher's open source container management platform\n- Incrementally build a Nginx Helm Chart\n- Deploy Nginx from a Kubernetes cluster managed by Rancher\n\nAbout Amy Chen\nAmy Chen is a systems software engineer at heptio.
