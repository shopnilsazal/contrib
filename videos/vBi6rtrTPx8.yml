description: "By Mark Menard\nTo paraphrase Mark Twain, \"I didn't have time to write some small classes, so I wrote a BIG ONE instead.\" Now what do you do? Refactor! In this talk we'll refactor some large classes into a series of smaller classes. We'll learn techniques to identify buried abstractions, what to extract, what to leave behind, and why delegation, composition and dependency injection are key to writing small things that are easier to test.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG16/"
