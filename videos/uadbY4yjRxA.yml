title: 'DEF CON 15 - Steve Orrin - The SOA XML Threat Model'
recordingDate: 1391483864
description: "STEVE ORRIN: The SOA/XML Threat Model and New XML/SOA/Web 2.0 Attacks & Threats\nOrganizations that are implementing XML based systems, Web Services, Web 2.0 applications are discovering that there are security challenges unique to them that can surface throughout the various phases of lifecycle. Traditional network and application protection and infrastructure systems lack the functionality, performance, and operational efficiencies needed to provide a secure, cost effective solution. Web Services, SaaS and SOA provide significant benefits and efficiencies to organizations that implement them. However they also introduce new risk structures not seen in other applications or technology solutions before. This session investigates the nature of XML, Web Services and next generation threats, including a new threat model for categorizing and classifying threat types, attack vectors, and risks. The session covers new and evolving attacks and the potential damage and loss that they can cause. These include Payload, Semantic and Structural XML based attacks, as well as some Web 2.0 attacks and next generation worm threats.\n\nSteve Orrin is Director of Security Solutions, for SSG's SPI group at Intel, Corp. and is responsible for Security Platforms and security strategy and product direction.
