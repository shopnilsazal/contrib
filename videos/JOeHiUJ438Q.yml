description: "Robert E. Lee & Jack C. Louis: Introducing Unicornscan - Riding the Unicorn\n\nUnicornscan is an open source (GPL) tool designed to assist with information gathering and security auditing. This talk will contrast the real world problems we've experienced using other tools and methods while demonstrating the solutions that Unicornscan can provide.\n\nWe will use Unicornscan to collect information from large networks, data mine the collected information, and test systems for susceptibility to specific vulnerabilities.\n\nSome of the more interesting content includes:\n\n- An introduction to the Scatter Connect method of TCP Connection State information tracking.\n- How to get more mileage out of the information contained inside the TCP stream for OS and possibly application fingerprinting.\n- How to avoid the kernel fixing packets that we have specifically created to be invalid.\n- How to deliver platform specific exploits using just the information from one Target response packet (SYN/ACK).\n- How to take stable working exploits and use Unicornscan as a delivery agent. \n\nDuring the talk we will release a new DEF CON specific version of Unicornscan that contains many enhancements that we will demonstrate during the talk. The DEF CON version will also contain a couple of special payload configuration files not included in the standard release. To get the most out of this talk attendees should have a strong working knowledge of TCP/IP, C programming, assembly, and OS Application fingerprinting techniques.\n\nRobert E.
