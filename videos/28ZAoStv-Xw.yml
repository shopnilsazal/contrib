description: "How feature flags can be used incorrectly for disastrous results, and how NOT to have this happen to you.\n\nFeature flags are a valuable DevOps technique to deliver better, more reliable software faster. Feature flags can be used for both release management (dark launches, canary rollouts, betas) as well as long term control (entitlement management, user segmentation personalization). However, if not managed properly, feature flags can be very destructive technical debt. Feature flags need to be managed properly with visibility and control to both engineering and business users."
