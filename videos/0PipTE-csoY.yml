description: "by Luca Pradovera\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nIn the modern real time communication world, WebRTC is being paired withmultiple channels and services to provide an unparalleled customer experience.Utilizing automated speech recognition allows us to build advanced assistiveservices such as real time captioned phone calls for hearing impaired people,simultaneous translation tools and automated bot assistants. All of that canbe achieved leveraging modern open source software such as Adhearsion, theRuby telephony application framework, FreeSWITCH, Flite, PocketSphinx and(optionally) external APIs such as IBM Watson. Our experience in developingthat kind of service will be presented and discussed, plus code samples and alive demo.\n\nWrapping FreeSWITCH's WebRTC capabilities with Adhearsion acting as the calllogic and the \"glue\" between parts makes creating rich ASR-enabledapplications easier. Adhearsion allows you to leverage the full power of Rubyto access APIs, send messaging and updates, and use databases. IntegratingFreeSWITCH with third party APIs who do not provide a direct interface, suchas IBM Watson and Wit.ai, through Adhearsion and Ruby. ASR and sentimentanalysis will provide our IVRs with an unparalleled ability to not onlyunderstand what callers say, but also what their desires and intent are.Dialplan applications can be complex to set up to use those APIs, and webapplications are not well suited to that type of application. Adhearsion, theRuby voice application framework, makes it easy and fun!\n\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 15:45:00"
