description: "Accelerating Humanitarian Relief with Kubernetes [I] - Erik Schlegel & Christoph Schittko, Microsoft\n\nHow can UN humanitarian aid field experts use social media to gain insight, understand trends and track key humanitarian issues? Through a collaboration with Microsoft and UN OCHA, Project Fortis was created to accelerate the surveillance around humanitarian disasters and health epidemics around the world.\nThis talk discusses the architecture of a high-available native spark pipeline running across multiple Kubernetes clusters to support Fortis customers.\n\nAbout Christoph Schittko\nChristoph Schittko is an engineer with Microsoft working with customers on innovative solutions in the areas of containerization and AI. He's been working with Microsoft customers on building cloud solutions since Azure was called \"Red Dog\". Heâ€™s recently been a contributor to kubernetes and the Azure Container Service. Prior to joining Microsoft he was an MVP award winner, built a web conferencing system before WebEx and taught machines to recognize things in images. Christoph lives in Dallas where he enjoys plenty of sunshine, great food and very German things like beer and the best place to watch soccer in the US.\n\nAbout Erik Schlegel\nErik is an open source engineer at Microsoft, and based in the Austin area. He's one of the original contributors to the React Native Universal Windows Platform (UWP). Erik leads the engineering effort of Project Fortis, an open source data gathering / surveillance insight platform running on Kubernetes and built with React, Spark and other machine learning technologies.
