description: "\"Network visualization and automation\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - Arengo]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nNetwork automation and orchestration is the latest phase in the evolution of IP and optical networks.\nOver the last few years, network engineers have created a variety of libraries and softwares to help them with the management, configuration and automation of huge networks made of hundreds of thousands of network devices (e.g. routers, switches, antenna...).\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce NetDim, a vendor-neutral software for network modeling and automation based on the standard Python library for GUI programming: tkinter.\n\nI will start the presentation with an introduction to network visualization, and show how tkinter can be used to implement graph drawing algorithms, as well as a full-on Geographic Information System (GIS), allowing one to place network devices on a world map at their GPS coordinates.\n\nI will then discuss the whys and wherefores of network automation, and show how to automatically generate and push scripts to a network device via SSH or Telnet.\n\nMore details about NetDim on github https://github.com/mintoo/NetDim and on this website http://netdim.fr\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
