description: "LLVM-based JIT compiler for MRI byTakashi Kokubun\n\nJIT compiler is considered a promising approach to achieve Ruby 3x3 goal these days. But the direction of its implementation is not fixed yet. What will be the ideal approach to achieve that goal?\n\nIn this talk, seeing my experiment to implement LLVM-based JIT compiler, you'll know how native code can be compiled from YARV ISeq, what makes it fast in LLVM, what are the difficulties underlying in it and how to solve them. I hope a discussion in this talk will help Ruby 3 to be great."
