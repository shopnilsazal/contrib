description: "by Martin Stein\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nA fundamental aspect of the Genode OS project always was the support forvarious kernels as back-end. It remarkably raised testing versatility andprovided a high flexibility to users and developers. But supporting the GenodeAPI on self-contained third-party kernels is sometimes also accompanied withdeficiencies, redundancies, or work-arounds. To also have the option of abasic kernel without such compromises, the custom Genode kernel was developed.Its main distinguishing mark may be that it not only trusts the Genode Core-component but even more is a mere library to it. The implications of this newdesign and other characteristics of the custom Genode kernel, such asscheduling, capabilities, and ARM virtualization, are discussed in thislecture.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 09:45:00"
