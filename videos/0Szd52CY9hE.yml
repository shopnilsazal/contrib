description: "RubyConf 2016 - You Have the Empathy of a Goat: Documenting for the User by Tara Scherner De La Fuente \n\nAre you the sort of developer who makes the user want to headbutt the computer or hop happily sideways? Documentation is often one of the least favorite activities of a developer, and it’s probably always going to suck for some people. But it doesn’t have to give you the bleat-down. We’ll cover: how to discover what the user wants, how to convey what the user needs, what we’re doing wrong, and then we’ll outline the winning formula. If things go really well with your empathetic documentation, you can reduce costs, justify a salary increase, and even become famous. No, really. I’m not KIDding."
