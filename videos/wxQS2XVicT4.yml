recordingDate: 1505711193
description: "The Internet and the security industry have been on fire for the last several months with threats that are plaguing the Internet: worms and SMB vulnerabilities. Wait is it 2017 or 2003? It’s obvious that we are failing at basic security. Case in point: 991,812. That’s how many internet-connected hosts were listening on port 445 as of May 19th 2017.\n\nThis talk will discuss how everything is cyclical and the last handful of years we have regressed from strong security controls to one of data access and holes in firewalls. The slippery slope between data access, security, and the latest and greatest protections have lead to a place where everyone is obsessed with being attacked by 0-day, while leaving SMB open on the Internet. We will cover some of the current events driving this conversation, the ways this has been repeated in the past, and the things we need to do as security professionals to stop the madness going forward.\n\n===\n\nNick Biasini’s interest in computers and technology started at a young age when he tore apart his parents brand new 486SX PC. Ever since he has been tinkering with computers in one way or another.\n\nNick started down the path of information systems in college and has spent his professional career working in information security. Nick has spent time in most roles in a SOC including analyst, engineer, and managing teams. Nick has a master’s degree in digital forensics from the University of Central Florida and has worked for government and private sector environments in his career.\n\nIn his time with Talos Nick has researched a wide range of topics including Exploit Kits and various malware campaigns being distributed through SPAM."
