Aerosource is a project hosting environment built on open source tools including Apache, FreeBSD, PostgreSQL, Python, and Trac. We will share our experiences and successes at promoting open source methods in a traditionally closed environment.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development.
