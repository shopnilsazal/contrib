Some experts suggest such attacks could be effective - others say that targetted country-wide cyberterrorism is just for the movies...or a Tom Clancy book.

The talk will include an online demo of a framework designed to perform closely focussed country-wide cyber attacks.\n\nRoelof Temmingh is the technical director of SensePost where his primary function is that of external penetration specialist.
