title: 'Ruby Conf 2011 Release Early and Release Often: Reducing deployment friction by Andy Delcambre'
recordingDate: 1319660390
description: 'At Engine Yard, we release the main AppCloud code base at least once a day, many times more often than that. Yet we still have a fairly rigorous testing and release process. We have simply automated and connected as much of the process as possible. In this talk I will discuss how we do our deployments and how it ties in with our continuous integration service, and how we automated and tied it all together.'
