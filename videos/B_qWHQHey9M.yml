description: "PyData NYC 2015\n\nLearn how to create shareable applications and dashboards on top of your Python data science stack using IPython Widgets.\n\nThe bridge between your data and your teammates is a critical, yet often overlooked component of good data science. IPython Widgets empower individuals with little background in front-end development to rapidly deploy applications and dashboards directly from their Python data science environment. In this talk, I'll show how you can use widgets turn a notebook running on a JupyterHub server into a fully functional internal application, complete with customizable visualizations and prompts. I'll also provide tips on formatting widgets and polishing your application's UI.\n\nSlides available here: https://github.com/ACampbell22/widgetsapp/blob/master/ipywidgets_app_bootstrap.ipynb"
