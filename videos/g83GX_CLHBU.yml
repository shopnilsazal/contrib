description: "Since I started working in the larger security field, I’ve worked as a scripting monkey, as a malware analyst, as a reverse engineer, as a threat detection specialist; I analyzed nation state threats, did incident response for hospitals, wrote tools and looked into CPU bugs. I taught non-intentional male-only reverse engineering classes, and fully-intentional women-only reverse engineering classes. I tried to build projects on top of broken tools, got upset about it, and calmed down again. There are many other issues I got upset with too, oh dear, the things I’ve seen I’m telling you; and calmed down again. Can’t fix the world with a sledge hammer. Or can we?\n\n=== \n\nMarion Marschalek is a former malware analyst and reverse engineer, who recently started work at Intel in order to conquer the field of low level security research. She has spoken at all the conferences and such, and seen all the things, and if you want more details on her current activities you’ll have to find your way around Intel’s law department. Also, she runs a free reverse engineering workshop for women, because the world needs more crazy researchers \\m/"
