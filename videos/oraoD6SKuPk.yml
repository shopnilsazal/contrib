description: "Where we’re going… we won’t need passwords…\n\nThis session will cover a real-word approach to an enterprise wide, multi-factor authentication deployment at a fortune 500 financial services company with 30,000+ workforce. We’ll discuss the technical challenges we faced in adapting modern passwordless authentication protocols such as SAML and Kerberos to a wide range of client computing devices and legacy technologies.
