description: "Why So Loud! Geeking Out On Airline Data, Physics And Mapping by Ewan Dennis\n\nWe were looking for a new place to live in sunny Scotland. I found myself eerily familiar with our preferred town because it’s on the local airport approach path.\n\nWhat followed was a nerd montage of tracking flight paths by API, researching jet noise propagation effects, plotting heatmaps and making family relocation plans.\n\nThis talk is that story.\n\nEwan is a career geek/autodidact with some pretty varied experience (scientific visualisation, games, app security, cloud infra) who has been remiss in the extreme about giving back to the community that spawned him. Ewan’s mission now is to share all the interesting tech ideas he can; to engage, entertain, encourage, support and wherever possible to engender the same ooh-howz-that-thing-work inquisitiveness he feels every day. Ewan can be found on Twitter with longer occasional outpourings on CloudyGoo."
