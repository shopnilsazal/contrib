description: "By James Turnbull \r\n\r\n\r\nDevOps is a new concept that has emerged in the Development and Operations community. It calls for closer relations between developers and operations people with a view toward improving the quality of the services we provide.\r\n\r\nI'll introduce the tenants of DevOps:\r\n\r\n    * Simplicity\r\n    * Relationships\r\n    * Process, automation, tooling\r\n    * Continuous improvement\r\n\r\nI'll also focus on automation and tooling and especially some of the more interesting open source projects (and people!) that make DevOps possible: configuration management tools, monitoring, metrics management and visualisation.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'll cover some of the critiques, criticisms and FUD throw at DevOps and why the concepts are more than just marketing.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
