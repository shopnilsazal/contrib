title: 'Rails Conf 2013 An Intervention for ActiveRecord by Ernie Miller'
recordingDate: 1369197630
description: "Let's be honest: ActiveRecord's got issues, and it's not going to deal with them on its own. It needs our help.\nDon't think so? Let's take a closer look together. We'll examine the myriad of perils and pitfalls that await newbie and veteran alike, ranging from intentionally inconsistent behavior to subtle oddities arising from implementation details.\nOf course, as with any intervention, we're only doing this because we care. At the very least, you'll learn something you didn't know about ActiveRecord, that helps you avoid these gotchas in your applications. But I hope that you'll leave inspired to contribute to ActiveRecord, engage in discussion about its direction with the core team, and therefore improve the lives of your fellow Rails developers.\nWARNING: We will be reading the ActiveRecord code in this talk. Not for the faint of heart.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGa8/"
