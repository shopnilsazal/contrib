language: English
recordingDate: 1520770253
description: "by Colin Charles\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nAs proxies (and database routers) go, the first one I ever used was the nowdeprecated MySQL Proxy. Since then, I've managed to use MariaDB MaxScale quitea bit (including its fork AirBnB MaxScale), played around with ProxySQL inrecent time, and also started taking a look at MySQL Router. In this quick20-minute overview, we'll discuss why these three exist, a feature comparison,and reasons when to use the right tool for the job.\n\n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 13:05:00"
