One of our goal at Babylon is to make healthcare more affordable by providing, amongst other AI powered tools, a medical chatbot that produces an accurate diagnosis of symptoms reported through an app. \n\nIn this talk we’ll explore the challenges in building and maintaining a medical knowledge base. We will share some valuable lessons learnt in using streams and graph databases to store and process medical data and show how such tools are integrated in our inference tasks and machine learning applications."
