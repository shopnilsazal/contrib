description: "Our Ruby world is becoming increasingly service oriented. Even in trivial applications, we often glue on multiple services ranging from Twitter to AWS. Services can, however, be confusing to test.\n\nMany questions arise such as: How thoroughly should I test a service? Should I stub out responses or consume an API in test mode? How do I know a service is returning what I believe it returns?\n\nIn this talk, I answer these questions and more so that you may test services more effectively.\n\nI am an independent consultant who slings Ruby code for a variety of clients. In the past, I have worked as a developer at thoughtbot and ZURB. I was developing on the web back when marquees were cool.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1F/"
