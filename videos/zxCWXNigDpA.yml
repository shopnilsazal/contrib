description: "Brendan Gregg, Netflix\n\nThere's limited time for performance analysis in the emergency room. When there is a performance-related site outage, the SRE team must analyze and solve complex performance issues as quickly as possible, and under pressure. Many performance tools and techniques are designed for a different environment: an engineer analyzing their system over the course of hours or days, and given time to try dozens of tools: profilers, tracers, monitoring tools, benchmarks, as well as different tunings and configurations. But when Netflix is down, minutes matter, and there's little time for such traditional systems analysis. As with aviation emergencies, short checklists and quick procedures can be applied by the on-call SRE staff to help solve performance issues as quickly as possible."
