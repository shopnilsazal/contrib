recordingDate: 1502694900
description: 'For years there have been voices calling out Akka - the most popular implementation of te Actor Model in the JVM world, for having its interctions loosely typed. This has now changed with the final introduction of the new akka-typed module and with typed persistence module, currently under construction. Akka Typed also comes with a new, behavior-driven philosophy that requires developers and architects to re-think their ideas about actors. How to design & implements actors with that new mindset? How to model & type actor interactions? Answers to this & more in this humble presentation. The talk will take around 60 minutes and is aimed at an advanced audience. Solid understanding of Scala and Akka is required to fully understand it. It will include code samples illustating the Akka Typed API as well as the behavior-driven actor design.'
