description: "Narratives can have a powerful effect on players. This 2014 GDC session from grad student Kim Shashoua explores some of the emotional and psychological benefits players may experience when playing games. Through a few simple mechanisms, popular games give players the chance to better understand their thoughts, gain skills and adopt new perspectives.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
