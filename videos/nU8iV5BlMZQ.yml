description: "Christopher Lopes\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2016/netfringe/sfcxqq/\n\"This session will share my experience building the same small web application using .NET Core, Clojure and Elixir from a Linux environment. The purpose is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of getting started in each framework, from the prospective of someone new and only devoting a cursory look at each, and then apply this information to ASP.NET Core, with the goal of providing a call to action to the community for improving this experience.\n\nIn this session I will share stories of my experience from installation to deployment. It will include a brief overview of each language and framework as well as the tools and libraries used. The steps used to create the application will be discussed along with the decisions made at each step, including wrong paths traveled. It will examine the challenges faced along the way and how they were overcome. It will also include successes as well as what was found to be simple and enjoyable. It will examine the role of the community and how they aided during this endeavor. Along the way sample code of the application will be shared. The session will conclude with a list of takeaways.\""
