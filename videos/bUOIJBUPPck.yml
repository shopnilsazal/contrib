description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nKata Containers: Getting Involved with the Kata Community - Anne Bertucio, OpenStack & Samuel Ortiz, Intel (Any Skill Level)\n\nKata Containers is a new open source project that combines the security of VMs with the speed of containers by providing extremely lightweight VMs for each container, while meeting OCI standards. This approach allows for true, hardware-backed isolation between containers -- a must for many multi-tenant or regulated environments. In this session, Kata Containers community leaders will introduce opportunities for newcomers to contribute to the project, including code contribution, community engagement, documentation, and more. Come learn how you can get involved!\n\nAbout Samuel\nN/A\n\nAbout Anne\nI work at the OpenStack Foundation where I work on both the OpenStack and Kata Containers projects. I help organize the communities, work with newcomers to navigate resources and start contributing, and lead release communications."
