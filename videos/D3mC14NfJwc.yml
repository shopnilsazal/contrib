Do you actually use it every day and wonder what the internets have against it?\n\nIn the last year Ember Data was refreshed, rebooted and is now better focused, slimmer and more approachable. This talk will walk you through the ideas behind the new Ember Data, help you decide whether it is right for you, and teach you how to easily extend it to suit your needs.\n\nNote: You can currently find a work-in-progress transcript for this video at\n\nhttps://github.com/confreaks/translations/blob/master/2014-emberconf/3300-emberconf2014-ember-data-and-the-way-forward-cc\n\nIn its current form, it should make the video much easier to follow. However, certain words and phrases are unclear and marked as such with time stamps.\n\nClosed captions to the video are up and coming.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2x/"
