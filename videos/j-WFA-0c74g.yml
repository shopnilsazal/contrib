title: '#HITB2017AMS COMMSEC D1 - Fault Injection Attacks On Secure Boot - Niek Timmers and Albert Spruyt'
recordingDate: 1493972817
description: "Todayâ€™s standard embedded technology is not resilient against basic hardware fault injection attacks. Such attacks alter the intended behavior of a chip by manipulating its environmental conditions. Typically this is done by  manipulating the power supply voltage, but more advanced techniques use electro-magnetic or optical pulses.\n\nCode bases which are executed at the highest privilege level are of special interest to attackers, because modified behavior can have much impact on the security of the whole system. Whereas common software vulnerabilities are very powerful, such code is typically well protected against pure logical attacks. An example is secure boot, a common embedded system security feature to assure the integrity and confidentiality of all code executed after power-on reset. With fault injection it is possible to override restrictions or skip protective code, which enables a hostile takeover of the system.\n\nThis talk provides an introduction to fault injection attacks on embedded  systems and explains their impact on secure boot using multiple practical examples. As a key take away from this talk we present practical mitigation techniques for implementers of secure boot to lower the probability of a successful attack.\n\n===\n\nNiek Timmers is a Senior Security Analyst at Riscure where he analyzes and tests, among other things, the security of System-on-Chips (SoC) and Embedded Systems. At the moment his primary research topic is fault injection on feature rich chips. However, never a week goes by without disassembling, analyzing or emulating some random binary. Shared his research at multiple conferences such as FDTC and Black Hat.\n\n---\n\nAlbert Spruyt is a Senior Security Analyst at Riscure, where he tries to best systems. He is fascinated by the area where crypto rubber meets the hardware road. Where he builds stuff to take things apart. Spoke at HITB before."
