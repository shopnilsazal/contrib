description: "By, Jeremy Flores\nWorking remotely—full or part time, across town or across timezones—takes a special set of skills that develop with practice. Remote work further blurs the lines of work/life balance in an already grey industry. With the right tools, you can sustainably keep your balance and stay focused and energized without burning out. I've done it multiple times with multiple groups and experienced a multitude of results. I've tallied my experiences into a set of guidelines to help you, the new remote worker, do things like:\n\n✦ build team engagement—without being gabby—by recognizing and focusing on relevant conversations.\n\n✦ grow a voice to which others respond by knowing yourself and what sets you apart.\n\n✦ advocate your needs by illustrating added value to others and yourself.\n\n✦ integrate into an existing culture by exposing expertise and exuding affability,\n\n✦ and push that culture in a healthy direction by using your voice and expertise.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGYU/"
