description: "Developers are under constant duress to make their games cheat free. In the world of early access, modding, free to play and multiplayer this is no small feat. Cheating has become a business, a problem that affects a lot of games, and pushes us to extreme measures and rather harsh decisions. Presented by Eugen Harton at GDC Europe, this is a story of Bohemia Interactive's fight against cheaters during the development of hit title DayZ. \nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
