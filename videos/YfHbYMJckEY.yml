description: "Eric Goldman - Criminal Copyright Infringement and Warez Trading\nCriminal Copyright Infringement and Warez Trading\n\nThis talk will discuss criminal copyright infringement and how it applies to warez trading. We will discuss what is legal and what isn't, who has been prosecuted, why they were prosecuted and what happened to them, and why the law is bad policy. You should expect to leave the talk more knowledgeable about what activities are criminal and how great or small the risks are.\n\nEric Goldman is an assistant professor of law at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, WI, where he teaches cyberlaw, intellectual property and legal ethics. He has taught cyberlaw since 1995-96 and has authored dozens of articles and given dozens of speeches relating to Internet law issues. His article, A Road to No Warez: the Paradigm Misstep of the No Electronic Theft Act, will be published this year. Prior to joining the Marquette faculty, he was General Counsel of Epinions.com and, before that, a technology transactions attorney at Cooley Godward LLP."
