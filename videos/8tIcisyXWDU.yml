title: 'Modern Big Data Pipelines over Kubernetes [I] - Eliran Bivas, Iguazio'
recordingDate: 1513373909
description: "Modern Big Data Pipelines over Kubernetes [I] - Eliran Bivas, Iguazio\n\nBig data used to be synonymous with Hadoop, but our ecosystem has evolved over time with new database, streaming and machine learning solutions which donâ€™t necessarily benefit from the Hadoop deployment model of Map/Reduce, YARN and HDFS. These solutions require a generic cluster scheduling layer to host multiple workloads such as Kafka, Spark and TensorFlow, alongside databases such as Cassandra, Elasticsearch and cloud-based storage. \n\nEliran Bivas is a senior big data architect with years of hands-on experience working on both big data and cloud native solutions. Eliran will go over a common solution framework to create cloud native end-to-end analytics applications. It involves using Kubernetes as an alternative to Yarn, running Spark, Presto, machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Python and Spark ML kits) and serverless functions coupled with local and cloud-based storage. The session will showcase customer use-cases from IoT, automotive, cloud SaaS and finance. It will also include a live solution demo which demonstrates the benefits of using big data and analytics over a cloud native architecture, eliminating the existing challenges of complexity and moving towards a continuous integration and development architecture for big data.\n\nAbout Eliran Bivas\nEliran Bivas is a senior big data architect at iguazio and a self-proclaimed tech junkie with a passion for innovation. Eliran is skilled with object-oriented design and development, having worked extensively on cloud native environments. He has broad experience developing with cloud services such as Amazon EC2, Google AppEngine, Heroku and VMware CloudFoundry. Eliran is also savvy with Spark, Presto, Flink and TensorFlow, but his main interests are in JVM languages, Golang, Docker and Kubernetes. Prior to iguazio, Eliran worked at global tech leading companies such as VMware and F5 Networks. He has a B.Sc in Math and Computer Science and an MBA from Bar Ilan University."
