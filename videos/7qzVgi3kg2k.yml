description: "Using Kubo to Manage your Kubernetes Clusters [I] - Oleksandr Slynko & Brendan Nolan, Pivotal\n\nKubo is an OSS project developed jointly by Pivotal and Google. It provides an uniform way to instantiate, deploy, and manage highly available vanilla Kubernetes clusters using BOSH - on GCE, vSphere, AWS, Openstack and Azure.\n\nUsing BOSH and Kubo to manage Kubernetes gives self healing, easily upgradeable clusters with managed secrets rotation. Cluster creation is simplified to the point where clusters can be created and destroyed for use in development or sandbox environments. \n\nIn this presentation, Brendan and Oleksandr will demonstrate deployment across multiple IAASes, cluster healing, cluster upgrade and cluster creation.\n\nAbout Brendan Nolan\nPrincipal Software Engineer, Pivotal.io\n\nAbout Oleksandr Slynko\nStaff Software Engineer, Pivotal\nOleksandr has been working as Software engineer for 11 years. He has worked in Pivotal on Kubo since the project inception. He has background in automation and working on high available cloud solutions."
