recordingDate: 1430417756
description: "By, Aja Hammerly\nLike most programmers I am lazy. I don't want to do something by hand if I can automate it. I also think DevOps can be dreadfully dull. Luckily there are now tools that support lazy DevOps. I'll demonstrate how using Docker containers and Kubernetes allows you to be lazy and get back to building cool features (or watching cat videos). I'll go over some of the pros and cons to the \"lazy\" way and I'll show how these tools can be used by both simple and complex apps.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/G6rF/"
