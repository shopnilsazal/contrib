description: "by Stefan Schmidt\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nAdding support for IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN to an embedded Linux board opensup new possibilities to communicate with tiny devices. The mainline kernelsupports the wireless protocols to connect such devices to the internet,acting as border router for such networks.\n\nThis talk will show how to add the needed transceiver to existing hardware,how to enable and configure the kernel subsystems to use it and how tocommunicate between Linux and IoT operating systems like RIOT or Contiki.\n\nAdding support for IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN to an embedded Linux board opensup new possibilities to communicate with tiny, IoT type of, devices.\n\nBringing IP connectivity to devices, like sensors, with just a few kilobytesof RAM and limited battery power is an interesting IoT challenge. With theLinux-wpan and 6LoWPAN subsystems we get Linux ready to support the neededwireless standards as well as protocols that connect these tiny devices intothe wider internet. To make Linux a practical border router or smart home hubfor such networks.\n\nThis talk will show how to add the needed transceiver hardware to an existinghardware and how to enable and configure the Linux-wpan and 6LoWPAN mainlinesubsystems to use it. The demonstration will include setting up thecommunication between Linux and other popular IoT operating systems like RIOTor Contiki as well.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 15:00:00"
