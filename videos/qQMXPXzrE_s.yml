description: "Tony Ibbs | Sunday 10:30 | Ferrier Hall\n\nThere's a long history to text markup languages, and I don't think most people know much of it.\n\nI hope to touch (briefly) on at least nroff/troff, SGML, HTML, Docbook, TeX and LaTeX, setext, reStructuredText, markdown and AsciiDoc.\n\nI shall probably curse briefly about wiki markups.\n\nThe slides, and extended notes, will be available at https://github.com/tibs/markup-history"
