description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\n\nThursday, September 18 â€¢ 3:00pm - 3:45pm\nClient-side security with the Security Header Injection Module (SHIM)\n \nClient-side security headers are useful countermeasures for Man-In-The-Middle, Clickjacking, XSS, MIME-Type sniffing, and Data Caching vulnerabilities. In this talk, we will review several security headers (e.g. Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy, and X-Content-Type-Options) and the various options available for each header. We will then demonstrate a new open source Security Header Injection Module (SHIM) for ASP.NET (developed by the presenters) that can be configured to mitigate the vulnerabilities by setting the security headers for any web application. The SHIM tool will be officially released at AppSec USA.\n\nSpeakers\n\nAaron Cure\nSenior Security Consultant, Cypress Data Defense, LLC\nAaron is a senior security consultant at Cypress Data Defense, and an instructor and contributing author for the CDD Introduction to Internet Security in .NET course.
