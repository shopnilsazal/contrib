Tracy Osborn will talk about the idea of the \"\"Python engineer,\"\" her (long and full of bumps and potholes) journey to learning and teaching Python, and the harmful myths about learning programming and the paths available when you do so.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
