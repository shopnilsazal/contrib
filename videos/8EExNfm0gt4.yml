description: "Adding Even More Fun to Functional Programming With RXJS by Ryan Anklam\n\nWith the rise in popularity of functional programming lately new ways of writing concise and expressive code have emerged. Reactive JavaScript (RXJS) is one of these and takes functional programming a step further by turning events and asynchronous calls into compostable data streams.\nFocusing on how we use RXJS at Netflix, this session will show attendees how to use the 5 pillars of Functional programming: map, mergeAll, filter, reduce, and zip and how they are superior to their imperative counterparts. Attendees will then learn how to use Observable objects to put the \"reactive\" into their functional code to write code that will react to asynchronous calls and events using the RXJS library.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG3E/"
