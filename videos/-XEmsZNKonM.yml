description: "This week, James is joined by friend of the show Dean Ellis, Developer at Microsoft and MonoGame contributor/evangelist, who introduces us to the cross-platform and open source game framework, MonoGame. Dean walks us through how MonoGame took everything that we loved about XNA and created a full cross-platform game framework that runs on iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, Windows, PS4, PSVita, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. It powers some of your favorite games today such at TowerFall, Bastion, and Infinite Flight, and Dean shows us how to get started, how to deploy our first game, and how to run it on all of the platforms.\n\nShow Links:\n\nMonoGame: http://www.monogame.net/\nMonoGame on GitHub: https://github.com/MonoGame\nSource Code from Show: https://github.com/MonoGame/XamarinShowSample\nXamarin's MonoGame Documentation: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/game_development/monogame/\nFollow @InfinitspaceStudios: https://twitter.com/infinitespacestudios\n\nFind James on Twitter: http://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno \nGitHub: http://github.com/jamesmontemagno\nBlog: https://montemagno.com\nand his weekly development podcast Merge Conflict: http://www.mergeconflict.fm\n\nNever Miss an Episode: https://twitter.com/thexamarinshow\nFollow @TheXamarinShow\n\nUseful Links:\n\nXamarin Developer Center & Blog: https://developer.xamarin.com/\nXamarin and Azure: https://www.xamarin.com/azure\nMobile DevOps: https://www.xamarin.com/mobile-devops\nXamarin University Self-Guided: https://university.xamarin.com/self-guided\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree"
