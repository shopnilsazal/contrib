Walt Disney Imagineering, being one of the original pioneers in VR in the late 1980s, has in truth never stopped playing with VR and using it. This lecture from Disney Imagineering's Bei Yang will focus on HMD and CAVE-based experiences from Disney, their design considerations, technical implementation details, and real-world examples.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
