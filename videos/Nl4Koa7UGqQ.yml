description: "by Tristan Gingold\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nYou have no hardware knowledge and want to know how people design chips ? Youare a software guy, having heard of VHDL or Verilog but never used it ? Inthis 25 min tutorial, you will learn the basis of hardware design and how towrite a simple FPGA design using only FOSS tools. (This tutorial is not aboutPCB design, but reprogrammable chips design)\n\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 10:30:00"
