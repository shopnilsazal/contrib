description: "Kubernetes as a Service in Your Own Data Center - Jared Rosoff, VMware\n\nGoogle Container Engine is awesome, but how can you get something similar in your own data center? Over the past year, VMware has built an open-source private cloud platform called Photon that delivers kubernetes as a service on your hardware. We’ll discus the architecture of an enterprise grade kubernetes as a service platform and how we’re solving problems like storage, networking, multi-tenancy, security, high availability and resource management."
