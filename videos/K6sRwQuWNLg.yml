description: "In this session we'll go off the Rails and take a look at what our Pythonista cousins are doing with Django.\nI'll start with some live coding: recreating DHH's infamous 15 minute blog demo using Django and explaining the building blocks of a Django app along the way. I'll then take that app and use it to look at some design decisions Django makes, and how they compare to Rails. You'll see convention over configuration in places you didn't expect it, why Django doesn't need attr_accessible or strong parameters, and how the template method pattern could change your life.\nWhy talk about Python at a Rails conference? Seeing another way of doing things forces us to think about what we're doing, challenges or validates the assumptions we make about our work, and inspires us to try new things.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGag/"
