description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\nFriday, September 19 • 1:00pm - 1:45pm\n\nWhere the Security Rubber Meets the DevOps Road\n \nDevOps is a natural evolution of Agile, Lean, Continuous Integration and other patterns common amongst high performers and continuous process improvement. As someone who has helped dozens of organizations get started with DevOps patterns and tool chains, we will explain where people get started – and therefore where security can inject and support sound practices for the bulk of the adoption curve. This will also serve as a great hand-off to the next talk about the bleeding edge trends and trajectories.\n\n\nSpeaker\n\nDamon Edwards\nCo-Founder, SimplifyOps Inc.\nDamon Edwards is the co-founder and vice president of SimplifyOps, a provider of support and services for the users of the Rundeck open source project. Damon also co-founded and remains active with DTO Solutions, a DevOps and automation engineering consultancy whose clients include leading SaaS, e-commerce, gaming, and financial services companies.
