title: 'Jessica Rudd, Support Vector Machine Modeling & Graph Theory Metrics for Disease Classification'
recordingDate: 1505959049
description: "Currently a PhD student in Analytics and Data Science at Kennesaw State University. Jessica received a B.A. in Anthropology from Emory University and an M.P.H in Global Epidemiology from the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. She has 7 years experience as an Epidemiologist/Biostatistician for the Division of Viral Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nApplication of Support Vector Machine Modeling and Graph Theory Metrics for Disease Classification:\nDisease classification is a crucial element of biomedical research. Recent studies have demonstrated that machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) modeling, produce similar or improved predictive capabilities in comparison to the traditional method of Logistic Regression. In addition, it has been found that social network metrics can provide useful predictive information for disease modeling. In this study, we combine simulated social network metrics with SVM to predict diabetes in a sample of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. In this dataset, Logistic Regression outperformed SVM with ROC index of 81.8 and 81.7 for models with and without graph metrics, respectively. SVM with a polynomial kernel had ROC index of 72.9 and 75.6 for models with and without graph metrics, respectively. Although this did not perform as well as Logistic Regression, the results are consistent with previous studies utilizing SVM to classify diabetes."
