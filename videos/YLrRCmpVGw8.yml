description: "RubyConf 2017: Hello Gmom!: Addressing loneliness in end-of-life care by Jeremy Flores\n\nAfter suffering a debilitating stroke, Barbara, my significant other's grandmother, was left disabled, bed-bound, and mostly non-verbal. We visited often, and were with her when she passed earlier this year. For Christmas, I built her a web application to be a window into the life of her granddaughter.\n\nNow that she’s passed, I’m hoping that the project can be a foundation or inspiration for others to build tools that bring them closer to the people they love. This small project--a $5 computer and some “off-the-shelf” technology--increased the quality of life for all of us."
