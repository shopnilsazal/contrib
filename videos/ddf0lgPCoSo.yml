description: "PyData London 2018\n\nThere are a lot of models for individual word embeddings but few that encode the meaning of the whole sentence. i will introduce InferSent embedding for deciding if one sentence infers another. I will apply it to detecting factual claim sentence in text. It's the first step in automating a fact-checking process at Full Fact as only 15% of political TV subtitles contain verfiable claims.\n\nSlides: speakerdeck.com/tmylk/sentence-embeddings-for-automated-factchecking-pydata-london-2018\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
