description: "Mike \"mckt\" Bailey - Web Services We Just Don't Need\nA barbecue with a built in webserver. Remote command execution via Twitter. Great geek projects, but do we really need them? On the serious side of things, do we really need web-based management interfaces on firewalls, printers, and phone systems? Maybe it's time to take a look at the sometimes-humorous, often-dangerous downsides.\n\nmckt (pronounced \"mckt\") is a three time consecutive winner of the Bill Bilano 'Heeey Dude!' award, and a volunteer with the Mitnick's Children Foundation.\n\nHe often finds himself in harrowing situations involving the stormtroopers of an popular software vendor, but always manages to escape using a rusty backslash and a pack of chewing gum. His mother is disappointed in him, but hopes he'll one day live up to his true potential.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
