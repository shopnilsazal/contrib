language: English
recordingDate: 1509660001
description: 'Metasploit x86 shellcode has been defeated by EMET and other techniques not only in exploit payloads but through using those payloads in non-exploit situations (e.g. binary payload generation, PowerShell deployment, etc..). This talk describes taking Metasploit payloads (minus Stephen Fewer''s hash API), incorporating techniques to bypass Caller/EAF[+] checks (post ASLR/DEP bypass) and merging those techniques together with automation to make something better.'
