recordingDate: 1423237060
description: "By, Paolo Perrotta\n\nA confession: I used Git for months without really understanding what was going on. I knew all the basic commands, but I still got stranded when something went wrong. Why did my rebase fail? How did I manage to mess up the remote? \n\nThen I found the key to Git: the unfamiliar .git directory. That was my lightbulb moment. Once I understood the underlying model, everything about Git clicked into place. Things that used to be baffling and complicated suddenly looked simple and elegant. \n\nLet me share this lightbulb with you. It will take you less than an hour to wrap your head around Git.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GF2r/"
