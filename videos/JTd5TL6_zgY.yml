This is particularly true for organizations that are trying to keep trade secrets. While we hear a lot about personal privacy, little is said in regard to organizational privacy. Organizations, in fact, leak information at a much greater rate than individuals, and usually do so with little fanfare. There are greater consequences for organizations when information is leaked because the secrets often fall into the hands of competitors. This talk uses a variety of real world examples to show how trade secrets are leaked online, and how organizational privacy is compromised by seemingly innocent use of The Internet.\n\nMichael Schrenk is an online Business Intelligence Specialist, who has developed industrial webbots and botnets for the past twenty years. He is a five-time DEFCON speaker, including last year's talk, “How my Botnet Purchased Millions of Dollars in Cars and defeated the Russian Hackers”. Mike is also the author of “Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers”, 2nd Edition (2012, No Starch Press, San Francisco)."
