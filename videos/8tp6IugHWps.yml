description: "I will help set the tone for an exciting conference This creative and interactive kick-off will get all the attendees on the their feet, interacting with each other and having fun! While they are energized, I intend to have them connect and bond with 3 or 4 new people that they will want to stay in touch with far beyond this year's conference. They will start the conference with a good belly laugh!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FwW8/"
