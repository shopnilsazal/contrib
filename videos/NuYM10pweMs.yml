description: "Biohacking at home: Pragmatic DNA design, assembly, and transformation\nKeoni Gandall\n\nIt is predicted that the ability to read/write DNA cheaply at scale will revolutionize biology, but what happens after the DNA has been printed? I will explain the basics of genetic engineering at home and how it can be useful now and in the future. This talk will cover building a basic lab, DNA design and assembly, transformation of actual living organisms, and the relevant safety and security concerns. If time permits, I will talk about open source projects and engineering principles as applied to genetics. I will also briefly explain how this applies to human genome editing, even though I have been referring to the genetic engineering of microbes. This talk should provide you with a better understanding of genetic engineering and how to get started at home or a local hackerspace. \n\nBIO: Keoni Gandall is currently a student at Edison High School as well as an active member of the DIYbio community. Over the past two years, he has worked in the liulab at UCI with in vivo directed evolution systems, at LA Biohackers as a main contributor to their iGEM project, and at home doing independent research & development. In 2013, he won first place at the Broadcom Masters national science fair for creating an Archaea plasmid using his home lab. This is his second year at DEF CON and he is still here to learn, but he is even more excited to share the basics of genetic engineering with the larger hacker community. Keoni is dedicated to the practical development of new biological technologies in the 21st century."
