recordingDate: 1417633732
description: "Ever type 'next' into your debugger and then realize you should have used 'step'? Or perhaps invoked a method that you wish you could take back? Regret no more! Just turn the clock back a few ticks and begin again! With only a few restrictions and side-effects we will learn how to construct and use a time machine.\n\nWARNING: Time travel may cause zombies.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FjVm/"
