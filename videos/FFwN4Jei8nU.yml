description: "Find more information here: http://droidcon.de/session/android-50-internals-and-our-inferiority-complex-0\n\nAs an Android developers we use various frameworks and libraries provided by Google and others. Sometimes they are just a pure magic (say hi to Jake Wharton and his ActionBarShelock!) and sometimes… Well, if we make an effort to grap the source code and go through it, we realise there is no magic there. During my presentation, I will go deep into Lollipop’s new JobScheduler API. See what’s really there, how it’s advertised, and try to assess how big is the gap between us and guys at Google. Should we have any inferiority complex or could we write this code ourselves?"
