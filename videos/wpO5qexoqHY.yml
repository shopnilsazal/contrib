description: "Jayson E. Street - Steal Everything, Kill Everyone, Cause Total Financial Ruin! (Or How I Walked In And Misbehaved)\nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-19/dc-19-presentations/Street/DEFCON-19-Street-Steal-Everything.pdf\n\nThis is not a presentation where I talk about how I would get in or the things I might be able to do. This is a talk where I am already in and I show you pictures from actual engagements that I have been on. They say one picture is worth a thousand words I show you how one picture cost a company a million dollars and maybe even a few lives. In a community where we focus so much on the offensive I also make sure with every attack I highlight. I spend time discussing what would have stopped me. We need to know the problems but we need more talks providing solutions and that is what I hope people will get from this. I show the dangers of Social engineering and how even an employee with no SE experience can be an eBay James Bond which can cause total financial ruin to a company. These Security threats are real. So are these stories!\n\nJayson E. Street is an author of the book \"Dissecting the hack: The F0rb1dd3n Network\" from Syngress. Also creator of the community site http://dissectingthehack.com\n\nHe has also spoken at DEFCON, BRUCON, UCON and at several other 'CONs and colleges on a variety of Information Security subjects.\n\nHis life story can be found on Google under \"Jayson E. Street\".\n\n*He is a highly carbonated speaker who has partaken of Pizza from Beijing to Brazil. He does not expect anybody to still be reading this far but if they are please note he was chosen as one of Time's persons of the year for 2006. ;)\nTwitter: @jaysonstreet\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jayson.e.street"
