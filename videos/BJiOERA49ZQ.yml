recordingDate: 1442606395
description: "Django Views: Functions, Classes, and Generics\n\nThe goal of this talk is to make views and HTTP as clear as daylight. This talk is for you if you're confused about:\n\nhow function views compare to class-based views\nwhen to use generic class-based views-\nthe difference between class-based views and generic class-based views-\nor when to use any of these\nThis talk will start with an introduction to HTTP and how Django handles HTTP. We will then look at each kind of view in Django, focusing on how each works and why Django implements it that way. This will allow us to look at the advantages and shortcomings of each type of view. Finally, with a full understanding of Django views, we will be able to easily determine when to use each type of view.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nWhat is HTTP, anyway?\nDjango's HTTP Request/Response Cycle\nWhat is a callable?\nHistory of View Functions\nFunctions\nGenerics\nClasses and Generics\nView Functions\n(or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Non-Compliance)\nClass Based Views\n(or As DRY as the Sahara)\nGeneric Class Based Views\n(or Oh For The Love of Graph Theory)\nEnhancing Views\n(or 1-Size fits no-one)\nFixing Your Views\nWhen to Use What"
