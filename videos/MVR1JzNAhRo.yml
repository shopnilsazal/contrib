description: "Copy of the slides for this talk are here:https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Street/DEFCON-20-Street-Rockstar.pdf \n\nHow to Channel Your Inner Henry Rollins\nJayson E. Street CIO, Stratagem 1 Solutions\n\nHave you ever found yourself thinking \"Boy I sure wish I could witness a guy rant for 20 minutes and barely come up for air\" or maybe \"I sure wish I could have seen firsthand an old time tent revival with a preacher screaming at me\" Well then great news you are in luck. This is a talk on not just how we need to take a hard look at how we interact with people outside of our field. It also addresses how we can escape the echo chamber and hopefully burn it to the ground as we leave! All presented in a hopefully comical but most likely just ranty way!\n\nJayson E. Street is the author of the book 'Dissecting the Hack: The F0rb1dd3n Network' plus creator of the site http://dissectingthehack.com\n\nHe's also spoken at DEF CON, BRUCON, UCON & at several other CONs & colleges on a variety of Information Security subjects. His life story can be found on Google under 'Jayson E. Street'.\n\nHe's a highly carbonated speaker who has partaken of Pizza from Beijing to Brazil. He does not expect anybody to still be reading this far but if they are please note he was chosen as one of Time's persons of the year for 2006.\nTwitter: @jaysonstreet\nFacebook: jayson.e.street\nhttp://F0rb1dd3n.com"
