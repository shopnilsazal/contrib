description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Renaud Mathieu, Neos.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-50\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/renaudmathieu/quickly-build-your-app-alone-with-firebase-android-makers-2018\n\nCreating a personal Android app requires us to solve a lot of common challenges. Sometimes some of these challenges require so much time that we start to forget about the product we are building. Firebase can act as a toolbox to give functionality like analytics, databases, messaging and crash reporting so we can move quickly and focus on our users.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
