title: 'Pieter Hintjens - Distribution, Scale and Flexibility with ZeroMQ'
recordingDate: 1386948261
description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nToday's cloud and clustering infrastructure has to be distributed, scalable, and flexible. There's no better way to get this than to use ZeroMQ, the messaging library that powers CERN's 26 km particle-smashing accelerator. In this talk, Pieter Hintjens, author of the O'Reilly ZeroMQ book, and contributor to the project, will present ZeroMQ from first principles. Why do we need cheap messaging? What are the messaging patterns? How do we build a huge infrastructure out of small, pluggable pieces? He'll cover discovery, prototyping, protocols, security, and much more.\nTalk objectives:\n\nTo explain the basic techniques of building very large distributed systems using fast asynchronous messaging in general, and ZeroMQ specifically.\nTarget audience:\n\nAnyone designing or building distributed systems, in any language and on any platform."
