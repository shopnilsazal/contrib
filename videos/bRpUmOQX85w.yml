title: 'DEF CON 8 - Aaron Grothe - Tunneling and Firewalls'
recordingDate: 1393399605
description: "Aaron Grothe - Tunneling and Firewalls\n\nA Firewall is the first line of defense for almost every LAN connected to the Internet. Using a Firewall many System Administrators restrict privileges to services they do not want to allow access to such as telnet and ftp. Using tunneling software, people can re-enable those services by establishing virtual data paths through allowed protocols such as http.\n\nThe talk will provide an overview of how tunneling may be used, how to combat it, and when to use it. There will be a demonstration of how tunneling works using the httptunnel http://www.nocrew.org/software/httptunnel.html software.\n\nAaron Grothe is a System Administrator for a small startup based in Omaha, Nebraska. \n\nDEF CON 8.0 was held July 28th - 30th, 2000, in Las Vegas, Nevada USA"
