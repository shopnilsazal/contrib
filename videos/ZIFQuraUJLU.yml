recordingDate: 1384936717
description: "Maximum CTF: Getting the Most Out of Capture the Flag\nPsifertex\n\nAmong all the amazing Defcon competitions, the Capture the Flag contest reigns supreme. Psifertex will examine some of the history of CTF, focusing on the reign of terror pwnage that was the Kenshoto CTF from 2005-2008. The talk will both be technical (including rapid-fire discussions of technical challenges and solutions), and entertaining (expect guest appearances from ninjas and pirates alike). Come hear not only what skills are necessary to succeed at CTF, but how to have the most fun while doing it.\n\nPsifertex's professional security career includes stints as a senior security engineer for a major public university, a security researcher, and he even managed to slip in a few years writing for technical magazines. Through those roles, he has taught reverse engineering, vulnerability research, and web security at multiple universities, government organizations, and conferences. After dark, he likes participating in CTF games, winning the '07 RSA \"Interactive Testing Challenge\", and is very grateful to be a member of the '07-'08 Defcon CTF winning team, 1@stplace.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
