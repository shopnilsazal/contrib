description: 'It''s hard not to use a service now days that doesn''t track your every move and keystroke if you absolutely must use these systems why not give them the most useless information possible. Along with the fact that several companies are tracking their customers online now they are taking it to physical brick and mortar stores this talk will be geared looking at the attack surface of instore tracking and attacking these systems for the purpose of overloading their systems or making the information so inaccurate that it becomes useless. Watch as a 32 year old hackers online profile is turned to that of a 12 year old girl who loves horses!'
