description: "Multi-Cluster Ops in a Hybrid World [A] - Vitaliy Zinchenko & Kire Filipovski, Oracle\n\nThe reality of multiple Kubernetes deployments typically leaves you with varied cluster profiles, deployed on a mix of on-prem and public cloud environments. Production ops for large distributed systems is hard enough in a single environment, but becomes even more complex with hybrid conditions. \nIn this talk, we’ll dissect how to leverage federation for Kubernetes governance across capacity management, micro service dependencies, infrastructure upgrades, versioning, and security, as well as, global high availability, continuity, and resiliency, in a hybrid environment.\n\nAbout Kire Filipovski\nKire Filipovski works as a Cloud Architect at Oracle leading design and implementation of a distributed containerized application management system. Previously Kire worked as a Distinguished Cloud Architect at Walmart where he designed computing platforms that transformed the world's largest company into a digital business.
