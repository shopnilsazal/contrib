description: "A ROOM WITH A VUE\n\nIn this crazy jungle of js frameworks, we got yet another one. Vue.js was officially released in late 2015 and started accumulating followers during 2016. Today it is already released as a 2.0 and a serious contender to React and Angular. I will tell more about this outsider.\n\nMAGNÚS DÆHLEN\n\nMy name is Magnús Dæhlen. I am a consultant at Iterate and is currently a hired gun at Cisco. I just love attention. Probably why I kinda love playing in the band For a While better than IT, but who knows. \n\nIn between music and IT, I try to be a good husband and dad as well as keeping way to many hobbies alive. That’s mostly it."
