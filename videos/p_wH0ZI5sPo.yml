language: English
recordingDate: 1495760057
description: "In DevOps we don't like job titles, so why are we talking about this thing called a DevSecOps Engineer? What does a DevSecOps Engineer do? What skills do they have? What are their responsibilities and goals? If you are a security professional how do you evolve into this role, and most importantly, why would you want to? In this talk, Helen will explore the provenance of this term, its definitions and how to train and certify as a DevSecOps Engineer.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
