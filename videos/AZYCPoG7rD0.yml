description: "Eric Lippert (@ericlippert) and Gor Nishanov (@GorNishanov) discuss C++ co-routines, probabilistic programming, undefined behavior, and more. \n\nEric Lippert was the first dev interviewee on @Ch9. In fact, it was his interview that really made us believe that we were on to something with unscripted conversations in video format... Great to see Eric again! He still has the boyish looks and sly grin. Amazing, the things he and team are working on, which should have impact across the industry.\n\nGor loves C++ and he is quite the personality. His co-routine design is on the path to standardization in C++20. We (Service Fabric team) use his current implementation in many places, including code that runs in the Windows kernel. We love co-routines!. We must get him to spend more time on camera and share his passionate insights.\n\nTune in. Meet Eric and Gor. Two monster programmers working on industry-scale innovations for their respective companies. The happiness of And!\n\n...Charles"
