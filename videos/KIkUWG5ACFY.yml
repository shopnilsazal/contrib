description: "Invited Talk given by Kent Beck of Facebook, Inc., at the 2011 USENIX Federated Conferences Week, held June 14-17, 2011, in Portland, OR.\n\nAbstract:\nAs deployment cycles shrink, what constitutes effective software engineering changes radically. Practices that bring improvement to a quarterly release cycle can be fatal with an hourly release cycle. This talk outlines the changes required of software engineering and organization at different cycle times: quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nKent Beck is the founder and director of Three Rivers Institute (TRI). His career has combined the practice of software development with reflection, innovation, and communication. His contributions to software development include patterns for software, the rediscovery of test-first programming, the xUnit family of developer testing tools, and Extreme Programming. He currently divides his time between writing, programming, and coaching. Beck is the author/co-author of Implementation Patterns, Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change 2nd Edition, Contributing to Eclipse, Test-Driven Development: By Example, Planning Extreme Programming, The Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns, and the JUnit Pocket Guide. He received his B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Oregon."
