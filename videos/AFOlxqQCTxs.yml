description: "By, Justin Collins\nLearning to keep your Rails application secure is an often-overlooked part of learning Rails, so let's take a trip through the world of Ruby on Rails security! The journey will start with an overview of security features offered by the popular web framework, then we'll detour through dangerous pitfalls and unsafe defaults, and finally end with suggestions for improving security in Rails itself. As a bonus, we'll talk about how to integrate security into the development process."
