description: "Nick Mathewson,Snake Oil Anonymity: How To Spot It, And How Not To Write It\nMuch software that promises \"anonymity\" fails to deliver, as witnessed by a succession of compromised file-trading networks, back-doored communications systems, overhyped vapornets, and insecure \"improvements\" on existing remailer networks. I\"ll discuss a bunch of allegedly anonymous systems, and explain how a clever attacker can defeat each of them. Audience members will learn to recognize the warning signs of broken anonymity in anonymous communications and P2P; and will learn a few principles to help them design the anonymity properties of their own systems.\n\nNick Mathewson is one of the main designers on Type III (a.k.a. Mixminion), the protocol that will replace the one currently used by the Mixmaster anonymous remail He is also the lead developer of the Mixminion software, and a core developer on the Tor anonymizing proxy. He lives in Cambridge, MA."
