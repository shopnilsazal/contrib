description: "PyData London 2018\n\nThe majourity of big data tools, from Apache Map/Reduce to Apache Spark, and others in between, are built in Java. As Python developers, we want to be able to use these tools, but we face a number of challenges (from awkward APIs to increased overhead). This talk will focus on the work being done to decrease the overhead of working with in Python and how to take advantage of the new improvements. \n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
