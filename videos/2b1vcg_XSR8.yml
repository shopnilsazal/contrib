description: "BY: TORAN BILLUPS\n\nAre you writing software that can survive a rigorous refactor? Would a well written suite of tests make you feel more confident as you iterate? How do you get feedback as you add new features or fix a bug? \n\nJoin me for an intense 25 minute live coding session where I build an ember application from the ground up test-first with nothing but the terminal and my favorite text editor! I'll share some of the tribal knowledge about what makes a great unit or functional test and how you decide to write one over the other.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GO1Q/"
