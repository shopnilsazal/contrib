description: "By Ryan Stenhouse\n\nYou know what? Learning how to speak another language shouldn't be hard. So lets put it in a context that we know and love - programming in Ruby. This is a talk about abstraction, counting, syntax and grammar. It's nerdy, but its fun.\n\nWhat you won't see is your typical \"language talk\" - I won't be banging on about language theory (except to relate to Ruby), or any particular natural language.\n\nI think this is better, because it's about applying what you already know to the task at hand. There might even be a lesson or two snuck in there - wouldn't that be nice?\n\nLearning another language shouldn't be an insurmountable challenge, learning to speak another language even less so. I fully believe, and will explain that by our very nature as programmers, we do this all the time - I'll talk about how these same skills that let us switch from Java to Ruby to Go can be used to help us switch from English to Swedish to Japanese.\n\nHell, it might even help you switch from programming in Ruby to painting landscapes!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4N/"
