description: "Dan Kaminsky - Black Ops of TCP/IP: Work NAT, Work. Good NAT. Woof\nCommunication under TCP/IP networks has become extraordinarily popular; still, there remains significant problems that as of yet have remained unsolved within its layered rules. So, lets break the rules, elegance (and possibly security) be damned. Signficant new techniques and code will be unveiled to answer the following questions:\nA) Instant Portscan\n# Is it possible to discover instantaneously what network services have been made available, even on massive networks?\nB) Guerrila Multicast\n# Is it possible to send a single packet to multiple recipients, using today.s multicast-free Internet?.\nC) \"NATless NAT\"\n# Is it possible to share a globally addressable IP address without translating private IP ranges a la NAT?\n# Is it possible to allow incoming connections to an IP multiplexed in this manner?\nD) NAT Deadlock Resolution\n# Is it possible to establish a TCP connection between two hosts, both behind NATs?\n\nVarious interesting uses of these new packet-level primitives should be discussed, and OpenSSH will trotted out as the method of bringing some degree of security unto the resulting chaos.\n\nDan Kaminsky, also known as Effugas, worked for two years at Cisco Systems designing security infrastructure for large-scale network monitoring systems. He recently wrote the Spoofing and Tunneling chapters for \"Hack Proofing Your Network: Second Edition\", and has delivered presentations at several major industry conferences, including Linuxworld, DefCon, and past Black Hat Briefings. Dan was responsible for the Dynamic Forwarding patch to OpenSSH, integrating the majority of VPN-style functionality into the widely deployed cryptographic toolkit. Finally, he is the founder of the cross-disciplinary DoxPara Research in 1997, seeking to integrate psychological and technological theory to create more effective systems for non-ideal but very real environments in the field. He is based in Silicon Valley, presently studying Operation and Management of Information Systems at Santa Clara University."
