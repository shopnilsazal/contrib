Computers are now both a weapon and a target. Future wars may even be fought over the ownership of IT infrastructure. Therefore, national security thinkers must find a way to incorporate cyber attack and defense into military doctrine as soon as possible. The world's most influential military treatise is Sun Tzu's Art of War. Its wisdom has survived myriad revolutions in technology and human conflict, and future cyber commanders will find Sun Tzu's guidance beneficial. However, this presentation will also consider 10 revolutionary aspects of cyber war that will be difficult to fit into military doctrine.\n\nKenneth Geers (PhD, CISSP) is the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) Cyber Subject Matter Expert. Mr. Geers has been a student in six countries, served as an intelligence analyst, a French and Russian linguist, and a computer programmer in support of arms control initiatives. He was the first U.S. Representative to the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia. Kenneth is widely published on the relationship between information technology and national security, and is the author of Strategic Cyber Security, now a free download: http://ccdcoe.org/278.html.\nTwitter: @kennethgeers\nhttp://www.chiefofstation.com \n\n\n\nStrategic Cyber Security: https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Geers/DEFCON-20-Kenneth-Geers-Strategic-Cyber-Security.pdf"
