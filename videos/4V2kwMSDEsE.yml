description: "RubyConf 2016 - Computer Science: The Good Parts by Jeffrey Cohen\n\nYou don't need a 4-year degree to learn the best parts of computer science. Maybe you've seen jargon like \"Big O Notation,\" \"binary trees\", \"graph theory\", \"map-reduce\", or the \"Turing test\", but have been afraid to ask. But did you know that that these concepts are responsible for Mars rovers, self-driving cars, mobile databases, our air traffic control system, and and even how we elect presidents? In this beginner-focused talk, I will present some simple and very practical ways apply the \"good parts\" of computer science to your next app."
