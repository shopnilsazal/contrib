description: "Nerves + Phoenix Saves a Father's Sanity! by Joel Byler\n\nRecently I've been able to encourage my children to do their chores and not fight about it. Its been made possible with the help of Elixir and an Umbrella project which combines the use of Phoenix and Nerves (and some prototyping hardware) to build a chore system which rewards each kid with their own internet access after they've done their work for the day. It also makes it really easy to revoke access when they misbehave. In this talk I'll take you with me back through the journey, and I'll talk about why it was needed, what I learned, and how the the final outcome has saved my sanity."
