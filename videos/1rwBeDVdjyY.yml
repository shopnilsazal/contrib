The Platform consists of Edge Devices with to import Machine Data from factory floor or building control. The Author lays out the Microservice components (mqtt, prometheus, grafana, cassanda, tensorflow) and the how and why there are stitched together. Following a prototype for feeding Prometheus Data into recurrent neural networks for alarming and load prediction.\n\nAbout Burkhard\n1992 Fernuniversit√§t Hagen Computer Sience 1994 founding teuto.net 2012 start Openstack within teuto.net 2015 Talk: Oenstack SDN principles at Openstack Dach Tag Berlin 2016 Talk: Openstack und Kubernetes at Deutsche Openstack Tage Cologne 2016 start Building Data aquisition Platform n Kubernetes 2017 Talk: Understanding Kubernetes at Cloud Export Frankfurt"
