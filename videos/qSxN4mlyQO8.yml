description: "by Nick Sutterer and J Austin Hughey\n\nTrailblazer introduces several new abstraction layers into Rails. It gives developers structure and architectural guidance and finally answers the question of \"Where do I put this kind of code?\" in Rails. This talk walks you through a realistic development of a Rails application with Trailblazer and discusses every bloody aspect of it."
