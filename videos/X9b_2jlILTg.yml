description: "Genetic engineering - Genetically modifying organisms for fun and profit \nJohan Sosa (@johansosa)\n\nFind out how genetically modified organisms are created. This talk for will focus introducing the basics of DIY genetic engineering for the uninitiated. With the knowledge provided in this talk, you can get started on the path to doing citizen science and maybe even making the next great scientific breakthrough (with a lot dedication, discipline, and focus). Learn how a protein that's part a bacterial immune system can be used to edit an organism genes. Find out how a the equivalent of Denial of Service attacks are used to smuggle DNA into yeast cells. Get info on what equipment is needed to get started in the emerging field of synthetic biology.\n\nBIO: Johan's day job is IT security, but at night he's immersed in science. He has been involved with DIY Biology projects for about two years. With help from many, he leads the lab work for the Real Vegan Cheese project. The Real Vegan Cheese project, which won a Gold medal at the 2014 iGEM competition, aims to produce milk proteins via yeast and thus enable a source of cheese that doesn't require animals."
