description: "Florian Wilhelm - \"It's about time to take your medication!\" or how to write a friendly reminder bot ;-)\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nThe author  shows how to use the [SleekXMPP][1] library in order to\nwrite a small chatbot that connects to Google Hangouts and reminds you\nor someone else to take medication for instance.  The secure and\nrecommended OAuth2  protocol is used to authorize the bot application\nin the [Google Developers Console][2]  in order to access the Google+\nHangouts API. The author will elaborate then on how to use an event-\ndriven library to write a bot that sends scheduled messages, waits for\na proper reply and repeats the question if need be. Thereby, a primer\non event-driven architectures will be given.\n\n[1]: http://sleekxmpp.readthedocs.org/\n[2]: https://console.developers.google.com/"
