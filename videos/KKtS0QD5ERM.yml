description: "RailsConf 2018: Operating Rails in Kubernetes by Kir Shatrov\n\nMoving from operations powered by scripts like Capistrano to containers orchestrated by Kubernetes requires a shift in practices. We'll talk about things beyond \"Getting started with Kubernetes\" guides, and cover such aspects of operations as gradual deployments, capacity planning, job workers and their safety, and how cloud environments like Kubernetes drastically change how we solve them.\n\nThis presentation is about the lessons we learned while migrating hundreds of Rails apps within the organization to Kubernetes."
