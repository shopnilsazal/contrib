description: 'The Federal Trade Commission is a law enforcement agency tasked with protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive practices. Protecting consumers on the Internet and from bad tech is nothing new for the FTC. We will take a look back at what the FTC was doing when DEF CON first began in 1993, and what we''ve been doing since. We will discuss enforcement actions involving modem hijacking, FUD advertising, identity theft, and even introduce you to Dewie the e-Turtle. Looking forward, we will talk about the FTC''s future protecting consumers'' privacy and data security and what you can do to help.'
