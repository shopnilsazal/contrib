title: 'GeeCON 2017: Mark West-Building a Smart Security Camera with Raspberry Pi Zero,Node.js and The Cloud'
recordingDate: 1502694909
description: 'A key advantage of the IoT is that it enables you to expand the potential of constrained devices by giving them access to the computational power of The Cloud. In this session I’ll show you how I transformed a lowly Raspberry Pi Zero webcam into a smart security camera (with motion detection, threat detection and alert notifications) by combining open source software with cloud based image analysis. Attendees can expect an introduction on how to set up their own Raspberry Pi Zero webcam, a comparison of some of the image analysis API’s currently available, and finally a demonstration of how I used Node.js and a range of cloud based API’s (including AWS Rekognition, AWS Lambda and AWS Step Functions) to help my smart security camera distinguish between an unwanted guest and the neighbours cat.'
