title: 'GeeCON Prague 2017: Volker Simonis - Analyzing HotSpot Crashes'
recordingDate: 1516816560
description: 'Abstract: Did you ever found hs_err_pid or replay_pid files in your Java application directory? Did your Java application ever crash and you didn''t know why? This talk will unveil the contents stored by the HotSpot crash handler into the corresponding error files and how this information can be used to analyze and reproduce the crash. It will also introduce tools like the HotSpot Serviceability Agent which helps to introspect native core files and extract the relevant Java information from them which is otherwise not easily accessible by native debuggers. Detailed Plan: - run a Java application which crashes the VM - open the generated hs_err_pid file and explain its different sections: - native and Java stack trace - assembler instructions, register info and mapping to HotSpot data - threads, memory, events, exceptions, etc. - shared libraries, system information - different kind of crashes: - crashes in the runtime - crashes in native code - crashes in compiled (JITed) code - crashes in the GC - crashes during JIT compilation - use the Serviceability Agent to inspect Java/VM data structures in a core file: - what is the SA agent and how does it work - features of the SA agent - run a Java application which crashes during JIT compilation - inspect the generated replay_pid and inline_pid files - replay a crashing JIT compilation - problems when using -XX:ReplayCompiles feature - using the SA agent together with the -XX:ReplayCompiles feature Audience takeaway: The session will help you to better understand the root cause of VM crashes. This knowledge simplifies the task of fixing, working around or reporting the problem. Targeted audience: Experienced Java developers who want to analyze and understand the root cause of Java crashes. Everybody who is interested in HotSpot internals :)'
