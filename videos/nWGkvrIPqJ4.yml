description: "Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Resource Scheduling, But Were Afraid to Ask - Tim Hockin, Google\n\n\"Effective management of shared resources (CPU, memory, etc) is critical to achieving higher utilization and stronger isolation in shared-machine systems like Kubernetes.  As the industry evolves from single-purpose machines toward shared machines running containers, we must begin to internalize and embrace the ideas of resource-based scheduling.  There are several facets of resource management to consider, but it's clear that many people are still asking the wrong questions.\n\nThe truth is that managing resources is HARD.  This talk will try to demystify some of the thinking around this topic, share some techniques for better cluster management, and present some ideas for making Kubernetes an overall more robust system.\"\n\nAbout Tim Hockin\nTim was one of the founding members of the Kubernetes project, and has overseen large parts of the system, including storage and networking. Before Kubernetes, he worked on Google's Borg and Omega systems, and was responsible for most of the node-side functionality. Before that he fiddled with the BIOS, OS, and other low-level software."
