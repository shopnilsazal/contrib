description: "By Jason Clark\n\nOne strength of the Ruby community is the simplicity of sharing code via gems. When a gem is popular enough, it can even develop an ecosystem of additional gems that build on it.\n\nBut extending a gem that wasn't built with that flexibility in mind isn't always easy. This talk highlights tips and techniques for making your gem simpler to plug into, and avoid mistakes that will have devs cursing under their breath.\n\nWe'll cover the highs and lows of interacting with others gems, from configuration to documentation and everywhere in between."
