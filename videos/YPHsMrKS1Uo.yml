description: "by Pedro Gomes\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nRedundancy is the prominent technique for creating resilient, highly availableservices. MySQL has had a quite mature and feature rich replication solutionfor over a decade now. Moreover, there are interesting new features that allowusers to create quite advanced setups. Nowadays, there is group replication,multi-source replication, and of course plain asynchronous replication thatallow users to create interesting new setups.\n\nIn this session we will present recommended ways to mix and match groupreplication with regular asynchronous replication. We will show how the usercan combine both to create simple upgrade/migration paths to complex setups.We will also show specifically on group replication what is the recommendedprocedure to provision and deploy replicas and detail what happens behind thescenes when a replica joins the group.\n\n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 16:35:00"
