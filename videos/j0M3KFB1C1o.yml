description: "Enable your Microservices with Advanced Resiliency and Fault Tolerance Leveraging Istio [I] - Animesh Singh & Tommy Li, IBM\n\nBuilding and packaging microservices is one part of the story. Given a highly salable and distributed microservices deployment is going to face failures at different layers, how do we make these microservices resilient and fault tolerant? How do we enforce policy decisions such as fine-grained access control and rate limits? How do we enabled timeouts/retries, health checks etc? Even though some language specific frameworks address these issues, the implementation is often framework or language specific. \n\nIf the underlying framework or language changes, the resiliency features need to be reimplemented or ported over. And in some cases, applications also have the responsibility of implementing the code and configuration required for resiliency and fault tolerance. A Service-mesh architecture attempts to solve these issues by extracting the common resiliency features needed by a microservice framework away from the applications and frameworks and into the platform itself. Istio provides an easy way to create this service mesh.\n\nIn this talk we will discuss how to build, deploy, connect your Java microservices leveraging Istio service mesh. We then show how to configure and use circuit breakers, timeouts/retries, rate limits and other advanced resiliency features from Istio without changing the application code.\n\nAbout Tommy Li\nTommy Li is a software developer for IBM focusing on Cloud, Container, and Infrastructure technology.
