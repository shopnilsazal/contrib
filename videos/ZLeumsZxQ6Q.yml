description: 'We - software programmers, developers, engineers - tend to have some bias toward new technologies and, in a perfect world, we’d only use them. It’s completely natural for us. We’re enthusiastic about things we do and strive to do them even better. That’s why we should also care about what we do. Thus, I''d like to share the CARE principle (which stands for Communication, Assumptions, Requirements and Expectations) so that we remember we can not only ''KISS'' and ''DRY'' but also ''CARE'' ;)'
