title: 'LA Ruby Conf 2012 Maintainable Ruby on Rails by Steven Baker'
recordingDate: 1334939416
description: "As we enter a decade of applications developed with Ruby on Rails, many teams are starting to feel growing pains relating to design decisions that were made in the past. Development slows down, and morale declines. Fresh competitors without the cruft of legacy code slowing them down easily deliver new features.\n\nThis change of speed is not a natural part of the growth of a software project, but a common symptom of the design decisions made, and techniques practiced, to develop the software in the first place.\n\nIn this talk you will learn how to identify common (and not so common) issues that teams face as their applications age. You will learn about principles of software design, techniques, and practices to solve these problems. You will also gain valuable knowledge about how to make your software more maintainable and extensible to ensure you don't run into these problems in the future."
