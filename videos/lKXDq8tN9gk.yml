description: "Making a Metaverse! A WebVR (not so M)MO for Programmers! By Irvin Hwang \n\nVirtual reality is upon us! After seeing Brian Peiris' AMAZING \"web-based live coding environment for Virtual Reality\" RiftSketch, I was inspired to make my own version. Motivated by questions like 'What if everything in a virtual world was a separate program?', 'What if anyone could look at the code for these programs and create their own within the world?', and 'What if this world was as accessible as opening a window in your browser?', I got to work and using a combination of WebVR, Three.js, and Meteor, I built a prototype I call the Construct Club.\n\nIn this talk I'll describe the programming ideas and tools used to build such a world as well as the potential applications and future directions of the project.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/K6YW/"
