recordingDate: 1466401125
description: "As a key foundation of cloud computing, virtualization technology plays an increasingly significant role, while cloud platforms are also widely and rapidly developing. However, in recent years, we’ve seen an increase in high-risk vulnerabilities in virtualization systems, which could cause some significant challenges to cloud security implementations.\n\nThis talk will introduce Qihoo 360’s Virtualized Security Research Team’s fuzzing framework for virtualization systems and a comprehensive look into the process of 0day vulnerability discovery.\n\nBy using this fuzzing framework we have found 9 0day vulnerabilities in QEMU and 2 0day vulnerabilities in VMware workstation in only 3 months. All these vulnerabilities would help hackers escape from virtual machine and execute arbitrary code.\n\nThe CVE IDs which have been discovered using this fuzzing framework are as follows:\n\nCVE-2015-7504\nCVE-2015-8345\nCVE-2015-5279\nCVE-2015-6855\nCVE-2015-5225\nCVE-2015-6815\nCVE-2015-7549\n\n======\n\nTang Qinghao is the team leader of virtualization security team from Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd , He has rich experience in cloud security area . Additionally, he has found a considerable number of virtualization softwares vulnerabilities."
