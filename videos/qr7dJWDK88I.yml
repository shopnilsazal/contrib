In which direction is MySQL going?\n\nIn this talk, we will look at the plans for GIS in future versions of MySQL,and in MySQL 8.0 in particular. We'll cover the big overarching designdecisions, what it means for the future direction of GIS in MySQL, and how ittranslates into implementation of specific new functionality.\n\nThis talk is both for those that know GIS and would like to know what MySQLcan offer, and for those that know MySQL GIS today and want to know what toexpect in future versions.\n\n\nRoom: H.2214\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 15:00:00"
