description: "A Tale of Two Feature Flags by Rebecca Sliter\n\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Feature flags are a quick win for development teams seeking a way to more rapidly release software but can create unexpected technical complexity.\n\nJoin us for a comparison of the life-cycles of two seemingly similar feature flags. We'll discuss the challenges teams often face when implementing them, as well as strategies to avoid these issues and deliver software quickly and reliably.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H1fh/"
