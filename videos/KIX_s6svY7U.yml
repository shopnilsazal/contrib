description: "Learning About the Brain and Brain-Inspired Learning:\nQuantifying mental states and identifying statistical biomarkers of mental disorders from neuroimaging data is an exciting and rapidly growing research area at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning, with the particular focus on interpretability and reproducibility of learned models. We will discuss promises and limitations of machine-learning methods in such applications, focusing on recent applications of deep learning methods such as recurrent convnets to the analysis of “brain movies” (EEG) data. On the other hand, besides the above “AI to Brain” direction, we will also discuss the “Brain to AI”, namely, borrowing ideas from neuroscience to improve machine learning, with specific focus on adult neurogenesis and online model adaptation in representation learning."
