description: "Come to San Francisco as a Rubyist, leave as a speedcuber. We are going to use Ruby, a video camera, and an insane amount of live demonstration to learn how to solve the Rubik's Cube in less than 20 seconds. You will leave this talk knowing which cube to buy, which of the five most popular solving methods you should be learning, how to practice for speed, where to ask questions, and how Ruby can help teach you to be the fastest speedcuber in town. People are solving the Rubik's Cube quicker today than any time in history and there's a reason why.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8T/"
