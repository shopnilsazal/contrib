description: "Keynote: Build skills through hobbies! Bring them to work! by Liz Fong Jones\n\nBuilding technical and leadership skills doesnâ€™t only happen in the workplace! I became a better technical leader and Site Reliability Engineer from playing games such as Puzzle Pirates, World of Warcraft, EVE Online, and Factorio. I will share what I learned from these experiences, and how both hiring managers and employees can talk about non-traditional forms of experience."
