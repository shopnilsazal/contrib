language: English
recordingDate: 1481160205
description: 'Without mistakes, there is no knowledge. We must make wrong predictions to learn, and we must try the impossible to break out of our complacency. This talk will explore the key role mistakes play in our own minds, our attempts to build AIs, and our practice as programmers. We are going to argue that mistakes are your best friend and offer some guidance on how to make more of them.'
