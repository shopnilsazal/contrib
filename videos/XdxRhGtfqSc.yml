title: 'DEF CON 18 - Dave King - Hardware Hacking for Software Guys'
recordingDate: 1383940550
description: "Dave King - Hardware Hacking for Software Guys\nHardware hacking is cool, but it can be daunting to software guys. Microcontrollers mix hardware and software basically allowing software guys to do hardware in software. Lately several products have emerged that make it even easier for software guys to get hardware up and working. \n\nArduinos are relatively cheap, open source, all-in-one prototyping boards with a strong community behind them. All you need is a USB cable and the Arduino IDE (which is also open source). The Arduino language is easy to learn for anyone with even a basic knowledge of coding. Arduinos can be made into many different security devices including keyboard emulators, RFID readers/writers, combination lock brute forcing robots, magnetic stripe card emulators, and automated cell phone dialers. In a way, an Arduino is kind of like the hardware equivalent of scripting languages. They make development quick and are a good fit for many projects. \n\nIn this talk you'll see examples of projects built with Arduinos and information on how they were done. You'll also see some limitations of Arduinos and some alternatives to typical Arduinos. In the end you'll see that anyone can make really cool hardware, even without a degree in electrical engineering.\n\nDave King likes to break things. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Master's degree in Information Assurance. Dave currently does penetration testing, code review, and spews opinions on how to improve security. In past lives Dave has taught at a local college, contributed to a book on PCI compliance, owned his own PCI approved scanning vendor, and was a web developer and system admin for an eCommerce company. After 10 years working mostly on the software side of hacking, Dave now finds himself spending his free time hacking hardware.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
