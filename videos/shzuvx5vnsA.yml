recordingDate: 1393371598
description: "Kent Radek - Designing an anonymous network\n\nMr. Radek began life as a satellite communications engineer, decided that sucked, and went to work on a computer science degree. After a few years (better not discussed), he began life over as a software engineer with a defense contractor. It took him five years to discover that also sucked, but in the meantime, he designed a pretty cool encryption system for military communications. Recently, he began his third incarnation as a Linux developer, who, in his spare time, decided to combine the best features of Gnutella, Freenet, and Publius in order to make the world a better place for people who enjoy privacy and free speech. His interest s(which are none of your business) include photography, running, cycling, SETI, penguins, and (unfortunately) DVDs. Sites to see: www.puzzlenet.net, www.radek.org, and www.grasshoppertakeover.com. \n\nDEF CON 8.0 was held July 28th - 30th, 2000, in Las Vegas, Nevada USA"
