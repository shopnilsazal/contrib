recordingDate: 1520432855
description: "by Norman Feske\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nGenode recently gained the ability to execute the same binary executables onkernels as different as seL4, NOVA, or Linux. Such kernel-independentexecutables are created via a regular tool chain and executed natively on themachine. The talk explains how it works, presents the challenges that had tobe overcome, and gives an outlook of how Genode will leverage this ability inthe future. The talk will be presented on a laptop running a Genode system andwill be accompanied with live demonstrations.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 13:25:00"
