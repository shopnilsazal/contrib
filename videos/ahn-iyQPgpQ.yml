recordingDate: 1477349050
description: "PyData DC 2016\n\nSo much of data science is about understanding the context around your data. In this talk, we hope to address how to work with messy text data by leveraging fuzzy search algorithms in python or against a database such as PostgreSQL. We will talk specifically about fuzzy algorithms such as Soundex, Trigram/n-gram search, and Levenshtein distances and demonstrate use cases in an ipython notebook."
