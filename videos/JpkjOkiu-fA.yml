description: "Shipping a Solid Rust Crate by Michael Gattozzi\n\nThere's a lot more to releasing a quality crate than just the code. Automating the testing to make sure nothing breaks, checking for test coverage, making sure there are examples, providing documentation are important in making your crate solid and easy to use. Beyond that how do you get people to actually use your crate? You might not know how to increase the visibility of your crate or of small things that can be done to get interest in your crate. This talk covers all of these aspects to help improve the quality of ones crate beyond the code itself."
