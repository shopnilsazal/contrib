language: English
recordingDate: 1400264294
description: "There's no magic mojo that helps a designer notice bad design; there's no secret compendium of design mysteries that developers just don't have access to. Good interaction design is about keeping your senses honed -- noticing the little things and respecting user intuition. In this talk I won't be showing code -- I'll be breaking down the usability of the world around you, and preaching the virtues of interaction awareness. Trust me: you'll never look at a microwave the same way again.\n\nCameron Daigle is a senior designer/consultant/purveyor-of-common-sense at Hashrocket. He works with Ruby and iOS, and has been building for the web since long before that -- but through it all has maintained a deep and steadfast love for beautiful user experiences.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG01/"
