description: "My conclusion after moving a million lines of code is that everything we do (plus or minus) is wrong. Henry Ford said \"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\" Our horses are now a billion times faster: our horses may well be the fastest in the galaxy. Are we too comfortable on our horses? Would we recognize better mounts if they came along, but didn't look like horses? Is the state of our profession one which warrants pride, shame, or despair? I will explore these questions with unwarranted optimism.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG7Z/"
