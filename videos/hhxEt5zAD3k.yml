description: "Our enterprise product has used DRb as a communication layer for a number of years now. With the growth in popularity of EventMachine, it is time for us to evaluate whether a switch is right. This talk will discuss our current DRb setup, our process for comparing DRb and EventMachine and our comparison results, the decision on whether to switch, and either our reasoning to stay with DRb or how the resulting switch to EventMachine was handled.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGfL/"
