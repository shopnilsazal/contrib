description: "Designing with Empathy by Greg Tarnoff\n\nToo often we get caught up in our own biases, even the most compassionate of us. When we do, we lose sight of how to design and build platforms and experiences that work for all our users. We end up building for ourselves, the person who knows the system inside and out, the power user. And while people like us are important, they rarely make up the majority of users.\n\nWe need to build things that anyone can learn quickly, use efficiently, making the user feel confident and powerful. Through examples of atypical users, Iâ€™ll walk through things to consider when designing tools and applications that empower the greatest number of users to achieve more.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HNkS/"
