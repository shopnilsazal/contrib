description: "Say What You Mean: Scaling Machine Learning Algorithms Directly from Source Code: Scaling machine learning applications is hard. Even with powerful systems like Spark, Tensor Flow, and Theano, the code you write has more to do with getting these systems to work at all than it does with your algorithm itself. But it doesn’t have to be this way!\n\nIn this talk, I’ll discuss an alternate approach we’ve taken with Pyfora, an open-source platform for scalable machine learning and data science in Python. I’ll show how it produces efficient, large scale machine learning implementations directly from the source code of single-threaded Python programs. Instead of programming to a complex API, you can simply say what you mean and move on. I’ll show some classes of problem where this approach truly shines, discuss some practical realities of developing the system, and I’ll talk about some future directions for the project."
