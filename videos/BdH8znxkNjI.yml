description: "RailsConf 2017: Distributed & Local: Getting the Best of Both Worlds by Ben Klang\n\nOur company is traditional in many ways, one of which being the need to come into the office each day. Our team of software developers bucks that trend, spreading across 6 states and 4 countries. Dev teams consider themselves \"Remote First\", while DevOps and Application Support are \"Local First.\" Each has adopted tools, habits, and practices to maximize their configuration. Each style has learned valuable lessons from the other. This presentation is about how our teams have evolved: the tools, the compromises, the wins and losses, and how we successfully blend Distributed and Concentrated teams."
