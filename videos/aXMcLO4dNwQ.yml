description: "The Cavalry Is US: Protecting the public good - Josh Corman, Nicholas Percoco\n\nDescription: In the Internet of Things, security issues have grown well beyond our day jobs. Our dependence on software is growing faster than our ability to secure it. In our efforts to find the grown-ups who are paying attention to these risks, one painful truth has become clear: The Cavalry Isn¹t Coming. Our fate falls to us or to no one. At BSidesLV and DEF CON 21, a call was made and many of you have answered. At DerbyCon, we begin the work of shaping our futures. Here at AppSec, we have the opportunity to level-up and reframe our role in all of this. As the initiated, we face a clear and present danger in the criminalization of research, to our liberties, and (with our increased dependence on indefensible IT) even to human safety and human life. What was once our hobby became our profession and (when we weren¹t looking) now permeates every aspect of our personal lives, our families, our safetyŠ Now that security issues are mainstream, security illiteracy has lead to very dangerous precedents as many of us are watching our own demise. It is time for some uncomfortable experimentation.\n\nThis session will both frame the plans to engage in Legislative, Judicial, Professional, and Media (hearts & minds) channels and to organize and initiate our ³constitutional congress² working sessions.  The time is now. It will not be easy, but it is necessary, and we are up for the challenge.\n\n \nIt¹s high time we make our dent in the universe.
