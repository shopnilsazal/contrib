description: "Keynote: Manage the App on Kubernetes - Brandon Philips, CTO, CoreOS\n\nKubernetes has yet to close the developer gap from source code to app running in a production Kubernetes cluster. Many build bespoke tools. How can the Kubernetes community come together to build decomposable solutions that help people define their app, deploy it, and manage its lifecycle over time? Learn about the progress we are making together to elevate the conversation from container orchestration to application lifecycles management.\n\nAbout Brandon Philips\nBrandon Philips is helping to build modern Linux server infrastructure at CoreOS as CTO. Prior to CoreOS, he worked at Rackspace hacking on cloud monitoring and was a Linux kernel developer at SUSE.
