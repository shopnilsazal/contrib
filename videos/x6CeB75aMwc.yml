recordingDate: 1354554634
description: "The simplicity of the Ruby bundled library net/http has produced number of derivation / substitution HTTP clients for Ruby. I, who is an author of a HTTP client, performed surveys of those HTTP clients in last several years. One unsurprising thing I found from it is that users can pick one-gem-for-all generic HTTP client and also can pick the best one for the specified purpose.\n\nIn this talk, based on update to the advantages-and-disadvantages comparison of HTTP clients at http://bit.ly/RubyHTTPClients, I'll introduce characteristics of HTTP clients for different purposes.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGeH/"
