description: 'Einar W. HÃ¸st is an unapologetic ivory tower zealot who programs computers at NRK. His heretic views include thinking before programming and making drawings to understand things better. This arrogant mindset no doubt stems from the years spent in idle isolation while obtaining in a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Oslo.'
