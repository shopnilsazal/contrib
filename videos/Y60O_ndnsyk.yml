description: "Cloud Native Transformation: How Ticketmaster is Changing Culture and Speeding Up Delivery [B] - Bindi Belanger, Ticketmaster\n\nTicketmaster redefined an entire market by being the first to put computers in box offices and we now have four decades worth of products and tools that connect fans with the live events they love. With over 21 ticketing systems across the world and massive global technology team that continues to create and deliver new products and services, we must continually increase our speed to delivery to keep pace with our competitors. Historically, production scale infrastructure required significant lead time and often resulted in product launch delays or painful scaling lessons. As we continue to transition to a completely Cloud Native product offering, we’re now able to deploy infrastructure within a matter of minutes instead of months, thereby allowing our development teams to quickly build and release new products and services. In this talk, we’ll discuss the challenges that we’ve faced along the way and how we’ve made organizational and process changes to help us arrive where we are today.\n\nAbout Bindi Belanger\nBindi Belanger is an Executive Program Director at Ticketmaster, based in Hollywood, California. In her current role, Bindi partners with Technical Operations and Engineering leaders to define strategy for new technology implementations and ensure successful delivery of key programs, including Ticketmaster's Kubernetes project. Prior to Ticketmaster, Bindi served in various project, program and portfolio management roles at several Fortune 500 companies including NBC Universal, UnitedHealth Group and The Walt Disney Company."
