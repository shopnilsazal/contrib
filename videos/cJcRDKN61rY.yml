description: "This topic covers researches made by Critical Infrastructure Defense Team, Kaspersky Lab regarding vast variety of different serious vulnerabilities in popular wanna-be-smart industrial control systems. We found 80+ 0day vulnerabilities and reported to vendors. Some of them are patched already (CVE-2016-5743, CVE-2016-5744, CVE-2016-5874…). However, for most of the bugs it potentially takes more time to fix. \nBugs are good, but what can be better? Yes, backdoors! Let’s take a closer look on the backdoor techniques found in one interesting vendor: they do some stuff for industrial IoT and for general IT technologies (banking, telecommunication providers, crypto solutions etc). The backdoor is not the whole story – we will show how this vendor reacts and fixes critical bugs (SPOILER: silently fixes bug, no CVE assigned, no advisory published, sometimes impossible to patch, 7 month since the report). The most interesting thing is that this technique requires only legitimate software widely used everywhere."
