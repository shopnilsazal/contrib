title: 'AppSec EU 2017 Pushing Left Like A Boss: Application Security Foundations by Tanya Janca'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495791977
description: "With incident response and penetration testing currently receiving most of our application security dollars, it would appear that industry has decided to treat the symptom instead of the disease. 'Pushing left' refers to starting security earlier in the SDLC; addressing the problem throughout the process, and specifically during the development phase. From scanning your code with a vulnerability scanner to red team exercises, developer education programs and bug bounties, this talk will show you how to 'push left', like a boss.\n\nThis talk is aimed at developers, operations, dev-ops, people who are new to application security, managers, or anyone who works in any other field of security than AppSec.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
