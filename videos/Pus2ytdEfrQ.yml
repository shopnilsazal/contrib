In this talk, we'll go deep into Booking.com's case study of introducing service mesh. We will discover the reasons and objectives of the project. Why Envoy was selected as the base rather than other available options. Find out what is the setup and features of the homegrown control plane. We will expand on what service is provided for developers and how they safely deploy potentially dangerous configuration changes. Finally, we will talk about pitfalls met along the way.\n\nAbout Ivan\nSince joining Booking.com in 2013, Ivan has worked on various infrastructure related projects: distributed delivery and processing of telemetry data, Big Data, Web stack, hotel search engine, storage for PII data. Ivan is now tackling questions related to migration toward a service-oriented architecture."
