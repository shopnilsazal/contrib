description: "Typical Puppet users implement this tool in its traditional role of client and master. At Adaptive Computing we build environments for developers all day long using OpenStack, as such the traditional model of client to server for Puppet just didn't fit. For the longest time I thought I was doing it wrong, however Puppet can be implemented without the need of a puppetmaster. The presentation will focus on utilizing puppet in a masterless state allowing the rapid configuration for your environment with no need for the cruft of managing a traditional puppet master. There are pros and cons that will be explored as well as detailed examples of how Adaptive took environment installs from hours of developers time down to about 10 minutes.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2S/"
