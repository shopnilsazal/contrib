description: "OSFeels 2016 - Burnout and the Cult of Busy by Caroline Moore\n\nOur culture glorifies busyness, and perhaps the worst of it can be found in the tech industry. Workers at startups brag about how much they work, and how little they sleep. Engineers forgo lunch for more hours at their desk, social media is riddled with #hustlin and #riseandgrind, and everyone is available at all times. This kind of stress is bad for employees, and bad for business. This talk will cover the importance of self-care, avoiding burnout, and ways to set boundaries to protect your health.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/UkSu/"
