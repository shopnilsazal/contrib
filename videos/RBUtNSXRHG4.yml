description: "Powering Public Infrastructure with Kubernetes [B] - Jan Willies, Accenture\n\nDeutsche Bahn Station & Service has a network of thousands of railway stations in Germany, and each has up to dozens of displays to help traveler information. Managing and distributing information to each one has historically grown into a complex process. In this talk we will dive into how Deutsche Bahn overcomes these obstacles with a modern CI-CD pipeline on top of Kubernetes and their use of containers in production.\n\nAbout Jan Willies\nJan Willies has a background of linux and opensource software where he likes to tinker with embedded systems. Currently he is leading the Kubernetes practice at Accenture."
