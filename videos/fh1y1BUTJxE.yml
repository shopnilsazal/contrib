description: "Title: People who liked this talk also liked ... Building Recommendation Systems Using Ruby\nPresented by: Ryan Weald\n\nFrom Amazon, to Spotify, to thermostats, recommendation systems are everywhere. The ability to provide recommendations for your users is becoming a crucial feature for modern applications. In this talk I'll show you how you can use Ruby to build recommendation systems for your users. You don't need a PhD to build a simple recommendation engine -- all you need is Ruby. Together we'll dive into the dark arts of machine learning and you'll discover that writing a basic recommendation engine is not as hard as you might have imagined. Using Ruby I'll teach you some of the common algorithms used in recommender systems, such as: Collaborative Filtering, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Pearson Correlation Coefficient. At the end of the talk you should be on your way to writing your own basic recommendation system in Ruby.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGc2/"
