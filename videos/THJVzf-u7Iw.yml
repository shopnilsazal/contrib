title: 'AppSec EU 2017 Fixing Mobile AppSec: The OWASP Mobile Project by Bernhard Mueller and Sven Schleier'

recordingDate: 1495791978
description: "Even though modern mobile operating systems like iOS and Android offer great APIs for secure data storage and communication, those APIs have to be used correctly in order to be effective. Data storage, inter-app communication, proper usage of cryptographic APIs and secure network communication are only some of the aspects that require careful consideration.\n\nThe OWASP Mobile Application Verification Standard (MASVS) is an attempt to standardize mobile app security requirements using different verification levels. Complementary to the MASVS, we are developing a Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) that provides detailed test cases for each requirement.\n\nIn this talk, we introduce both the MASVS and MSTG, and discuss the many challenges we faced during development, from dealing with the diversity and fragmentation of the Android ecosystem to clarifying the role of software protections in mobile security.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
