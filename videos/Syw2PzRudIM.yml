description: "Kubernetes Ingress: Your Router, Your Rules - Gerred Dillon, Deis\n\n\"How do we get traffic to our Kubernetes Pods? Reaching for a Service may be our first instinct, but we're walled in by the combination of service types and provider integrations Kubernetes provides. Service resources give little in the way of user control, leaving us to bolt on separate abstractions while hoping the functionality we need is available in the next Kubernetes release. These abstractions can easily become another routing layer that deeply couples to our other resources without any benefits from native integration at the cluster manager level. \n \nWouldn't it be better if we could integrate our applications and traffic in a natural, Kubernetes-native way? The built-in Ingress resource solves common access problems and empowers users to build software for handling custom traffic patterns.\"\n\nAbout Gerred Dillon\nGerred Dillon is a Sr. Solutions Architect with Deis, where he works with customers to implement Kubernetes clusters and develop custom software on them. With a deep background in platform engineering, he is working to expand the Kubernetes tools ecosystem to enable all developers to create robust, resilient systems. Gerred and his family live in sunny Colorado."
