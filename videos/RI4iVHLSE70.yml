title: 'Alexandra Johnson, Best Practices for Hyperparameter Optimization'
recordingDate: 1506017573
description: "Alexandra works on everything from infrastructure to product features to blog posts. Previously, she worked on growth, APIs, and recommender systems at Polyvore (acquired by Yahoo). She majored in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University with a minor in discrete mathematics and logic, and during the summers she A/B tested recommendations at internships with Facebook and Rent the Runway.\n\n\nBest Practices for Hyperparameter Optimization:\nAll machine learning and artificial intelligence pipelines – from reinforcement agents to deep neural nets – have tunable hyperparameters. Optimizing these hyperparameters provides tremendous performance gains, but only if the optimization is done correctly. This presentation will discuss topics including selecting performance criteria, why you should always use cross validation, and choosing between state of the art optimization methods."
