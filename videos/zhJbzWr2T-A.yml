description: "Brian Hurley & Ann Gabriel - Internet Radio Politics: A Tale Of Betrayal And Hope\nInternet Radio Politics: A Tale Of Betrayal And Hope\n\nA summary of the current legal state of internet radio. How the RIAA, a group of popular commercial webcasters, and Congress conspired to betray smaller webcasters, in an attempt to eliminate the majority of stations broadcasting on the internet. We will compare the philosophies of those who see internet radio as just another mass medium to be controlled and consolidated into as few stations as possible, and those who want to maintain a large number of stations with a rich variety of programming, and how these groups are fighting to influence the public, Congress, and the media. We'll close with a look at the future of internet radio, and outline the Webcaster Alliance's strategy to break the RIAA's hold over this new medium.\n\nBrian Hurley runs Detroit Industrial Underground, an internet radio station which plays industrial and electronica genres. DIU has been broadcating since February of 1999. The station features music by independent artists, with an emphasis on Michigan based bands. Hurley has been active in the internet radio community since DIU started brodcasting, and has participated in Castercon 2000, and spoke at Rubi-con 5 on internet radio politics. He is one of most politically active hobbyist webcasters, and has been quoted in several publications on the subject.\n\nHe is an officer in the Detroit Electronica Coalition, and an active member of the Motor City Music Foundation Advisory Board. The MCMF produces the annual Detroit Music Awards.\n\nAnn Gabriel is President of the Webcaster Alliance, and CEO and founder of Gabriel Media, Inc. She has been producing streaming media events since 1998. She has hosted numerous technological and entertainment-related webcasting events including annual events such as CES, COMDEX, Networld+Interop and NAB.\n\nGabriel Media provides complete, end to end webcasting solutions and leads the Industry in the production of live, on-location broadcast events. Gabriel Media also specializes in public relations, marketing and promotional tools and services tailored for the entire webcasting community.\n\nHurley and Gabriel broke the story of how HR 5469 turned from a bill to help the entire webcasting community, into something written by the RIAA to benefit itself and a select few webcasters."
