description: "Go Ahead, Make a Mess by: Sandi Metz\n\nSoftware is always a mess. You can't avoid this mess, and if hubris goads you into attempting to achieve perfection, you'll just make things worse. Perfection is a distant, dim land on the unreachable horizon. You'll not be going there today.\n\nWhat you can do, however, is use the techniques of object-oriented design (OOD) to make your messes manageable. OOD is good at messes. It understands their origins, predicts their courses, and foresees their outcomes. It shines a light down the dusty nooks and crannies of your app, showing you what to do and what to avoid.\n\nThis talk shows you how to use OOD to create the best kinds of messes, those that let you get software out the door today without regretting your actions tomorrow."
