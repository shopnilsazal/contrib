description: "Description\nHow to teach machine learning in a simple yet useful way? Which machine learning ideas can be presented with pen & paper? Which properties of machine learning are in fact properties of any learning, including by us, humans? How to approach various audiences - from programmers, through physicists to people without strong STEM background?\n\nAbstract\nMachine learning (and especially deep learning) is being presented as something hard, requiring years of mathematics and computer science. I don't think it's the case. Many ideas are simple, extension from some common-sense intuitions and can be taught to people from various backgrounds.\n\nI have already shared some things in my blog posts:\n\nking - man + woman is queen; but why?\nLearning Deep Learning with Keras\nWell, it's not my first adventure with trying to teach complex ideas in a simple way, see Quantum mechanics for high-school students and Quantum Game with Photons. Later allows you to play with an actual simulation of a single photon, without need of learning quantum mechanics beforehand.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
