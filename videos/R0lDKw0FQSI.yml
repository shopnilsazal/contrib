In fact we will see the Py_Main function to the ceval.c\nfile of the interpreter.\n\nBut there is no magic in the CPython code, we will travel in the lexer and the\nparser of CPython, and why not, by the AST for one Python expression.\n\nAfter the AST, we will visit the Compiler and the Bytecodes for the\ninterpreter.\nOf course, we will learn there is the peepholer where some basic instructions\nare optimised by the this component.\n\nAnd of course, the interpreter, this virtual machine is really interesting for\nthe newbiew, because it's a big stack where the bytecodes are executed one by\none on the stack and the ceval.c file."
