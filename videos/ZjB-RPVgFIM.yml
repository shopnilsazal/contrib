description: "Containers, microservices, the 12 factor app methodology, unikernels; all of these are examples of a theme in modern development towards both smaller and more self-contained components. These patterns stretch to breaking point the idea that an edge firewall or well-configured application server can address all of your security challenges.\n\nWhat does this mean for application security? How can existing security tools take advantage of these self-contained applications?Most importantly, what security features or functionality can we move from the infrastructure to being part of this new unit of software?\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss:\n\n* The advantages and disadvantages of the application as a black box\n* Ways of asking questions and aggregating information from across your new distributed system\n* Examples of other operational concerns moving from the infrastructure to the application, for instance with metrics and application health information\n* The importance of relating build-time and runtime data to fully understand the state of your system\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
