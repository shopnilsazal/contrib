description: "Breaking Bacchante: The Trials And Responsibilities of Making Something New, Great, and Lasting by Andy Ihnatko\n\nIn 1897, “Bacchante” was ignominiously driven out of its intended home at the new Boston Public Library, due to pressure from puritanical groups that considered it indecent, inappropriate, and a corrupting influence.\n\nHow on earth did this happen? And what can “Bacchante”’s experience teach us, as people who make things and then send them out into the world?\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FT8Z/"
