description: 'If you take a look at software today, you''ll see more smart people building things than there ever have been before. The problem? They''re all working in different languages, on different platforms, with different concepts. To take advantage of the full breadth of work that''s being done, we need to stay on top of things happening in other communities, and we need to bring good ideas back to Ruby. In this session, we''ll look at how to identify great code and concepts, and how to bring them back to our community.'
