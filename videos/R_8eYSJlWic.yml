recordingDate: 1378229720
description: "Speaker: Roel Verdult, Radboud University Nijmegen\nAuthors: Roel Verdult, Radboud University Nijmegen; Flavio D. Garcia, University of Birmingham; Baris Ege, Radboud University Nijmegen\nPresented at the 22nd USENIX Security Symposium\n\nDue to a recent injuction by the High Court of London this talk cannot cover the technical core of the accepted paper. Instead, it will describe the background and context of the work we did on vehicle immobilizer systems. It puts our study in a broader spectrum of related work that is available in the academic literature. Furthermore, it mentions several alternative immobilizer systems that were introduced years ago by academia and industry which use openly designed and well-studied encryption algorithms like the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)."
