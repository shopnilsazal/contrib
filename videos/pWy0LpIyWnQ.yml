description: "DevOpsDays Chicago 2017 - Ignites- Containers, Virtual Machines, and Bare Metal - Oh My! Mixed Infrastructure Applications by Nell Shamrell-Harrington\n\nIn a world of buzzwords and trends it is easy to believe that a type of infrastructure is now dead or that a new type is the future. Beyond those with clairvoyance, no one can say with certainty what the future of infrastructure will bring. What we can know is that in todayâ€™s reality many applications must run on mixed infrastructure - bare metal for static compute heavy loads, virtual machines for persistent data stores, and ephemeral short lived containers for stateless portions of the application. Come to this talk to learn how to determine what parts of an application go on what type of infrastructure and how to coordinate the different types into a coherent and powerful experience."
