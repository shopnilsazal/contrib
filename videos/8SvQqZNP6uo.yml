description: "Keynote: Kubernetes - Kelsey Hightower, Staff Developer Advocate, Google\n\nAfter almost 2 years in production it helps to remind ourselves what Kubernetes is. At it's core Kubernetes is a set of small, well defined, components connected by an unified API. On the surface, Kubernetes is an application management platform, but if you dig a little deeper you'll discover that Kubernetes is a framework for building distributed systems. During this session attendees will go below the surface and gain an understanding of the Kubernetes core and learn how to leverage it to solve common infrastructure challenges in new and innovated ways."
