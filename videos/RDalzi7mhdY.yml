title: 'Understanding parser combinators: a deep dive - Scott Wlaschin'
recordingDate: 1470647078
description: "Traditionally, writing parsers has been hard, involving arcane tools like Lex and Yacc.An alternative approach is to write a parser in your favourite programming language, using a \"parser combinator\" library and concepts no more complicated than regular expressions. In this talk, we'll do a deep dive into parser combinators.\nWe'll build a parser combinator library from scratch in F# using functional programming techniques, and then use it to implement a full featured JSON parser."
