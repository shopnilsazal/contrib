description: "Do you know what is inside of your class files? Are you ready to bet? Let's have fun by diving into bytecode pattern matching and explore how different Java compilers and their versions transform your source code.\n\nOur dive will be based on details of implementation of most popular open-source code coverage tool for Java - JaCoCo. Whose recently released version finds in bytecode and filters out various compiler generated artifacts, which otherwise require unnecessary and sometimes impossible tricks to not have partial or missing code coverage."
