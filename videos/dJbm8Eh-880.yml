description: "The Dirty South -- Getting Justified with Technology\nDAVID KENNEDY FOUNDER & PRINCIPAL SECURITY CONSULTANT, TRUSTEDSEC\nNICK HITCHCOCK SENIOR SECURITY CONSULTANT, TRUSTEDSEC\n\nIt seems that every day there's a new NextGen firewall, whitelisting and blacklisting, DLP, or the latest technology thats suppose to stop us. But does it really stop \"hackers\"? Truth is, naw not really. In this talk we'll be showing off the latest bypass techniques for the \"latest\" hacker stoppers, using a universally whitelisted website as our middle man for a command and control, social engineering our way into some of the toughest companies, and showing off some techniques that work for us. This talk is about throwing misconceptions of protection and safety out the window, and going back the dirty south. Where thinking outside of the box is a requirement. We'll be releasing two new tools, one that makes meterpreter invisible over the network, and the other a shell that uses a popular third party as the command and control. A vulnerability scanner won't help you herrrrrrre. \n\nDavid Kennedy (@dave_rel1k) is founder and principal security consultant of TrustedSec - An information security consulting firm located in Cleveland Ohio.
