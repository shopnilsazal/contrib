description: "Elephants on Automatic: HA Clustered PostgreSQL with Helm [I] - Josh Berkus, Red Hat & Oleksii Kliukin, Zalando\n\nKuberntes and Helm are not only the best way to automate high-availability PostgreSQL clusters, they're also the easiest! Join us to find out how you can deploy several different PostgreSQL cluster types using Helm in 30 minutes or less.\n\nHelm is a package manager of choice for the Kubernetes community. PostgreSQL is the most advanced open-source database and is quickly becoming the relational database of choice for numerous developers running their applications in the cloud. In this talk, we are going to show two different types of fully automated PostgreSQL clusters with Helm: Spilo and CitusDB. Spilo provides automated failover and support services for single-master database clusters, and CitusDB provides sharded, big-data PostgreSQL.\n\nWe will demonstrate both of these types of clusters (and possibly others), explain how the Helm charts which set them up work, and how you can modify them to support your production environment.\n\nAbout Josh Berkus\nJosh Berkus containerized and automates all the things, using Project Atomic, Kubernetes, Ansible and Python. He's also known for his work on the PostgreSQL database.\n\nAbout Oleksii Kliukin\nOleksii Kliukin is an engineer for Zalando, where he helps improve and maintain Spilo and Patroni, providing the fashion giant with full-automated, self-deploying database clusters."
