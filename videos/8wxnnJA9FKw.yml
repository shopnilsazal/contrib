description: "Give your Data the Respect it Deserves by Jason Dobry\n\nYour data is one of your most valuable assets, and it deserves your respect.

Forget fleets of boilerplate services and dissatisfactory (read buggy) data management, JSData supercharges your RESTful (and not so RESTful) data and makes handling it a breeze. Primed to grant any JavaScript app wisdom beyond its youth, JSData employs various adapters to talk to HTTP, localStorage, Firebase and . An in-memory store gives you a slick interface for interacting with your data, regardless of where it came from or where it's going. Switch frameworks while leaving your data layer intact! For ages 3 and up and those who above all else, desire power (over their data).\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GV7D/"
