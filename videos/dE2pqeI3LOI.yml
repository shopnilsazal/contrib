title: 'GoGaRuCo 2014- Sketchnoting: Creative Notes for Technical Content'
recordingDate: 1412361698
description: "By, Jessica Eldredge\nAs developers, most of our time is spent on computers and electronic devices; but sometimes good old-fashioned pen and paper is the best way to explore and develop our ideas. Sketchnoting combines hand-drawn elements and text to enhance focus, improve memory, and visualize important concepts. The practice of sketchnoting is not about the ability to drawâ€”it's about the ability to listen.\n\nThis talk will cover tools and techniques to visually capture ideas, how to approach the mental multitasking required to sketch during technical talks and meetings, and why \"I can not draw\" is just a mental barrier to embracing creativity in your notes.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FUGO/"
