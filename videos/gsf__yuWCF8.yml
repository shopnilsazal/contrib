description: "Switching From External Load Balancing to consul & ingress [I] - Dan Wilson, Concur\n\nAt Concur we integrated our kubernetes clusters to our own internal F5 ecosystem which worked well for internal data center deployments but turned out to be cumbersome when trying to maintain a consistent setup for our cloud environments. We'll discuss what the issues are that we faced and the new architecture that we're using which combines consul for dns service discovery with kubernetes ingress in a multi kubernetes cluster design.\n\nAbout Dan Wilson\nI have a passion for collaborating across the business and using data to drive decision making. My primary areas of focus include container orchestration, developer pipeline, cloud service architecture, scale out technologies, design for failure and open source technologies."
