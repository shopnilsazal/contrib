description: "Everyone has *heard* about SOA. If you've come from Java, you were probably forced to do SOA at a past job. But what does it mean to actually do SOA in Rails apps? What does it afford? What are some common patterns and implementations? And most of all, what works and what doesn't?\n\nAt Goldstar, our small team has been slowly breaking up our monolithic Rails and Perl legacy application into small apps that handle just one part of our business at a time. We love it. Our small apps are self contained, have crazy fast test suites (without parlor tricks) and it's made our mean time to delivery faster than ever. I'll tell you what has worked, what hasn't, and some patterns that have made the job easier."
