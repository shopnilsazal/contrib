recordingDate: 1392702011
description: "Nothingface, Automotive Networks\nAutomotive Networks\n\nThis presentation provides an introduction to the electronic networks present on late model automobiles. These networks will be described loosely following the OSI model of networking. Common uses of these networks will be presented, and the privacy implications of some uses will be questioned. The presentation will conclude with an introduction to OpenOtto, a free software and hardware project implementing the network protocols previously described.\n\nNothingface is formally educated in electrical and computer engineering and informally (i.e., not) educated in automotive maintenance and repair. He has been known to earn his keep doing software design, hardware design, and security consulting. Nothingface is currently employed designing hardware and software for two-way radio communication networks."
