description: "The independent game scene has changed dramatically over the last several years. New platforms have arisen, while some mainstay sales avenues have drastically evolved. It's now easier than ever to self-publish a game on a variety of platforms - but it's also arguably more difficult to get players to actually pick your game out from the crowd too. Talking at GDC 2015, ex-Gamasutra editor & current Tinybuild staffer Mike Rose discusses the state of indie sales.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
