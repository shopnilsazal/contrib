description: "30k Feet Look at WiFi\nLuiz \"effffn\" Eduardo\n\nAlthough inflight wee-fee service is really nothing new... (some airlines have had it for a while, some even already gave-up on the service), in the past year it's got some traction again with the release of the service by some airlines in the US and some other countries. The talk will cover things like wi-fi infrastructure, auth stuff, spectrum analysis, protection mechanisms (if any), general usage, user device types and uplink technology that actually makes the user hit the \"tubes\". Data collected a few years ago in flights using older technologies, as well as data collected in newer ones and the possible use of tools available will be discussed.\n\nLuiz \"effffn\" Eduardo has been working with infosec for a while, mostly dedicated to wireless security, protocol fuzzing and computer incident response in the past few years. He is somewhat known in the scene for planning, implementing and supporting wireless networks in some of your favorite hacker conferences. He's one of DefCon networking team goons and has spoken previously at Shmoocon, DefCon, Toorcon, Hack in the Box Malaysia and other cons. Luiz currently holds the following certifications: CISSP, CWNE, CEH, GCIH and GISP, and has probably being able to get them due to long flights around the globe and flight delays in airports. LE is one of the organizers of the Brazilian infosec conference \"you sh0t the sheriff\".\n\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
