description: "Minitest 6: test feistier! by Ryan Davis\n\nMinitest 5 ships with ruby and is the standard test framework for rails. It already provides a traditional unit test framework, spec DSL, mocks, stubs, test randomization, parallelization, machine agnostic benchmarking, and tons of assertions all in under 2kloc. So what would Minitest 6 do differently? Hopefully to the end user, not much will change, and yet it will be worlds apart from Minitest 5. Come see how you can massively speed up your rails test runs and improve your testing practices by upgrading your test framework."
