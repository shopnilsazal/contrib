description: 'We''ve built a $200 open source robot that cracks combination safes using a mixture of measuring techniques and set testing to reduce crack times to under an hour. By using a motor with a high count encoder we can take measurements of the internal bits of a combination safe while it remains closed. These measurements expose one of the digits of the combination needed to open a standard fire safe. Additionally, ''set testing'' is a new method we created to decrease the time between combination attempts. With some 3D printing, Arduino, and some strong magnets we can crack almost any fire safe. Come checkout the live cracking demo during the talk!'
