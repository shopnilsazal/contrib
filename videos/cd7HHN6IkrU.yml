title: 'jQuery Conference 2013 SF Beyond the DOM: Sane Structure for JS Apps by Rebecca Murphey'
recordingDate: 1345526235
description: "This presentation was recorded at the jQuery Conference 2012 held in San Francisco on June 29 thru June 30, 2012.\n\nIn the bad old days of JavaScript, our days were spent fighting through a thicket of DOM differences. These days, we've pretty much conquered those challenges thanks to tools such as jQuery, but our new challenge is figuring out how to adapt as more and more of our application logic moves from the server to the client. We have great tools like Backbone, Ember, Knockout, and more, but in order to use them effectively, we need to do more than learn their APIs -- we need to learn to think about our code beyond the DOM-centric ways of the past. In this talk, I'll look at useful patterns for thinking about client-side application development that will help you avoid creating a tangled mess of code."
