description: "datagram - Introduction to Tamper Evident Devices\n\nTamper evident technologies are quickly becoming an interesting topic for hackers around the world. DEF CON 18 (2010) held the first ever \"Tamper Evident\" contest, where contestants were given a box sealed with a variety of tamper evident devices, many of which purport to be \"tamper proof.\" All of these devices were defeated, even by those with little experience and a limited toolkit. Like the computer world, many of these devices are overmarketed and it is difficult for the average person to compare different tamper evident technologies.\n\nThis talk covers the design and uses of tamper evident devices used in the commercial and government sectors. We'll dig into the nitty gritty of how many of these devices work, the methods by which they can be defeated, and live demonstrations of defeats against common tamper evident devices. Be advised: this talk is for only the stealthiest of ninjas; pirates need not apply.\n\ndatagram has taught about locks, safes, and methods to compromise them for many years, including training to private companies and government agencies. He has spoken many times on physical and digital security at various conferences and is a part-time forensic locksmith. datagram runs the popular lock and security websites lockwiki.com and lockpickingforensics.com. datagram is the leader of \"The Motherfucking Professionals,\" the team that won the first Tamper Evident contest at DEF CON 18."
