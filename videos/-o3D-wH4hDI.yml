title: 'GeeCON 2017: Piotr Przyby≈Ç - Graylog: one tool to log ''em all'
recordingDate: 1502694960
description: 'There are 10 kinds of people: the ones who already log stuff and the ones who will. ;-) But what can be fascinating about logging? It''s just adding some statements of given level to a file in /var/log, so what''s this presentation for in the fist place? Well, ordinary adding lines to /var/log and tracing them with tail -f or searching with grep is so... 1980 and inefficient. Meet Graylog: a centralised and distributed log management system. A tool, which will let you gather, process, analyse logs from many sources: syslog, your application, Apache/ngix, database, firewall, etc. It can alert, search all ways throug, analyse the logs no matter what language/technology sent them. And it makes that good. And is Open Source. This presentation is about some gotchas based on real-life experience, quick Graylog setup, wiring your apps/systems/servers, analysing logs after. Even if the machine which sent them is already gone.'
