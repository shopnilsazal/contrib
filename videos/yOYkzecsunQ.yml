description: '''It''s just a detail.'' Have you ever said that or been told that? Whether it''s about implementation or requirements, we often use the word detail to suggest that something is not important enough to worry about. There are so many things to worry about in software development that we need to prioritise â€” too much detail, not enough focus. The problem is that in software, the details matter because that is what software is: lots of details brought together in combination. If we don''t focus on the details, we get debt, defects and delays.'
