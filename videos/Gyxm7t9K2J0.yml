description: "by Shih-Ching Yang (imacat)\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nAs a hardcore OpenOffice and game player/hacker, I always keep detailed gamerecords with Calc spreadsheets, including characters, stats, resources, eventplans, etc., so that I can get the best of it. When it comes to Pokémon GO, Ikeep the Pokémon individual values (IV), maximum combat powers (CP), and otherinformation that calculated from 3rd-party websites on my spreadsheets, inorder to plan which Pokémon to spent precious resources to power up. Thespreadsheet document eventually becomes an application that works completelyoff-line.\n\nYou can always do everything with OpenOffice, for fun!\n\n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 09:30:00"
