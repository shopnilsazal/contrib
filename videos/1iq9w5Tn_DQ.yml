recordingDate: 1392701706
description: "Sarah Gordon,What Do You Mean, Privacy?\nPrivacy doesnt mean the same thing to everyone... Since you\"re interacting in a global space, you need to understand what people outside your immediate frame of reference are thinking when they talk about privacy because what they think will influence ttheir expectations and their actions. This talk will give you the opportunity to examine some other views of privacy, explore your own thinking, and compare it with others both from the global information security community and the audience. Finally, we\"ll look at how well those thoughts match up with behaviors related to various aspects of what we call \"privacy\".\n\nSarah Gordon has spoken at DEFCON on topics from the security of PGP, women of #hack, and the impact of legislation on virus writing, and done lots of security related stuff for lots of different groups."
