description: "by Dominik George and Eike Jesinghaus\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nWhen the Ingress game started in 2013, quite a few people world-wide found outthat augmented reality gaming in the real world was a great new invention, andthe game grew to become a success for the then-project inside Google. With itsPokémon themed update in 2016, Niantic got the whole world playing - andsponsoring them with all their personal details. Veripeditus opens up theworld of AR game creation to the public.\n\nThe Pokémon Go hype is spreading and more and more people are playing - on areal map with real objects. With the ever growing possibilities of smartphones and apps, interest for Augmented Reality is getting bigger. But thereare obvious problems: current developers don't care about privacy and data iscollected, sold and freely provided to others at will.\n\nAbout time to make a change! Veripeditus is entirely free, open sourcesoftware and easy to use. The server can be run entirely by yourself andeveryone can develope games and custom clients if they wish. The frameworkdallows for the development of augmented reality games, so called \"cartridges\",that can be played in the real world in any scope, be it locally, like on thepremises of a museum, or on global scope, like an augemented reality MMORPG.\n\nIn the development of Veripeditus, we aim at making game development as easyas possible. The only thing needed is basic knowledge of Python and, ofcourse, ideas for the game. Veripeditus itself also employs basic, well-knowntechnologies like a relational database, the SQLAlchemy object-relationalmapper and a (glorified) RESTful API.\n\nThis talk will give an introduction to how Veripeditus was developed, howgames can be created and what can be done with it - some ideas include usingVeripeditus in education, local group activities, tourism amd, of course,plain fun gaming.\n\nWe will also showcase a mini game that will be playable on the ULB campus!\n\n\nRoom: K.1.105 (La Fontaine)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 10:00:00"
