With many 3rd party plugins available, it can be difficult to determine which, if any, are the best match for your system. Angela and Usha will highlight their journey through the CNI ecosystem from adding support for CNI in Cloud Foundry to building “Silk” - their very own CNI plugin. Attendees will gain insight into the process of both deciding to and building a CNI plugin and considerations that must be made about how to integrate the plugin with existing platform concerns about networking and security.\n\nAbout Usha\nUsha is a Staff Product Manager at Pivotal and the Product Lead for CF Networking.
