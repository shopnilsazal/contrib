description: "We designers have been told for ages to learn how to program because we needed to know the technology. On the other hand, very few developers bother doing the same with design. This usually leads to worse results than necessary, and robs us of the opportunity to play on the same team. This presentation is meant to contribute to the much needed discussion about how developers and designers can work together to achieve excellence without losing their minds. Attendees should leave the room afterwards with a certain insight in how ignorance hinders best outcomes and how they personally can improve the situation.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H497/"
