description: "Panel â€” Surveillance on the Silver Screen- Fact or Fiction? \nNicole Ozer Technology and Civil Liberties Policy Director, ACLU of California \nKevin Bankston Policy Director, New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute \nTimothy Edgar Fellow, Watson Institute for International Studies, Brown University\n\nJoin ACLU and others for a fun-filled surveillance tour of the movies - from Brazil to Bourne - to talk about what is still fiction and what is now fact. What is technologically possible? What is legal? And what is happening in the courts, Congress, and in companies and communities to reset the balance between government surveillance and individual liberties.\n\nKevin Bankston is the Policy Director of the New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute, where he works in the public interest to promote policy and regulatory reforms to strengthen communities by supporting open communications networks, platforms, and technologies, with a focus on issues of Internet surveillance and censorship. Prior to leading OTI's policy team, Kevin was a Senior Counsel and the Director of the Free Expression Project at the Center for Democracy & Technology. From that position, he spent two years advocating on a wide range of Internet and technology policy issues both international and domestic, most recently organizing a broad coalition of companies and civil society organizations to demand greater transparency around the US government's surveillance practices. Prior to joining CDT, he worked for nearly a decade at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, specializing in free speech and privacy law with a focus on government surveillance, Internet privacy, and location privacy. As a Senior Staff Attorney at EFF, he regularly litigated issues surrounding free expression and electronic surveillance, and was a lead counsel in EFF's lawsuits against the National Security Agency and AT&T, challenging the legality of the NSA warrantless wiretapping program first revealed in 2005. He received his JD at the University of Southern California Law School after receiving his BA at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nTimothy H. Edgar is a visiting fellow at the Institute and adjunct professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center. His work focuses on the unique policy challenges posed by growing global cyber conflict, particularly in reconciling security interests with fundamental values, including privacy and Internet freedom. Mr. Edgar served under President Obama as the first director of privacy and civil liberties for the White House National Security Staff, focusing on cybersecurity, open government, and data privacy initiatives. From 2006 to 2009, he was the first deputy for civil liberties for the director of national intelligence, reviewing new surveillance authorities, the terrorist watchlist, and other sensitive programs. He has also been counsel for the information sharing environment, which facilitates the secure sharing of terrorism-related information. He has a JD from Harvard Law School, where he served on the Harvard Law Review, and an AB from Dartmouth College.\n\nNicole Ozer developed and has led the technology and civil liberties work for the ACLU in California since 2004. Nicole is a nationally recognized expert on issues at the intersection of consumer privacy and government surveillance and free speech and the Internet. Nicole developed Demand Your dotRights, ACLU's national online privacy campaign and spearheaded the passage of both the first RFID and digital book privacy laws in the nation. Nicole is the author of numerous legal and policy publications, including Losing the Spotlight: A Study of California's Shine the Light Law, Privacy & Free Speech: It's Good for Business, a primer of dozens of case studies and tips for baking safeguards into the business development process. Her most recent law review article, Putting Online Privacy Above the Fold: Building a Social Movement and Creating Corporate Change, was published by the NYU Review Law & Social Change in 2012. Nicole graduated magna cum laude from Amherst College, studied comparative civil rights history at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, and earned her J.D. with a Certificate in Law and Technology from Boalt Hall School of Law, University of California Berkeley.
