description: "A cry for help: What Answering 911 Teaches Us About Building Better Software byTaylor Dewey\n\n\"911, what is your emergency?\" is the question that starts every call. My job, for three years, was to negotiate the caller's emotional minefield to gain life-saving information and insight.\n\nIn this story-centric talk, I show how working in software and with open source communities is similar to emergency services.\n\nParticipants will hear stories that reveal human nature and understand some of the system and training that creates order from emotional chaos. UX designers and software developers can use these same techniques to uncover their users' needs, manage volunteers, communicate effectively, and prioritize development.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HOB1/"
