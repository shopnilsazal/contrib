description: "A Non-Traditional Tech Degree by Michael Westbrooks II\n\nIn this talk, I will explore an alternative route to entering the technology industry without having a traditional degree in computer science. I would like to connect with the listeners that have an interest in pursuing technology, but have fears of doing so due to having a degree in a completely different field. My goal is to utilize my experiences, build awareness around various resources, either known or unknown, and motivate those same listeners to take the chance and pursue their newfound interests. At the conclusion of the talk it would be ideal to have created a community to embark on this journey together; I am still growing and developing."
