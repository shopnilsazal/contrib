description: 'Front-end development has an amazing assortment of libraries and tools, yet it can seem very complex and doest seem much fun. So we''ll live code a ClojureScript application (with a bit of help from Git) and show how development doesn''t have to be complex or slow. Through live evaluation, we can build a reactive, functional application. Why not take a look at a well designed language that uses modern functional & reactive concepts for building Front-End apps. You are going to have to trans-pile anyway, so why not use a language, libraries and tooling that is bursting with fun to use.'
