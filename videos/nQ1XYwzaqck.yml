recordingDate: 1354390767
description: "More than any other feature of the language, in my opinion blocks are what make using Ruby fun. But what is a block, exactly? What would I see if I could cut one open and look inside? During this talk we'll:\n\nExplore Ruby's internal implementation of blocks, lambdas, procs and bindings. Learn how closures and metaprogramming are related in Ruby internals. Discover what metaclasses and singleton classes are and how Ruby uses them. Do you really need to know how Ruby works internally to be a good Ruby developer? Probably not. But taking a peek under the hood can help you better understand the language... and is a lot of fun!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGeC/"
