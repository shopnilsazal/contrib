description: "Cloud Native, Event Drive, Serverless, Microservices Framework - OpenWhisk\n\nCloud computing has been a game changer in a number ways and the emergence of serverless computing/architectures is just another example of what cloud tech has been able to achieve. Serverless is about abstracting users away from servers, infrastructure, and having to deal with low-level configuration or the core operating system. Instead, developers make use of single purpose services and elastic compute platforms to execute code.\n\nIn this talk we are going to discuss open source serverless platform OpenWhisk. OpenWhisk provides a distributed compute service to execute application logic in response to events. There are several key architectural concepts: \nTriggers: A class of events emitted by event sources.\nActions: Encapsulate the actual code to be executed which support multiple language bindings including\nDocker Containers Rules: An association between a trigger and an action.\nIn this talk we are going to discuss the rise of Serverless architecture to compose solutions using modern abstraction and chaining."
