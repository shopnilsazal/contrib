title: 'Karolina Alexiou - Mall Analytics Using Telco Data & Pandas'
recordingDate: 1406376615
description: "PyData Berlin 2014 \nThis talk will be about my latest project in mall analytics, where we estimated visitor trends in malls around the globe using telco data as a basis, and employed map reduce technologies and data science to extrapolate from this basis to reality and correct for biases. We succeeded in extracting valuable information such as count of visitors per hour, demographics breakdown, competitor analysis and popularity of the mall among different parts of the surrounding areas, all the while preserving user privacy and working only with aggregated data. I will show an overview of our system's modules, how we got a first raw estimation of the visitors and their behaviours, and how we refined and evaluated this estimation using pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and other python libraries."
