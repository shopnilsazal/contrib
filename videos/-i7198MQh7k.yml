description: "Graphs are ubiquitous data structures, and the algorithms for analyzing them are fascinating. Loom is an open-source Clojure library that provides many graph algorithms and visualizations. We will discuss how graphs are represented in a functional world, bridge the gap between procedural description of algorithms and their functional implementation, and learn about the way Loom integrates with other graph representations.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HdDB/"
