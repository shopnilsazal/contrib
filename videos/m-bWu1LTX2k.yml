title: 'DEF CON 7- Dr. Byte- IPv6: Who/What/When/Where/How/Why.'
recordingDate: 1393405954
description: "Dr. Byte- IPv6: Who/What/When/Where/How/Why.\nThe Internet Protocol has undergone substantial changes in past few years from version 4 (Classical IP) to version 6 (Next Generation IP). This presentation will overview who's using the new protocol, what the new protocol's features are, when it will become mainstream, where it's being deployed, how the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is planned, and why we need a new fundamental protocol on the Internet. This speech will contain many technical details and will assume the knowledge of the basics of TCP/IP.\n\nDr. Byte is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering and an instructor of Computer Engineering at a major university. He received his B.S. and M.S. in Computer Engineering in 1994 and 1997 respectively. For his M.S., he worked with a real time bit error rate simulator, and developed a next generation real time hardware system for bit error rate simulations. He has developed a 16 bit RISC microprocessor in VHDL in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) able to run compiled 'C' code. His research interests include developing a taxonomy of attacks and applying it to different network environments. He has co-authored 3 papers on IEEE 802.11 and IPv6. \n\nDEF CON 7.0 was held July 9-11th, 1999, in Las Vegas Nevada USA"
