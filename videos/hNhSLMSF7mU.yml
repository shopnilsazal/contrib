It's not about cross-platform apps.\n\nIt's not about that having web developers building apps.\n\nReact Native is a game changer for every Android Developer. Remember those shitty webviews your manager wants to keep? ReactNative is there to kill that and make your app more flexible keeping a native look and feel (yes it's React Native).\n\nCome to understand why it's a big deal to understand React Native for an Android Developer (and a few hints about how to catch the train while it's not too late!)\n\nType: Android development\nExperience: beginner\n\nAlex Karp Production"
