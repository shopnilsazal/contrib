description: "Robots: You're Doing It Wrong 2\nKaty Levinson Director of Development, Hacker Dojo\n\nBy popular demand, Defcon's angry little roboticist is back with more stories of robot designs gone awry that make practical lessons on making better robots. Drinking will happen: vodka-absconding scoundrels are not invited.\n\nThis talk will cover material assuming the average audience member is a relatively intelligent coder with a high-school physics/math background and has seen linear algebra/calculus before. The intent is to navigate people new to robotics around many lessons my teams and I learned the \"hard way,\" and to introduce enough vocabulary for a self-teaching student to bridge the gap between amateur and novice professional robotics. It will not cover why your Arduino doesn't work when you plugged your USB tx into your RS232 tx.\n\nKaty Levinson is a jack-of-all-trades currently employed by Hacker Dojo, a hackerspace in Mountain View California, where she herds cats and wrings them out for money. She was previously a roboticist and the Software Team Lead at NASA Ames on the Lunar Micro Rover Project, and has also been an infrastructure software engineer at Google. She briefly worked as a mercenary for a small VC firm and in Hong Kong where she refereed political pissing matches. She survived 4 seasons of FIRST Robotics as a team member, mentored an additional team, helped found five more and mentored them each through a full competitive season. She has won many prestigious awards which you have neither heard of nor care about and is a proud graduate of Worcester Polytechnic Institute.\nTwitter: @katylevinson"
