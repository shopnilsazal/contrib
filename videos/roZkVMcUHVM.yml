title: 'The Return of Shoes by Steve Klabnik'
recordingDate: 1323221505
description: 'It''s been two years since _why the lucky stiff has departed Ruby. His work, however, carries on. Shoes was one of _why''s most ambitious projects, and a tiny but scrappy team has kept Shoes alive. If you haven''t heard of Shoes, it''s a GUI toolkit for Ruby. Most of these are simply bindings to toolkits written in other languages, like QT or Tk. Shoes is native to Ruby, so it uses Ruby-only features heavily, such as blocks. Shoes also includes packaging functionality that allows you to distribute your apps on Linux, OSX, and Windows. In this talk, Steve will cover the basics of building applications with Shoes, the challenges of maintaining a large polyglot project with an absent inventor, and what''s in store for the future of Shoes.'
