description: "RailsConf 2017: Practical Debugging by Kevin Deisz\n\nPeople give ruby a bad reputation for speed, efficiency, weak typing, etc. But one of the biggest benefits of an interpreted language is the ability to debug and introspect quickly without compilation. Oftentimes developers reach for heavy-handed libraries to debug their application when they could just as easily get the information they need by using tools they already have.\n\nIn this talk you will learn practical techniques to make debugging easier. You will see how simple techniques from the ruby standard library can greatly increase your ability to keep your codebase clean and bug-free."
