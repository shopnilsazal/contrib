description: "by Barrett Clark\nAs a programmer, work-life balance has always been a tricky thing for me. Steve Wozniak commented that “you can’t stop the steamroller of technology change.” That notion has been applied to software. If you rest you risk being squished.\nI wrestle with impostor syndrome, and maybe this is just an extension of that. As a rubyist it’s difficult to keep up. Everything evolves quickly (ruby, rails, gems, related technologies, methodologies). I consider myself a full stack developer, and a stubborn one at that. I’ve fought with a Makefile for weeks just to get some package to compile on some *nix variant.\nWe are paid for our ability to solve problems. It requires a lot of practice. I’ve learned to be ok with not knowing how to do things, but I still “hear the footsteps.” I don’t really know what it means to be “good enough” yet, but this talk will explore those lines between work/life balance and how we keep our edge on the job while being present in the moments off the job.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GWIc/"
