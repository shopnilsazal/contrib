description: "PyData London 2018\n\nDeep learning is making astrophysicists excited and afraid. We're excited because we can show a neural network every galaxy in the sky and ask questions, and afraid because we don't understand the answers. I'll talk about how you can investigate galaxy evolution with TensorFlow and crowdsourced labels, what we're discovering, and where it all falls apart.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
