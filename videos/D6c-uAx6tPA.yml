recordingDate: 1391644438
description: "Damon McCoy: Zulu a Command Line Wireless Frame Generator\n\nAbstract: Zulu is a light weight 802.11 wireless frame generation tool to enable fast and easy debugging and probing of 802.11 networks. It has an intuitive command line interface and operates with the unmodified madwifi-ng and partially with prism based Linux network drivers. Individual fields in frames can be set or unset, generating frames that possibly violate the IEEE 802.11 protocol. It can generate all control, data, and management frame types and subtypes. The user-friendly command line options enable novice users to quickly generate custom frames with a combination of values placed in different frame fields. Zulu is freely available under the GNU license. \n\nBios: Damon McCoy has worked in a variety of industry and government positions. Currently he is a Doctoral Candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He has also worked at Sandia National Laboratories in the Center for Cyber Defenders. Prior to this he worked for IBM in the Emergency Response Services group as a network security consultant. Before this he worked for both AT&T Research and Lucent Bell Laboratories. Anmol Sheth is a Doctoral Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He received his B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Pune, India in 2001. His research interests include MAC layer protocol design, fault tolerant distributed wireless systems and energy- efficient wireless communication."
