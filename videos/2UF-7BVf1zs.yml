description: "Simulation sickness, when a player feels sick after playing a game, has recently received more attention due to the promotion of VR headsets in the gaming space. VR is notorious for producing simulation sickness, but some players can experience simulation sickness in a wide range of games, with or without VR. In this talk, given at GDC Europe 2015, Ben Lewis-Evans covers basic game design guidelines, based on research that can be followed by developers to reduce the risk of simulation sickness, both in VR and as a general aid to making their game more accessible to a wide range of players.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
