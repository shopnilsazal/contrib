description: "Kyran Dale - Data-visualisation with Python and Javascript: crafting a data-viz toolchain for the web\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nTo accompany an upcoming O'Reilly book 'Data-visualisation with Python\nand Javascript: crafting a dataviz toolchain for the web' (see\n[here][1]) this talk aims to sketch out the toolchain by transforming\nsome dry Wikipedia data (Nobel prize-winners) into a far more engaging\nand insightful web-visualisation. This transformative cycle uses\nPython big-hitters such as Scrapy, Pandas and Flask, the latter\ndelivering data to Javascript's D3.\n\nWhile Python is fast becoming the goto language for data-\nprocessing/science, the visual fruits of that labour hit the wall of\nthe web, where there is only one first-class language, Javascript. To\ndevelop a data-viz toolchain for the modern world, where web-\npresentation is increasingly mandated, making Python and Javascript\nplay nicely is fundamental. This talk aims to show that the perceived\nwall between the two languages is actually a thin, permeable membrane\nand that, with a bare minimum of web-dev, one can get on with\nprogramming seamlessly in both.\n\n[1]: http://kyrandale.com/blog/data-visualization-python-javascript/"
