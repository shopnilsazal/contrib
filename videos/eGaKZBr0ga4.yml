recordingDate: 1398696182
description: "By Noel Rappin\n\nSmalltalk has mystique. We talk about it more than we use it.\nIt seems like it should be so similar to Ruby. It has similar Object-Oriented structures, it even has blocks.\nBut everything is so slightly different, from the programming environment, to the 1-based arrays, to the simple syntax. Using Smalltalk will make you look at familiar constructs with new eyes.\nWe'll show you how to get started on Smalltalk, and walk through some sample code. Live coding may be involved.\nYou'll never look at objects the same way again.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2V/"
