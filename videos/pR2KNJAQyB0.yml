title: 'To bounty, or not to bounty? Security@ insights from 500 organizations - Alex Rice - AppSec Ca 2016'
recordingDate: 1458611251
description: "Security@ addresses across the internet are experiencing a surge in activity as organizations embrace collaboration with the security researcher community through vulnerability disclosure programs. In our journey to uncover the perfect approach, one thing became certain: every organization is wildly unique and there is no one size fits all answer. To understand what exactly contributes to a successful program, we've analyzed aggregate Security@ data from over 500 organizations and devised a weighted index across six dimensions:\n\n* Researcher Breadth\n* Researcher Depth\n* Vulnerabilities Found\n* Response Efficiency\n* Reward Competitiveness\n* Signal Ratio\n\nThe result is an advanced framework for quantifying impact and assessing the performance of these programs. Whether you already run an active bug bounty program or still have a security@ address that bounces, you can expect this talk to help you shed blind dogma and walk away armed with an analytical approach to running an effective Security@.\n\nAlex Rice\nAlex Rice is a co-founder and the Chief Technology Officer at HackerOne, providing a platform that enables organizations to build strong relationships with a community of security experts.
