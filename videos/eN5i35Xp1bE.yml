description: "Just as Cloud as SaaS changed how networks and applications are built, they also changed how we secure them. Now, we may be on the brink of the next major shift in philosophy toward “mutualization of enterprise infrastructure,” decentralization of data aggregators, and (maybe??) incentivizing everyone everywhere with shiny cryptoeconomic tokens (probably not).\n\nIn this keynote, Amber Baldet will pick out the truly intriguing signal from the mass of blockchain hype, discussing what’s practical, what’s probable, and what’s possible – as well as what’s actually actionable, today – including why anyone whose interests or livelihood intersect with information security or data privacy should be getting involved and now.\n\n=== \n\nAmber leads J.P. Morgan’s Blockchain Center of Excellence, tasked with setting a comprehensive blockchain strategy for the Corporate and Investment Bank, developing cutting edge technology, curating Strategic Investments, and performing client outreach. She chairs the Financial Industry Working Group within the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and leads Product Development for the open source Quorum platform. Appearing on 2017’s Fortune’s 40 Under 40 list of the most influential young people in business, she “handily bridges the divide between the Wall Street and crypto sets.”"
