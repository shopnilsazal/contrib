description: "by Fabian Pinckaers\r\n\r\nI propose to show OpenObject in action, how you can customize or develop new modules for OpenERP. It includes: the object and view editor, the workflow editor and the report designer. \r\n\r\nOpenERP is a modern Enterprise Management Software, released under the AGPL license, and featuring CRM, HR, Sales, Accounting, Manufacturing, Stock. It is based on OpenObject, a modular, scalable, and intuitive Rapid Application Development (RAD) framework written in Python. \r\n\r\nOpenObject features a complete and modular toolbox for quickly building applications: integrated Object-Relationship Mapping (ORM) support, template-based Model-View-Controller (MVC) interfaces, a report generation system, automated internationalization, and much more. \r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nâ—¦http://openerp.com \r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world.
