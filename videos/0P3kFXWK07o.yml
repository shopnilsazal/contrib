language: English
recordingDate: 1459526835
description: "In early 2011, Klei Entertainment started development on a new IP game called Don't Starve. Having worked successfully with traditional publishers for our previous console titles, we decided to experiment with a different approach. Through a rapid development process that was tightly bound to community building, Don't Starve went from a 16-hour game jam to a million-unit success. This 2014 talk from Klei's Kevin Forbes  recounts the game's development, from its concept to eventual success, describing its unlikely rise, and sharing both learnings and data around community engagement.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
