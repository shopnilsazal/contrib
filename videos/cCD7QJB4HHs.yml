description: "Avoiding complexity is one of the greatest goals in programming. The tools we use, libraries and frameworks, must be helping us in achieving that goal. There must be a reasonable balance between convenience and simplicity as growing complexity is the price we pay for that convenience.\n\nThis talk is about seeking simplicity when dealing with data and behavior showing alternative approaches to object relational mapping and persistence concerns.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGY1/"
