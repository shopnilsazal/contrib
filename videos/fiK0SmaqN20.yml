description: "Emulators used to be one of the areas of computing that I considered magic. After digging around, I realized that some emulators are very well documented. I wondered what an emulator would look like if it was built around Clojure data structures, and what we might be able to do with them. This talk focuses on my attempt to build a time travelling NES and what Iâ€™ve learned along the way!\n\nAngus has been writing Clojure for a few years now, for both work and fun. He likes books, cycling, cooking, and writing programs."
