recordingDate: 1493974078
description: "I have made a ‘magic mirror’ – (an example of what that is: https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/magic-mirror/ (Disclaimer: This is NOT mine!).\n\nThis talk will cover how to build your own with a Raspberry Pi after which I will discuss how I made mine more secure. The last part of the talk will discuss some further enhancements I want to make to create a device that is more like something like we see in science fiction movies/novels.\n\n===\n\nI’m a Software and Security Tester with 15 years of experience in programming, security testing, source code review, test automation, functional and technical analysis, development and database design. I have a constant drive to learn new things. I have a passion for secure application development. I have created several courses on testing software for security problems and I teach courses on secure coding, security awareness, security testing, mobile application security and threat modelling."
