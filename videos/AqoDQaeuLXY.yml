description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nTL;DR NIST Container Security Standards - Elsie Phillips, CoreOS (Beginner Skill Level)\n\nIn September 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology issued a 63 page paper detailing their recommendations for container security. While it’s chock-full of recommendations all cloud native users should implement, it’s not a text most people will read. In this talk, Elsie Phillips from CoreOS will cover key takeaways from the report like the importance of using container-specific host OSs and using tooling specific to containers to monitor for vulnerabilities, as well as some suggestions for how to implement them within an organization.\n\nAbout Elsie\nElsie herds the CoreOS Community and Co-Leads the Kubernetes Contributor Experience SIG. She's a northwest native who got her start in open source working at the Oregon State University Open Source Lab. In her free time she throws wild one woman dance parties and makes a mean vegan chocolate chip cookie."
