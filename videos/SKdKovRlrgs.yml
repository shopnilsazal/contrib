description: "Rapture is a collection of libraries for everyday programming tasks like I/O, JSON & XML processing and cryptography, with a focus on beautiful, concise and intuitive code. Rapture packs a lot of power into a single line of code, and Jon will race through fifty of Rapture's smartest one-liners faster than one-a-minute, showing you how easy it is to perform everyday file and network I/O, structured data and cryptography operations, without compromising type safety. All the code in the talk will be easy for beginners to understand, but more advanced developers may also learn some new tricks, so there should be something for everyone!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FpFz/"
