title: 'QoS Challenges for Real Time Traffic Deployable QoS Using the NEAT System'
language: English
recordingDate: 1520511420
description: "by Tom Jones ([tj])\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nQuality of Service markings can benefit real time traffic. A survey weconducted on a mobile cellular testbed (Monroe) has revealed howdifferentiated services traffic is treated in practical networks, and showsmany networks do not respect diffserv markings resulting unpredictable real-time performance.\n\nThis motivates a change to the network programming API for real-time trafficto provide dynamic transport selection and fallback, enabling successful useof network QoS. The API is presented in the context of theNEAT[1](https://neat-project.org) open source project.\n\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 14:55:00"
