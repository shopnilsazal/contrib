description: "RubyConf 2017: \"RSpec no longer works with ActiveRecord\" by Sam Phippen\n\nSometimes an email appears in front of you in your inbox that immediately grabs your attention. For me, this was the case with a particularly scarily titled RSpec Mocks bug.\n\nIn this talk, you'll hear a story of investigation and fixing of what could have been a day ruining bug for all RSpec users. You'll come away with some deeper knowledge about RSpec's mocking library. You'll learn some protips on good practise when making an open source bug report. If you've ever used with RSpec's mocking library and would like to learn more about deep Ruby metaprogramming this talk is for you."
