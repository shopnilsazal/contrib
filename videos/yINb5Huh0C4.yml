description: 'During GDC 2015, Warren Robinett, the veteran programmer, designer and The Learning Company founder known for his groundbreaking work at Atari, TLC and NASA, delivered a fascinating Classic Game Postmortem on the creation of his hit 1979 game Adventure for the Atari 2600. Adventure is particularly notable for being arguably the first graphical action-adventure game ever released, and the first title with a hidden ''Easter Egg''.'
