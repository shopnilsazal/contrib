title: 'iOS App Integrity: Got Any? - OWASP AppSecUSA 2014'

description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\nThursday, September 18 • 1:00pm - 1:45pm\n\niOS App Integrity: Got Any?\n\niOS apps are vulnerable to static analysis and attack through binary code patching. Incorporating jailbreak and debugger detection algorithms can be rendered useless with a quick binary patch. Once patched the app can be further exploited, its app data stolen, and even cloned. The iMAS research team, the team that brought Encrypted CoreData (ECD) to Github open source, has your back! At this talk we will introduce open source Encrypted Code Modules (ECM) as a technique to protect sensitive enterprise iOS applications. Using ECM as the base we will demonstrate an iOS app anti-tamper technique that is considerably more resistant to patching. We will walk through this step-by-step process to make your iOS apps more secure and … authentic.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\nGavin Black\nLead Software Engineer, MITRE\nGavin Black is a lead software engineer working for the MITRE Corp, a federal research and development center. Currently he has been focused on software security and systems defense. Part of those efforts include researching and developing controls to mitigate weaknesses in iOS mobile applications. He's also working with the Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) analyst toolchain, attempting to streamline the process and modernize the end-to-end software.\n\nGregg Ganley\nPrincipal Investigator iOS Security Research, MITRE Corp\n23+ software development and management experience Education: MSCS, BSEE.
