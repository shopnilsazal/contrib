description: "Selling Food With Elixir by Chris Bell\n\n\"For the past 6 months we’ve been working with a client to build a Phoenix powered API for processing online food orders and delivering them to restaurants. Along the way we’ve built a series of services, written with OTP, that are resilient in the face of unpredictable third party APIs and store outages, able to handle failure in isolation, and scale to the demands of an expanding restaurant chain.\nThis talk will walk through some of the services outlined above as well as covering:\nThe overall architecture of the project and the OTP applications it’s composed of.\nThinking outside of the database; using ETS and process state to power our real-time restaurant availability service.\nBatched processing without job queues; using plain OTP concepts to build a service that’s designed for failure.\nSome gotchas we learned on the way to production.\""
