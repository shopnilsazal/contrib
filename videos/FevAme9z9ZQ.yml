Howard has been building, growing, and leading great game development teams for many years. Previous roles include the executive producer Microsoft Flight and APB at Realtime Worlds, the senior vice president of Online Development at Hidden City Games, and studio manager for Microsoftâ€™s casual games studio.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
