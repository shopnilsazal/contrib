description: "Next Generation Services at Indeed Using gRPC [I] - Jaye Pitzeruse, Indeed.com\n\nAt Indeed, we use an internal framework for interprocess communication called Boxcar. Boxcar was developed in 2010 and provides built-in advantages when used with Indeed’s infrastructure. This framework was originally built as a proof of concept and only targeted Java as a supported language. Due to this limitation, it has not scaled with Indeed’s growth and adoption of more and more languages. Recently, Indeed has started to experiment with gRPC as a replacement for the framework. In this talk, we’ll describe our existing service infrastructure and the changes we made in order to support gRPC. We’ll also discuss the strategy we used to migrate existing Boxcar services over to using gRPC. Finally, we’ll compare benchmarks between Boxcar and the new gRPC-based system. Other technologies mentioned in the talk: linkerd for load balancing, opentracing.\n\nAbout Jaye Pitzeruse\nSenior Software Engineer working out of Indeed's Austin tech office for the last 4 years. Today, I own the distributed services framework that drives many of the systems at Indeed. I also work with our Services Infrastructure Group to expand our service capabilities. Such capabilities include supporting HTTP2 based communication, securing existing interprocess communication, and centralizing load balancing between services."
