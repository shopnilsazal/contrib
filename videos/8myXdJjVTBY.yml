description: "Björn Ganslandt takes the audience on a web archaeology and explores Space Jam, a website that has been largely unchanged since 1996.

The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developers playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
