description: "Go's clean syntax and built in garbage collection make it a breeze to write programs quickly. But as you go further down the rabbit hole, understanding your program's memory consumption and behaviours becomes important. \n\nIn this talk I will explain the difference between using values and references (pointers) and explain the usage of `make` and built-in datatypes (like slices and maps). Along the way, I will present a few common mistakes, and give a few tips on how to avoid them."
