description: "Anti-social behavior in games is a problem that is gaining increased awareness. What players can do, and how they can take responsibility for their actions. But what can game designers do? And specifically how can they design games to reduce the anti-social behavior that occurs within them? Ben Lewis-Evans from Player Research used this GDC 2015 talk to provide possible answers to these questions, supported by best practice psychological principles and concrete examples from existing games.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
