recordingDate: 1529097076
description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Marius Constantin and Stanojko Markovik, ContentSquare.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-49\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/smarkovik/better-faster-code-reviews\n\nEveryone knows you need to do code reviews, but with more than 2-3 developers, and in a sprint with 10+ tasks in the backlog, this is becoming an issue. This presentation will be about how we have managed to overcome this challenge and how we have made code reviews fast, efficient, and a part of our daily routine (without adding them to the list of tasks). We will emphasize on the Git approach and the methodologies around this and similar tools. We will share all our trials, fails and wins and discuss how we can make this work for you too.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
