As Spotify has ramped up its use of Kubernetes and other cloud native software, we have also been working on involving ourselves more in the community around that software. Dave will talk about how Spotify is changing its approach and culture around infrastructure to be more open and to be more involved in the infrastructure software community.\n\nAbout Dave\nDave Zolotusky is a software engineer on Spotify's Infrastructure and Operations team in Stockholm, Sweden. His team builds and maintains the core platform that the rest of Spotify runs on. Before joining Spotify, Dave worked at Amazon Web Services, VMware, and Microsoft.\n\nWant to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?
