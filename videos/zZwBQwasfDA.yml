description: "Niv/tomr - Learning Chess from data\n[EuroPython 2014]\n[24 July 2014]\n\nIs watching a chess game enough to figure out the rules?\nWhat is common denominator between different plays and game ending?\nIn this presentation, we will show how Machine Learning and Hadoop \ncan help us re-discover chess rules and gain new understanding of the game.\n\n-----\n\nCan empirical samples unveil the big picture?\nIs chess games descriptions expose good enough data to gain understanding of chess rules - legal piece moves, castling, check versus checkmate, etc.\nWhich features are important in describing a chess game and which features are not. What is a good representation of a chess game for this uses.\nWhat is the minimal sample size which is required in order to learn this in a good enough manner and where this learning can go wrong.\n\n\n**Ne3  =&gt;  E=mc2**\n\nLooking at the bigger picture - Can we understand big systems based on empirical samples.\nCan we reverse engineer physics and discover how physical system work based on no external knowledge beside empirical samples."
