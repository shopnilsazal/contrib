description: "Copy of the slides for this talk are here: https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Xenofex/DEFCON-20-Xenofex-Panel-Hacking-the-GoogleTV.pdf\nHacking the Google TV\nAmir \"Zenofex\" Etemadieh\nCJ Heres\nDan Rosenberg\nTom \"tdweng\" Dwenger\n\nThe GoogleTV platform is designed to bring an integrated web experience, utilizing the Chrome web browser and Android applications, to your television. GoogleTV is based on the Android operating system, which is mainly used in tablets and smart phones, but customized with security features not normally seen on most Android devices. The current version of the platform utilizes signatures to establish a \"chain of trust\" from bootloader to system applications.\n\nThis presentation will focus on the current GoogleTV devices, including X86 platform details, and the exhaustive security measures used by each device. The presentation will also include video demonstrations of previously found bugs and exploits for each GoogleTV device and includes specific details about how each bug works. Furthermore, we will include interesting experiences that the team has encountered along the way. Finally the talk will be capped off with the release of multiple unpublished GoogleTV exploits which will allow unsigned kernels across all x86 devices (Revue / Sony GoogleTV).\n\nAmir \"Zenofex\" Etemadieh founded the GTVHacker group and has been working on the GTVHacker project from its initial start in November 2010. Amir has done independent security research in consumer electronics including the Logitech Revue, Ooma Telo, Samsung Galaxy S2, Boxee Box and services such as the 4G Clear Network finding both hardware and software flaws.\nTwitter: @zenofex\nhttp://blog.gtvhacker.com\nhttp://www.gtvhacker.com\n\nCJ Heres is an IT consultant during the day, tinkerer at night.
