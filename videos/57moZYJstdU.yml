description: "DevOps Friendly Doc Publishing for APIs & Microservices - Amanda Whaley, Cisco DevNet\n\nMicroservices create an explosion of internal and external APIs. These APIs need great docs. Many organizations end up with a jungle of wiki pages, swagger docs and API consoles. Keeping docs updated and in sync with code can be a challenge. We’ve been working on a project to help solve this problem for engineering teams internally across Cisco. The goal is to create a forward looking developer and API doc publishing pipeline that:\n\n- Has a developer friendly editing flow\n- Accepts many API spec formats (Swagger, RAML, etc)\n- Supports long form documentation in markdown\n- Is CI/CD pipeline friendly so that code and docs stay in sync\n- Is flexible enough to be used by a wide scope of teams and technologies\n\nThis session will share many lessons learned about tooling and attendees will learn how to solve documentation challenges for internal and external facing APIs. We have found that solving this doc publishing flow is a key component of a building modern infrastructure.\n\nAbout Amanda Whaley\nAmanda Whaley is Director of Developer Experience & Developer Evangelism for Cisco DevNet. She spends most of her time thinking about how developers use Cisco APIs, and about how to make their job easier. She also leads a team of developer evangelists who work with Cisco partners and developers in many technology areas including IoT, Collaboration, and Software Defined Networking. Amanda has a background in application development and engineering, and she is interested in all things that help developers build cool stuff – tools, APIs, docs, frameworks.
