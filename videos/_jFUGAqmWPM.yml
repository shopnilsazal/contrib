description: "Vitaliy Kamlyuk: Fighting Malware on your own.\n\nThere is always a possibility to get infected by some malware, i.e. by surfing the web and catching the malware that uses some new exploit in your browser. What should you do then? Do you know what is available on Windows system to fight malware? The problem of fighting malware on Windows is the limitation of basically available tools. I am going to show you some tricks that will let you do some complicated actions using ONLY components of Windows system and NO 3rd party tools.\n\nI have been working in Kaspersky Lab for 2 years. I've started as a developer&researcher and at some points worked as unix adminitrator. Today I am working as virus analyst. This position gave me the knowledge of deep understanding of the majority of modern Windows technologies. As a result I learnt how to do the programming in machine code. My presentation will show you the cases when this knowledge is mandatory. I am going to show how to develop an antivirus solution using Windows notepad and the knowledge of machine code programming. Besides, I am going to show several hacks to perform complicated tasks in limited Windows environment. \n\nHaving rich experience of taking part in different conferences. Have received more than dozen awards and prizes during education at school and university. Have been working in Kaspersky Lab Moscow since 2005. Started as C++ developer, but changed positions several times. Worked as a FreeBSD system administrator, virus analyst and finally doing forensic examination. Inventor of the technology that is used in KL for finding similar malicious files in huge storages (the technology was successfully submitted for patenting in 2006)."
