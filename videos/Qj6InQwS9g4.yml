recordingDate: 1383815432
description: "Marco Bonetti - Mobile Privacy: Tor on the iPhone and Other Unusual Devices\n\nMobile phones are still a proving ground for keeping the users' privacy safe. This presentation will describe the problems which are arising around the use of these technologies and how they can affect mobile users. It will propose Tor as a possible solution for some of these problems, describing its own strengths and weaknesses and the efforts developers put to implement a working port of the program on different devices, from the Chumby One to my own port for the iPhone platform. Finally, it will also describe where the development is going to protect mobile phone users privacy and let them survive their own devices.\n\nMarco Bonetti is a Computer Science engineer with a lot of passion for free and open source operating systems. Interested in privacy and security themes, he's following the emerging platforms for the protection of privacy in hostile enviroments. As he didn't find any suitable distribution for his PowerBook, he created Slackintosh: the unofficial PowerPC port of the famous Slackware Linux distribution. He's currently working as a security consultant for CutAway.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
