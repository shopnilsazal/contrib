Percoco, Sean Schulte - This is REALLY not the droid you're looking for...\nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-19/dc-19-presentations/Percoco-Spiderlabs/DEFCON-19-Percoco-Spiderlabs-Droid.pdf\n\nExtra Materials Here: https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-19/dc-19-presentations/Percoco-Spiderlabs/Extras/DEFCON-19-Percoco-Droid-BanthaPudu-1.0.apk\n\nLast year, we presented a talk on the implication of malware and rootkits on mobile devices. We focused on the kernel layer of the Android OS stack. With the proliferation of Apps of every size, shape and color being published this year, we focused solely upon the User Interface (UI) of the Android OS. The results of our research yielded a very dangerous flaw that is likely going to require a UI overhaul of the Android OS. Our talk will demonstrate a technique using legitimate and documented APIs to steal credentials and other user information from the most popular Apps in the Android Market. We will demo this technique live and provide a technical walkthrough of the specific methods being used. At the conclusion of our talk, we'll release a Proof of Concept (PoC) built to demo this technique.\n\nNicholas J.
