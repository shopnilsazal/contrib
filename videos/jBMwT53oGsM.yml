description: "I Estimate this Talk will be 20 Minutes Long, Give or Take 10 Minutes by Noel Rappin\n\nEstimates are like weather forecasts. Getting them right is hard, and everybody complains when you are wrong. Estimating projects is often critically important to the people who pay us to develop software.\n\nWe can do better. We can focus our estimates on the parts we do well, like estimating complexity. We can present estimates without falsely inflating them, and we can be transparent during the development process. The humble point estimate can help you, if you understand its limitations.\n\nBetter estimates and communication of estimates will make your projects run more smoothly.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H0zn/"
