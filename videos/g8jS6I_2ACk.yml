Not easy when Big Data has been so overhyped, Berkeley University compiled a list of 40 competing, contradictory definitions.

As Thomas Davenport said, \"Vendors and consultants will take any new, hot term and apply it to their existing offerings…and that has already happened in spades with Big Data.\" In this talk, Big Nimble founder Michael Kauffman cuts through the techno-babble and marketing fog to explain what Big Data actually is and how to use it.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/L7Sq/"
