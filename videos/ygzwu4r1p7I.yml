Existing file-system reliability methods, such as checksums, redundancy, or transactional updates, merely ensure that the corruption is reliably preserved. The typical workarounds, based on using backups or repairing the file system, are painfully slow. Worse, the recovery is performed long after the original error occurred and thus may result in further corruption and data loss. We present a system called Recon that protects file system metadata from buggy file system operations. Our approach leverages modern file systems that provide crash consistency using transactional updates. We define declarative statements called consistency invariants for a file system. These invariants must be satisfied by each transaction being committed to disk to preserve file system integrity. Recon checks these invariants at commit, thereby minimizing the damage caused by buggy file systems."
