recordingDate: 1384991044
description: "Sharepoint 2007 Knowledge Network Exposed\nDigividual\n\nMicrosoft released a free add on to Microsoft Sharepoint Server 2007 called the Knowledge Network. At the time it seemed like an entry in the Total Information Awareness initiative, though it was never called that in any official form. This talk will dissect the features offered by the Knowledge Network and offer speculations as to what Microsoft might have running already.\n\nDigividual has 15 years experience developing software on a variety of platforms and frameworks. Lately he has been busy trying to build castles in clouds.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
