recordingDate: 1479496487
description: "Presentation slides: http://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/nikhil-garg-engineering-manager-quora-at-mlconf-sf-2016\n\nBuilding a Machine Learning Platform at Quora: Each month, over 100 million people use Quora to share and grow their knowledge. Machine learning has played a critical role in enabling us to grow to this scale, with applications ranging from understanding content quality to identifying users’ interests and expertise. By investing in a reusable, extensible machine learning platform, our small team of ML engineers has been able to productionize dozens of different models and algorithms that power many features across Quora.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll discuss the core ideas behind our ML platform, as well as some of the specific systems, tools, and abstractions that have enabled us to scale our approach to machine learning."
