description: "By: Jason Dean\n\nGreat software is only possible in a true Learning Organization. This talk gives a pragmatic exploration of the connections between Sengeâ€™s five disciplines for learning organizations and the Agile software development framework. Specifically making use of Sengeâ€™s three legged stool of Aspiration, Understanding Complexity, and Reflective Conversation, Agile provides a strong pattern for creating and changing the realities of business and customer value delivery."
