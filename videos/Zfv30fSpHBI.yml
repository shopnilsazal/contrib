description: "RailsConf 2018: Devly, a multi-service development environment by Eric Hodel & Ezekiel Templin\n\nDevly, a multi-service development environment\nWriting a system alone is hard. Building many systems with many people is harder.\n\nAs our company has grown, we tried many approaches to user-friendly, shared development environments and learned what works and what doesn't. We incorporated what we learned into a tool called devly. Devly is used to develop products at Fastly that span many services written in different languages.\n\nWe learned that the design of our tools must be guided by how teams work and communicate. To respond to these needs, Devly allows self-service, control, and safety so that developers can focus on their work."
