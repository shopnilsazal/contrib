Python is well used in high-throughput screening and target validation with a notable example at AstraZeneca displayed prominently on the python.org website but further along the drug development process Python and it's scientific stack offers a compelling and comphrensive toolkit for use in preclinical and clinical drug development.\n\nIn this talk, a demonstration of how Python/SciPy was used to calculate cardiac liability of a drug was assessed as part of routine preclinical screen, how Python was used to statistically analyse a Phase II clinical dataset and how Python was used organise and structure documentation about a new chemical entity according to regulated standards for submission to the European Medicines Agency. Lastly, the talk will conclude with the current barriers to progress for Python to be used more routinely for pharmaceutical problems and how the community might address Python being used in a heavily regulated environment."
