description: "Adam Bresson, Identification Evasion: Knowledge and Countermeasures\nEveryday you\"re right to privacy is being compromised! From security cameras, to illegal searches, to unauthorized monitoring you are being watched. You must protect yourself...and your rights. Using Identification Evasion, you can immediately strengthen your protections. I\"ll discuss knowledge and countermeasures in the Computer and Real Worlds while presenting many great methods to turn the tables on surveillance. In addition to other in-depth demonstrations and examples, you\"ll see Identification Evasion in action as I present the video \"Night As Jason Biggs\" (for the first time, unedited) where I applied these techniques in Las Vegas. You\"ll learn some things, enjoy the talk and be entertained!\n\nAdam Bresson (adambresson.com) works during the day as an I.T. Manager for a Santa Monica Investment Banking firm. He also hosts a weekly Los Angeles open mic night, independently codes commercial web sites and challenges corrupt authority as often as possible. At DEFCON 8, he spoke on Palm Security. At DEFCON 9, he spoke on PHP, Data Mining and Web Security. At DEFCON 10, he spoke on Consumer Media Protections (CMP) generating considerable industry interest and press. At DEFCON 11, he spoke on Manyonymity: PHP Distributed Encryption releasing a GPL\"ed suite of web application tools. Can you recognize him?"
