description: "It's the moment you’ve been dreading: the project of redesigning all consumer facing emails AND making them responsive becomes yours. And you've heard the rumors: designing emails means coding like it’s 1999, creating tables and adding styles inline (heaven forbid!), and throwing best practices and hopes of compatibility out the window. BREATHE. In this session, I’ll share the tips and tricks I learned, and help you get your emails in shape for 2015 and ready for the responsive spotlight.\n\nJENNIFER WONG\n\nJennifer Wong is a self taught web developer. She spends her days on the front end, making the web a prettier and more functional place. In a former life, she was a civil engineer and is still a registered Engineer in Training (No. EIT 121059) with the California Department of Consumer Affairs. She's a jane of all trades and loves eating, coding, and sleeping.\n\nhttp://mochimachine.org/\nhttps://twitter.com/mybluewristband"
