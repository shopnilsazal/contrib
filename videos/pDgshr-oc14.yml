Typed holes are a feature in Haskell, where programmers can specify “holes” in expressions and have the compiler relate information about those holes inferred from the context. Our contribution is an extension to the functionality of these holes where type directed search is used to suggest valid substitutions for those holes to the programmer. This extension has been accepted into GHC.\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2018/matthias-pall-gissurarson"
