description: "The itty, bitty, tiny bytes that make up a Pokemon! by Jan Mitsuko Cash\n\nIn 2013, Nintendo released Pokebank, an app that allowed players of the Pokemon game series to upload and store creatures called Pokemon from their games on Nintendo servers. Then it broke!\n\nPokemon are stored in a mere 232 bytes, yet players from Japan uploaded so many of them to Nintendo’s servers that the Pokebank app’s release was delayed by months in the US and Europe – but that’s not the only thing that’s interesting about the Pokemon data structure. Learn about what the data structure looks like and how it’s adapted over the last 22 years and over four different consoles!"
