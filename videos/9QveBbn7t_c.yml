Thankfully, there there is a FunFunFunction episode for that, and you can watch it here: So, what is a monad? Remember that a Functor is an object that implements *map*? Well, a monad is a more powerful functor that also implements *flatMap*.\n\nCode from the episode\nhttps://gist.github.com/mpj/ca167aad371c67372f3b\n\nMad props to @drboolean for helping me to understand Monads.
