description: "Despite the attention that impostor syndrome has gotten in the Ruby community recently, so many amazing developers still hide in fear of being discovered as frauds. These developers chalk their achievements up to everything except their own talent and don't believe they deserve their success. I know, because I've struggled with impostor syndrome my whole career. In this talk, I'll show you what makes impostor syndrome so powerful and how you can break free from the grip it has on your life.\n\nNickolas Means is a software engineer at WellMatch Health and spends his days remote pairing from Austin, TX. He's an advocate for all things pairing, and thinks vulnerability and egolessness are the two most important virtues in software development.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0l/"
