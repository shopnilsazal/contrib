description: "Abstract: \nWe're never going to be finished with the great work of securing the internet, and we will never be finished with the great work of making sure that it is a force for freedom, privacy, human rights and human flourishing. \nThese are processes, not products, and surrender is not an option. It's tempting to just say, \"Not my dumpster, not my fire,\" and walk away, but even if you stop caring about the internet, it's not going to stop caring about you. \nThere's no winning and there's no losing. There's only the fight, and you're on the front lines.\n\nby Cory Doctorow - Science Fiction Author, Activist and Journalist\n\nWebsite https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow\n\nCory Doctorow (craphound.com) is a science fiction author, activist, journalist and blogger — the co-editor of Boing Boing (boingboing.net) and the author of WALKAWAY, a novel for adults, a YA graphic novel called IN REAL LIFE, the nonfiction business book INFORMATION DOESN’T WANT TO BE FREE, and young adult novels like HOMELAND, PIRATE CINEMA and LITTLE BROTHER and novels for adults like RAPTURE OF THE NERDS and MAKERS.
