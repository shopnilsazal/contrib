description: "Description from DEF CON 9 Speakerâ€™s Page:\n\n8 Bits and 8 Pins: More Fun With Micro controller Hacking\n\n\"Microcontrollers\" are microprocessors with additional peripherals, I/O controls, and memory all built into one chip. Last year, Phil introduced the wonderful world of 8-bit micro controllers and showed how to set up your own project development lab.\_ This year he looks at more fun, cute, and devious electronic devices you can build, this time focusing on micro controllers with only 8 pins.\_ What can you do with 2K of code spaces and only a few I/O lines?\_ More than you might imagine!\_ We'll look at various tiny projects, and see what can be done in small space and on\_ a small budget.\_ Bring your questions and project ideas. The people with the best ideas will go home with a complete Atmel AVR micro controller hardware development package.\n\nThis talk will have a fairly high fun-factor looking at cool electronic toys, but there will be talk about and examples of low-level code and hardware design.\_ Some programming experience and electronics vocabulary will definitely make the material more understandable.\n\nPhil King is a hardware design engineer in Silicon Valley with 9 years of experience at various hardware and software jobs.\_ He is also a part time lecturer at Stanford University, where he co-taught EE-281, the graduate level Embedded Systems Design Lab course last fall."
