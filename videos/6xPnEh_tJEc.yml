description: "PyData London 2018\n\nWord embeddings is a very convenient and efficient way to extract semantic information from large collections of textual or textual-like data. We will be presenting an exploration and comparison of the performance of \"traditional\" embeddings techniques like word2vec and GloVe as well as fastText and StarSpace in NLP related problems such as metaphor and sarcasm detection\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
