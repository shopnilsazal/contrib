description: "Finding out what's really going on, with DTrace! By Colin Jones\nIt's super-frustrating to run into an issue you don't understand. I hate feeling powerless like that. But luckily DTrace has our backs!\n\nIn this talk, I'll show you how DTrace can answer incredibly specific questions to test our hypotheses when trouble strikes, and help us to generate new questions and hypotheses. And along the way, it'll become clear that it's not as scary of a tool as it might first appear!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/K6uu/"
