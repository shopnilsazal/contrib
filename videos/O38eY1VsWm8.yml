description: 'As internet DDoS attacks get bigger and more elaborate, the importance of high performance network traffic filtering increases. Attacks of hundreds of millions of packets per second are now commonplace. In this session, we will introduce modern techniques for high speed network packet filtering on Linux. We will follow the evolution of the subject, starting with Iptables and userspace offload solutions (such as EF_VI and Netmap), discussing their use cases and their limitations. We will then move on to a new technology recently introduced in the Linux kernel called XDP (express data path), which works by hooking an eBPF program into the lowest possible layer in the Linux kernel network stack, allowing network traffic to be filtered at high speeds.'
