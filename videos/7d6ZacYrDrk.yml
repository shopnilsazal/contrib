description: "By: Dr. George Fairbanks\n\nBecause of Eric Evansâ€™ Domain Driven Design, agile developers are familiar with embedding their domain models in their code, but architecture and design remain hard to see from the code. How can we improve that? This session presents a new agile technical practice, an architecturally-evident coding style, that lets you drop hints to code readers so that they can correctly infer the design and architecture. It builds upon ideas like Kent Beckâ€™s Intention Revealing Method Name pattern and provides a set of lightweight coding patterns and idioms that let you express your design intent in the code.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GHFo/"
