description: "Adam Bresson - Manyonymity: PHP Distributed Encryption\nManyonymity: PHP Distributed Encryption\n\nManyonymity is an advanced, self-programmed PHP Distributed Encryption web application under the GNU GPL. Manyonymity premieres at DEFCON 11 in conjunction with a self-developed, new theory of encryption: geometric transformation. Manyonymity is a customizable, easily-maintained PHP Distributed Encryption web application including verified installation, maintenance and a powerful user interface. Manyonymity allows anyone to run their own GNU GPL encryption and fingerprinting server. We'll discuss general encryption, the functionality of Manyonymity, demonstrate a sample implementation and discuss future development. Manyonymity, it's who you don't know.\n\nAdam Bresson owns GreentreePC a Los Angeles-based on-site network consulting service. At DEFCON 8, he spoke on Palm Security. At DEFCON 9, he spoke on PHP, Data Mining & Web Security. At DEFCON 10, he spoke on Consumer Media Protections (CMP) generating considerable industry interest and press.
