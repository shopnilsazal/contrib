description: "Welcome to The Xamarin Show Snack Pack Edition. A Snack Pack is bite sized episode that is focused on a specific topic and covered in just a few minutes. Today, we take a look at Plugins for Xamarin and Windows enabling developers to access native functionality from shared code. Plugins for Xamarin abstract several APIs across iOS, Android, and Windows platforms including camera, geo-location, settings, permissions, connectivity, file system, notifications, and a lot more. These plugins can be installed directly from NuGet in just a few seconds.\n\nShow Links:\n\nPlugins for Xamarin and Windows: http://xamarin.com/plugins\n\nFind James on Twitter: http://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno \nGitHub: http://github.com/jamesmontemagno\nBlog: https://montemagno.com\nand his weekly development podcast Merge Conflict: http://www.mergeconflict.fm\n\nNever Miss an Episode: https://twitter.com/thexamarinshow\nFollow @TheXamarinShow"
