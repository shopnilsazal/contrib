description: "Finally Tagless DSLs are a DSL embedding technique pioneered by Oleg Kiselyov, Jaques Carrette, and Chung-Chieh Shan that is in some sense \"dual\" to the notions of free-monad interpreters. MTL is a very popular monad library in Haskell which just so happens to be, unbeknownst to most, a Finally Tagless DSL itself.
