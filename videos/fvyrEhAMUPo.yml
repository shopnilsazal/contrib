description: "While designing the Kickstarter-backed Pillars of Eternity, Obsidian Entertainment promised to stay true to a classic RPG trope: the 6-attribute spread. In this GDC 2016 talk, Obsidian's Josh Sawyer explains both the history of this RPG design constraint, and how they evolved its concepts to make a functional RPG for the modern era. \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
