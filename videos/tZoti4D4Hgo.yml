title: 'OWASP Top 10 Mobile Risks: 2014 Reboot - Jack Mannino & Jason Haddix'
recordingDate: 1392400603
description: "The OWASP Top 10 Mobile Risks were first created in 2011. However, a lot has changed over the past three years. The mobile platforms themselves have evolved, mobile threats have evolved, and app developers have experimented with crazy new things. As a result, the OWASP Mobile Security Project decided it was the time to take another look at the threat landscape. \n\nIn this presentation, we will present the 2014 version of the OWASP Top 10 Mobile Risks for the first time. We will highlight the differences between the 2011 and 2014 versions and we will explain why some risks were added to the list, dropped altogether, elevated in criticality, or bumped down a few notches. As we present each risk that made the list, we will provide supporting data and explain the reasoning behind each entry in detail.\n\nBut what would an OWASP presentation be without also providing solutions to the problems we're pointing out? For each of the risks identified, recommended fixes will be provided for the most commonly used mobile platforms (which pretty much means iOS, Android, and if we're feeling adventurous, Windows Phone). \n  \nThe OWASP Top 10 Mobile Risks were first created in 2011.
