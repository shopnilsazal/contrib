description: "By: Travis LaFleur\n\nThe intern program at inContact uses 5-10 interns every quarter for a period of 10 weeks, and has been running for 1 1/2 years. Some of the challenges with using interns are discussed:\n*ul*\n*li*How do you on-board an entirely new team each quarter?\n*li*How do you teach them Agile?\n*li*How do they adopt the SCRUM process?\n*li*How do you take a group of new developers and help them become a Team?\n*li*Can you really get value out of 10 weeks of development?\n*/ul*"
