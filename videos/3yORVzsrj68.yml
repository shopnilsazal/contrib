Their \"closed garden\" security model has always been a fallacy and the reality on the ground paints a much bleaker picture. Why are they constantly getting hacked, and sometimes discovering it many years later or not at all?\n\nThis presentation will give a broad perspective on the security of critical systems, from the early days of Captain Crunch blue-boxing pranks up to the cyberwar reality of today where the US Air Force is publicly asking for hackers to help them mess with their enemy's infrastructures.\n\nWe will analyze recent incidents and the reasons and the origins of these difficulties. From current LTE and GPON networks to former Frame Relay, X.25 or ADSL infrastructures, attacks of these key systems are related to both mass fraudsters and expert attackers. Trying to solve both with the same methods impose unrealistic constraints and requirements for tools, teams and processes. We will see how some rare operators managed both scalability of detection and finesse in picking up weak signals of expert attacks. We will review the various telecom hacking techniques that have surfaced over the last few years and give an overview of lawful and unlawful interception systems that are being used by governments and others.\n\nWe will also present recent advances in SS7 signalling security and why those techniques could be a game-changer at the strategic level. For the privacy-conscious end-user, we will present various countermeasures and evasion techniques to foil the dystopian dream of Big Brother.\n\nABOUT PHILIPPE LANGLOIS\n\nPhilippe Langlois is an entrepreneur and leading security researcher, expert in the domain of telecom and network security. He has founded internationally recognized security companies (Qualys, WaveSecurity, INTRINsec, P1 Security) as well as led technical, development and research teams (Solsoft, TSTF). He founded Qualys and led the world-leading vulnerability assessment service. He founded a pioneering network security company Intrinsec in 1995 in France. His first business, Worldnet, France's first public Internet service provider, was founded in 1993. Philippe was also lead designer for Payline, one of the first e-commerce payment gateways.\n\nHe has written and translated security books, including some of the earliest references in the field of computer security, and has been giving speeches on network security since 1995 (Interop, BlackHat, HITB, Hack.lu). Previously a professor at Ecole de Guerre Economique and various universities in France (Amiens, Marne La Vallée) and internationally (FUSR-U, EERCI). He is a FUSR-U (Free University for Security Research) collaborator and founding member. Philippe provides industry associations (GSM Association Security Group, several national organizations) and governmental officials with Critical Infrastructure advisory conferences in Telecom and Network security.\n\nNow, Philippe is providing with P1 Security the first Core Network Telecom Signaling security scanner & auditor which help telecom companies, operators and government analyze where and how their critical telecom network infrastructure can be attacked. He can be reached through his website at: http://www.p1security.com\n\nPhilippe has previously presented at the following security/hacking conferences:\nHack.lu, Hack in the Box (HITB), Blackhat, Hackito Ergo Sum (paris, france), SOURCE, Chaos Communication Congress (Berlin, Germany), ekoparty (bueos aires, argentina), H2HC (sao paulo, brazil), SYSCAN (Hong Kong; Thailand), Bellua (Jakarta, Indonesia), INT (Mauritius), Interop...

Distressed by the apparent death of phreaking due to the introduction of the SS7 out-of-band signalling, he embarked on a decade-long quest to return this early form of telephone hacking to its former glory. In 2001 he presented the first-ever public speech about GSM security at the Black Hat briefings in Hong Kong and Singapore, followed by a streams of other presentations on that topic at major security events across Europe and Asia. In 2002 co-founded TSTF with Philippe Langlois to conduct security research on telecommunications systems and assisting mobile operators in securing their infrastructure, a Sisyphean effort in the complex and ever-changing world of mobile telecom carriers. Emmanuel has been based in Asia for almost 20 years and owns a Siamese kitten called Socket."
