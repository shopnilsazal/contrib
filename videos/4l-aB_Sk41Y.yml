description: "RailsConf 2017: Predicting Titanic Survivors with Machine Learning by Ju Liu\n\nWhat's a better way to understand machine learning than a practical example? And who hasn't watched the 1997 classic with Jack and Rose? In this talk we will first take a look at some real historical data of the event. Then we will use amazing Python libraries to live code several of the most well known algorithms. This will help us understand some fundamental concepts of how machine learning works. When we're done, you should have a good mental framework to make sense of it in the modern world."
