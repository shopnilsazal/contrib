description: "Brad Nielsen\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/185/view_talk\nPython is an ideal first programming language for secondary school students due to the simplicity of its syntax, its enforced code formatting, and the extensibility of the language. Introducing Python to a school however, takes planning, an incremental approach, and modification to existing curriculum plans based on experience. In this presentation, you will be given an overview of how a high school has introduced Python through years 8-12. You will also learn about various Python packages and environments that can be of benefit to a school including: Python Turtle, Grok Learning, Pygame, Flask, and PythonAnywhere."
