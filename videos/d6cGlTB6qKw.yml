description: "VoIP Wars: Return of the SIP \nFATIH OZAVCI INFORMATION SECURITY RESEARCHER AND CONSULTANT, VIPROY SECURITY\n\nNGN (Next Generation Network) is modern TDM/PSTN system for communication infrastructure. SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Servers are center of NGN services, they provide signaling services. SIP based communication is insecure, because of protocol implementation. Based on this fact, NGN is not actually Next Generation. It can be hacked with old stuff, but a few new attack types will be demonstrated in this presentation.\n\nThis presentation includes that basic attack types for NGN infrastructure, old school techniques for SIP analysis, a new hacking tool to analysis of SIP services and SIP Trust Hacking technique. Also a few fuzzing techniques will be explained in this presentation.\n\nSIP networks provide its services based on Trust Infrastructure. SIP Soft Switches trust each other and accept calls from trusted SIP servers. A new technique will be demonstrated in this presentation, Hacking Trust Relationships Between SIP Gateways. SIP trust will be detected and hacked with a sip trust analyzer tool. For explaining basic attack types, a few tools will be demonstrated such as footprinting, register, enumerator, bruteforcer, call analyzer and SIP proxy.\n\nAnother dangerous thing is outdated software in NGN infrastructure. VoIP devices have responsibilities to serve signaling such as MSAN, MGW and Soft Switches. They support SIP protocol with vulnerable software which should be analyzed. New fuzzing techniques such as Response based fuzzing, MITM fuzzing and proxy tool usage will be explained.\n\nFatih Ozavci (@fozavci) is a Security Researcher and Consultant of Viproy Security, Turkey. He is author of Viproy VoIP Penetration and Exploitation Testing Kit, also he has published a paper about Hacking of SIP Trust Relationships. He has discovered many unknown private security vulnerabilities, design and protocol flaws in VoIP environments for his customers. Also he analyzes VoIP design and implementation flaws, and helps to improve VoIP infrastructures as a service.\n\nWhile Fatih's primary areas of expertise are VoIP penetration testing, mobile application testing and IPTV testing, he is also well versed at network penetration testing, web application testing, reverse engineering, fuzzing and exploit development. In addition to that, he is a well-known speaker at many security events in Turkey. He is one of the speakers of Athcon 2013 and Blackhat Arsenal USA 2013, he will present his VoIP research and tools. \nViproy Security: http://viproy.com/fozavci/ \nLinkedIn: http://tr.linkedin.com/pub/fatih-ozavci/54/a71/a94 \nPacketstorm Security: http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/author/5820 \nExploit-db: http://www.exploit-db.com/author/?a=5425 \nGitHub: http://www.github.com/fozavci \nBlog: http://fozavci.blogspot.com/\n\nMaterials: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Ozavci/DEFCON-21-Ozavci-VoIP-Wars-Return-of-the-SIP-Updated.pdf \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Ozavci/Extras-Updated.zip"
