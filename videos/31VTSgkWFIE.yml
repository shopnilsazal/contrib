description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Zan Markan, Pusher.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-41\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/zmarkan/push-notifications-that-dont-suck\n\nIn the age where apps in every category battle it out against each other for conversion rates and session times, push notifications have become the de-facto way to generate repeat visits and therefore hitting those all-important KPIs. The end result? Billions of people annoyed by irrelevant notifications which are generally ignored. I believe we can do better.\n\nThis talk will cover tips and tricks for better user targeting, showing relevant content, as well as styling them using the latest and greatest of Oreo’s APIs and best practices.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
