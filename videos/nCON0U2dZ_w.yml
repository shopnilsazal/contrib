title: 'Multicluster Ingress Powered by Kubernetes Cluster Registry - Greg Harmon & Nikhil Jindal'

description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nMulticluster Ingress Powered by Kubernetes Cluster Registry - Greg Harmon & Nikhil Jindal, Google (Advanced Skill Level)\n\nMulticluster Ingress (MCI) is useful for a variety of scenarios: high-availability services, low-latency access, setting up hybrid multi-cloud and on-prem architectures, canarying clusters with new release versions and running experimental releases. In this talk, we will show how we can leverage the Cluster Registry to create multicluster ingresses with Kubernetes-style semantics. Using a controller against the Cluster Registry server, we can watch multicluster ingress resources and the list of clusters. This allows us to manage MCIs and automatically add/remove them from clusters as they are added/removed from the registry using label selection. We will also demo a sample application and show how users can make it resilient to cluster failures using multi cluster ingress.\n\nAbout Nikhil\nNikhil Jindal (nikhiljindal@github) is a Software Engineer on the kubernetes team at Google. He had started on kubernetes by working on API machinery and is now focussed on multi cluster problems. Before getting the kubernetes bug, he was enjoying working on Google Maps.\n\nAbout Greg\nGreg Harmon (G-Harmon@github) is a Software Engineer on Google’s Kubernetes team. He’s currently contributing to the multicluster efforts. Before Kubernetes he worked on Google Compute Engine for 5 years, including the launch of live migration."
