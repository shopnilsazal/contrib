title: 'YOW! 2014 Edward Kmett - Stop Treading Water: Learning to Learn'
recordingDate: 1514469935
description: "There is a notion endemic to this industry that it is sensible in the long term to learn as you go. I’ll be exploring this fairly soft notion through techniques and insights from category theory, physics, mathematics, computer science, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science to motivate techniques that you can use to invest in yourself over time and to get out of this trap.\n\nEdward spent most of his adult life trying to build reusable code in imperative languages before realizing he was building castles in sand. He converted to Haskell in 2006 while searching for better building materials. He now chairs the Haskell core libraries committee, collaborates with hundreds of other developers on over 150 projects on github, builds tools for quants and traders using the purely-functional programming-language Ermine for S&P Capital IQ, and is obsessed with finding better tools so that seven years from now he won’t be stuck solving the same problems with the same tools he was stuck using seven years ago.\n\nFor more on YOW!
