title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2013 - Matthew Brecknell - Getting Data Structures Right with GADTs & nested types'
recordingDate: 1382610047
description: "Learn about GADTs and nested data types, and how you can use them to encode structural invariants in your Haskell types. You'll also gain some insight into the inner workings of efficient functional data structures.\n\nIn the talk, I'll show a B-tree, using a GADT to maintain balance. We'll see that types not only guard against errors, but help us find the right implementation.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference and YOW!
