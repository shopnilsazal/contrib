title: 'GeeCON 2017: Jakub Kubry≈Ñski - JPA beyond copy-paste'
recordingDate: 1502694954
description: 'JPA is the main building block in most Java projects. However, a lot of developers still use it without a deep understanding of the technology, relying mainly on applying the copy-paste methodology from StackOverflow or existing system entities. During this presentation, I will consolidate knowledge about object-relational mapping. We''ll see how lazy loading works under the hood and understand the difference between a set, list or bag. We will also talk about common traps leading to significant decreases in performance or improper behavior of the system.'
