description: "Not so Neo In the Matrix by Micah Adams\n\nMatrices are powerful data structures that are used for all sorts of interesting problems- from 3d graphics, to image processing, and cryptography.

This talk attempts to demystify the matrix and offer real life examples for using this powerful but understandable data structure."
