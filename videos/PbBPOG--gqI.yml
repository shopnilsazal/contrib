description: "We've all heard how great the cloud is - but no one likes learning a new proprietary API if they don't need to. In this session, I'll demonstrate how you can develop, test and deploy ROR apps faster to HP's public cloud based on OpenStack technology. If you are new to the cloud or if you're just a CLI commando, I'll run through HP's Ruby CLI, spin up cloud servers and attach block storage faster than you thought possible. And, for Ruby Fog fans, I'll show you the HP Ruby Fog extensions that let you easily provision and manage cloud servers and storage using your favorite environment.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGaJ/"
