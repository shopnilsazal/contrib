description: "Andy Brody and James Punteney, U.S. Digital Service\n\nThe year is 1999, judging from the technology on your servers. Your mission is to ensure the next .gov website launches successfully using modern SRE tools and practices. Where do you start?\n\nIn this talk, U.S. Digital Service engineers will discuss lessons learned from helping teams at multiple government agencies adopt SRE tools and practices, changing the culture to emphasize launching fast and learning from mistakes in an environment where healthcare.gov-style disasters are commonplace.\n\nIn October 2017, the USDS helped launch a new Global Entry enrollment site built with modern technology. It uses Login.gov, a new service that provides a single, secure, and usable way to log in to multiple government websites.\n\nWe describe what it was like on launch day when we moved Global Entry from “cloud infrastructure” where it takes 6 months to provision a VM to an AWS infrastructure where deployments happen daily, and how we scaled Login.gov to meet the load.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
