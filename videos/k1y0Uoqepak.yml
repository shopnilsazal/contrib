description: "Distributed Database DevOps Dilemmas? Kubernetes to the Rescue - Denis Magda, GridGain\n\nDistributed databases can make so many things easier for a developer... but not always for DevOps.  OK, almost never for DevOps.  Kubernetes has come to the rescue with an easy application orchestration!  \n\nIt’s straightforward to do the orchestration leaning on relational databases as a data layer. However, it’s becoming a bit trickier to do the same when a distributed SQL database or other kind of distributed storage is used instead. \n\nIn this talk you will learn how Kubernetes can orchestrate distributed database like Apache Ignite, in particular: \nCluster Assembling - database nodes auto-discovery in Kubernetes.\nDatabase Resilience - automated horizontal scalability.\nDatabase Availability - what’s the role of Kubernetes and the database.\nUtilizing both RAM and disk - set up Apache Ignite in a way to get in-memory performance with durability of disk.\n\nAbout Denis Magda\nDenis Magda is a Director of Product Management at GridGain Systems and Apache Ignite PMC Chair. He is an expert in distributed systems and platforms. Before joining GridGain and becoming a part of Apache Ignite community, he worked for Oracle where he led the Java ME Embedded Porting Team -- helping Java open cross new boundaries by entering the IoT market."
