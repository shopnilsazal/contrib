description: "Async Web Apps with Sanic\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - Anfiteatro 1]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nThis talk will introduce you to Sanic, the Python 3 web framework that supports async request handlers with a simple, Flask-like, API.\n\nWe will start with a Sanic overview and compare it with other similar options before looking at the API and working through a basic app. Our goal here will be to get a feel for the Sanic API and demonstrate how it fits together. After this we will cover some of the more unique and interesting possibilities with Sanic, such as support for websockets and HTTP2.\n\nA web framework is often only as powerful as its ecosystem, so we will take a look at some of the popular Sanic extensions for databases, templating and testing.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
