description: "PyData London 2014\n\nDiamond Light Source is the UK Synchrotron, a national facility containing over 20 experimental stations or beamlines, many of which are capable of generating Terra-bytes of raw data every day. In this data rich environment, many scientists that come to the facility can be daunted by the sheer quantity and complexity of the data on offer. The scientific software group is charged with assisting with this deluge of data and as a small team it is imperative that provides sustainable and rapid solutions to problems. Python has proved to be well suited to this and is now used heavily at the facility, from cutting edge research projects, through general pipe-lining and data management, to simple data manipulation scripts. And by a range of staff and facility users, from experienced software engineers and scientists, to support staff and PhD students simply wanting something to help make sense of the data or experimental set-up.\n\nThis presentation focuses on the current state of the scientific management and data analysis within Diamond, and details the workhorses which are relied on, as well as what the future holds."
