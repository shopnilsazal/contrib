title: 'Accessing the Google Cloud Platform with C#  - Jon Skeet'
recordingDate: 1472470756
description: "The majority of my role within Google is to make the Google Cloud Platform easier to use for C# developers. If you feel friction when using our services, it's my job to make that friction go away. When you're writing your app, most of the time you don't care about the details of the RPC system, the serialization, or authentication - you just want simple access to machine learning, image recognition, fast storage and all the other cool things my colleagues build.\nIn this talk I'll share the challenges we've faced, the design decisions we've made and the consequences of them. How does code generation affect versioning? How can we provide fine-grained tuning where necessary, but a great out-of-the-box hassle-free experience? When is a higher level of abstraction worth manual coding, and when does simple augmentation make more sense?"
