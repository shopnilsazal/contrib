Since past one year, I have been working with the Fedora CommunityOperations team on community-oriented metrics and on improving contributorretention rates in Fedora. During this talk, I would like to share thefindings from my work.\n\nThis talk will discuss about the methods FOSS communities can adopt to improvecontributor retention rates. I will explain different community-orientedmetrics we use at Fedora to understand community health like contributorengagement metrics, contributor onboarding and retention rates etc. I willthen share some insights derived from finding common patterns in contributionactivity of long-term active contributors i.e. Are long-term activecontributors involved in many different areas of their projects? What are somegood measures to predict longetivity of contributors ? What is the magicelement X that makes people stay ? I will talk on how a community can applythe insights generated from these metrics to devise methods/guidelines toimprove contributor retention rates and how an individual interested incontributing can ensure their prolonged interest in the FOSSproject/organization.\n\nIn the end, I will also share my experience as a newcomer and contributor toCommunity Operations team of Fedora and have a brief QnA session about thesteps FOSS communities apart from Fedora are taking to improve theircontributor retention rates.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.119 (Moved from AW1.124)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 12:05:00"
