recordingDate: 1420487828
description: "Want to run Ubuntu on your OS/X or Windows machine? Recreate any production environment? Snapshots? All from the command line?\n\nVirtualization technology is beginning to revolutionize development practices, just as it did with server infrastructure and \"the cloud.\" Imagine developing within the comfort of your own machine, but having the code run on hardware and software which directly matches production. Modern virtualization technology along with tools like Vagrant not only make this possible, but fun and easy.\n\nIn this talk, I'll present the advantages of working in a virtualized development environment both from the standpoint of an individual developer and a corporation. Then, I'll move onto introducing Vagrant and how it enables developers to work in virtualized environments with minimal effort."
