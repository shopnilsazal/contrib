description: "Droidcon Paris 2014\nCédric Creusot & Jean-Loup Yu, Meetic\n\nMobile is becoming slowly but surely the future of our habits. European Leader of Dating website, Meetic is a pioneer in the French Web which is deeply transforming to adapt to new functions. One of the main painful issues that you can meet before releasing an app: is it ready to be released? Did we break a feature while building this new version? In short, do we have the right to launch the application ?\n\nThis is for this reason and their wish to tackle this painful issue that thet have worked on automatical functional tests for mobile applications and the tool Calaba.sh in particular. Why and how can we write high level automatical tests? What executive strategy can we opt for?\n\nIn this talk, Cédric and Jean-Loup will be answering these questions. They will give feedback on their experience and will show you how they integrated this tool to their development cycle."
