description: 'Itâ€™s no secret that trying to change corporate culture is hard. This is primarily due to the fact that large corporations are complex systems and fundamentally averse to change. This reluctance is rooted in a systematic misalignment of shared vision, shared values, and shared culture within the organization. This talk defines a new method of business transformation by illustrating how to effectively influence corporate cultures towards collective action. To achieve that end, we outline an iterative framework along three main vectors: assess the people and environment, craft a narrative, then utilize timing to deliver your message for maximum impact. If you have ever been frustrated by a lack of political will within your own organization, come and join us. You will learn how to become a change agent yourself, how to create other change agents, then finally how to transform your corporation into a change agent.'
