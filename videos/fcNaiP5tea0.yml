title: 'Rack Middleware as a General Purpose Abstraction by John Bender'
recordingDate: 1334925299
description: "We've all seen the monolithic Rails model, pages and pages of methods all dumped into one class. Inevitably someone starts moving things around just to feel better about the loc count without making any real difference. How can we reify actions on an object and simplify our classes?\n\nIn this talk we'll examine Rack middleware as a general purpose method of object composition, see examples of it at work in Vagrant, and use these ideas to simplify an existing application.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGkq/"
