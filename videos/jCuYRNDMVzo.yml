description: "Presentation slides: http://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/amanda-casari-senior-data-scientist-concur-at-mlconf-sea-52016\n\nScaling Data Science Products, Not Data Science Teams: Congratulations! Your data science feature works! Your metrics are outstanding. Your data scientists and engineers have created useful products for your customers with proven results. Now your product and marketing teams are ready to move into new markets. Your underlying population changes. The skewed statistics of your data shifts depending on the data center you analyze. Your product is now localized and your NLP methods must adjust for a greater range of languages. Your requirements have grown. Your team has not.\n\nHow do you scale success for global products in multiple data centers with small teams?\n\nThe Data Science team at Concurâ€™s work to grow our products into international markets has not required a global scaling of resources. This talk will share our lessons learned in creating modular, reusable data science products deployable to international, segregated data centers."
