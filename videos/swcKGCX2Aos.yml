description: "This week I attended a meetup and met some awesome people!\n\nI was fortunate enough to have six of these talented and creative people tell me what advice they would give themselves if they could go back in time to when they first started.\n\nI love the answers I got from them. I hope you do too!\n\nThanks to everyone who offered their ideas."
