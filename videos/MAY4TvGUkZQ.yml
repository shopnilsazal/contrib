description: "In this talk we'll build a custom visual programming language that compiles down to Elixir modules. The language will be focused on generating chatbots atop an XMPP server, but the concept more broadly involves building a Rules Engine that generates runtime-configurable output based on input documents. We'll define an Abstract Syntax Tree for a custom language, a compiler that translates that AST into Elixir modules, and a UI for building the AST directly (i.e. no parser - this is not a text-based language). We'll also walk through the supporting web application that handles storing the AST as it's built.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HOXS/"
