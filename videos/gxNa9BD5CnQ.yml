title: 'Tyler Reddy: Veni, Vidi, Voronoi; Attacking viruses using spherical Voronoi diagrams in Python'
recordingDate: 1444122450
description: "Roughly spherical objects are abundant and affect human lives every day--whether dealing with the surface of the earth or microscopic viruses that cause severe illness in humans. Spherical Voronoi diagrams can be used to gain insight into such spherical objects and the algorithms used have only recently been proposed. I will discuss an open source Python implementation and remaining challenges.\n\nFull details â€”\_http://london.pydata.org/schedule/presentation/11/"
