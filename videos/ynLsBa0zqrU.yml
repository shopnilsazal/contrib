description: "It's always inspiring to me to hear about how the technology stack I'm familiar with has been used to solve interesting problems; this is one of the extreme versions of that experience. Over the last few years, Rails has been used to solve several of the logistical pain points of the third largest fire service organization in the state of Missouri, and in this talk we're going to look at how it happened. Along the way we'll look at some of the challenges of working with such an out-of-the-ordinary organization and how Rails fit into addressing some fairly unique requirements and constraints. This is one Rails-in-the-wild case study that you won't want to pass up.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGaL/"
