UXkids will look at important aspects of designing digital products for children and give you an insight in their UX research with kids.\n \nIn our talk, we will look at very important aspects of designing digital products for children -  under 12 years of age, talk about the do's and don'ts of designing for children and share our experience and best practices for doing UX research with kids. In order to design truly big experiences for kids, we have to get them involved. Only together, we can make supported design decisions that will match the expectations our youngest users have towards digital products."
