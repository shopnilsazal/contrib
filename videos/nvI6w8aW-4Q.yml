title: '#HITB2016AMS D1T2 - Kernel Exploit Hunting And Mitigation - Broderick Aquilino and Wayne Low'
recordingDate: 1466484897
description: "In the era of cyberwarfare, it becomes a norm to see cyber criminals use multi-level attacks to penetrate a multi-layered protected network infrastructure. We often see APT attackers manipulate 0-day or N-day Windows kernel vulnerabilities in order to guarantee a successful full system compromise. It would be a surprise if we do not see Windows kernel exploit involved in such targeted attacks.\n\nIt is also worth noting that beside APT attackers, the botnet operators also seize the opportunity to integrate these publicly, or sometime undisclosed, kernel exploits in their piece of work. One notable example is the CVE-2015-0057 Win32k exploit seen integrated into Dyre, a notorious banking Trojan spreading in the wild. This was first spotted by F-Secure’s proprietary dynamic-analysis system in 20th April 2015 however no information was provided by F-Secure during that time. The exploit was also seen to be removed from newer version of Dyre distributed after late June 2015 since after the disclosure of FireEye. Apart from that, there are a lot more malware families manipulating kernel exploit, to name a few:\n\n• Turla\n• Necurs\n• Carperb/Rovnix\n• Evotoob\n• Discpy\n• Ramnit\n\nThis topic will focus on how to proactively discover the effective samples with kernel exploits, or potentially 0-day kernel exploits, through a dynamic-analysis system. This talk will also detail the analysis of some kernel exploit that could bypass kernel exploit detection and prevention methodology used in HIPS. At last, we will demo a prototype tool on how to mitigate this kernel exploit effectively.\n\n======\n\nHe has over 13 years experience in the information security industry, with focus on reverse engineering malware. His previous publications include analysis on the Flashback and BlackEnery malware families. He is currently with the team behind the F-Secure Online Scanner. Outside the realm of information security, he is an avid comic book fan and enjoys rhythm games.\n\n------\n\nFormerly Senior Malware Analyst at F-Secure where he mainly focused on performing in-depth malware analysis and working closely with F-Secure’s proprietary behavior-based DeepGuard Technology for over three years.\n\nIn 2015, he joined FortiGuard Singapore as a Security Researcher. Currently his main interest is performing exploit analysis and vulnerability research on Windows kernel and Microsoft Office. Over 7-year experience in information security industry, Wayne regularly contributes his research through blogs, presentations and whitepapers."
