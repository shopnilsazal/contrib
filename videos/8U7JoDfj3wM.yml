description: "One of the greatest challenges to developing an API is ensuring that your API lasts. After all, you don't want to have to release and manage multiple versions of your API just because you weren't expecting users to use it a certain way, or because you didn't anticipate far enough down the roadmap. In this session we'll talk about the challenge of API Longevity, as well as ways to increase your API lifecycle including having a proper mindset, careful design, agile user experience and prototyping, best design practices including hypermedia, and the challenge of maintaining persistence.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Fp8i/"
