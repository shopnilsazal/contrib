title: 'Does Pair Programming Have to Suck?'
recordingDate: 1347728967
description: 'On some teams pairing is the norm; developers enjoy the collaboration & experience enhanced productivity. Others, though, work on teams where pairing is shunned, avoided, or just faked. Why do some craftsmen thrive with pairing while others want nothing to do with it? Why does coach- enforced pairing turn into something dry, distracted, imbalanced & ineffective? Effective pairing can increase creativity, energy, speed & quality. What factors make that possible? Learn how to take action on your team to put an end to soul-sucking, miserable, fake pair programming, and begin teaching your team to collaborate effectively on code.'
