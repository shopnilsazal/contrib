description: "AppSec California 2015 - Day 1, Track 1, Slot 5\n\nTitle\n\nAPI = Authentication’s Poorly Implemented\n\nAbstract\n\nWho doesn’t love a robust, easy-to-use, well-documented API? The ability to plug right into an application, a service, an infrastructure, especially in a secure way, is a marvelous feeling. But, what about those mild (and not so mild) oversights? Implementation flaws? Security bugs? Legacy APIs being “integrated” with new, flashy RESTful APIs?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll highlight some real-world examples of web-related API security problems, notably surrounding authentication and authorization issues in targets ranging from a big online payment shop to an embedded device’s backend infrastructure (and a slew of things in between).\n\nBio\n\nZach Lanier is a Senior Research Scientist with Accuvant Labs, specializing in various bits of network, mobile, and application security. Prior to joining Accuvant, Zach most recently served as a Senior Security Researcher with Duo Security. He has spoken at a variety of security conferences, such as Black Hat, CanSecWest, INFILTRATE, ShmooCon, and SecTor, and is a co-author of the “Android Hackers’ Handbook” (Wiley, April 2014).\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
