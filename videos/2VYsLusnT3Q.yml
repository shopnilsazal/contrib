description: "By, Brian L Troutwine\nBuilding computer systems that are reliable is hard. The functional programming community has invested a lot of time and energy into up-front-correctness guarantees: types and the like. Unfortunately, absolutely correct software is time-consuming to write and expensive as a result. Fault-tolerant systems achieve system-total reliability by accepting that sub-components will fail and planning for that failure as a first-class concern of the system. As companies embrace the wave of \"as-a-service\" architectures, failure of sub-systems become a more pressing concern. Using examples from heavy industry, aeronautics and telecom systems, this talk will explore how you can design for fault-tolerance and how functional programming techniques get us most of the way there."
