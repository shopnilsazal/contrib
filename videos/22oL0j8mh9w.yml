description: "Panel: Ask Me Anything: Microservices and Service Mesh [B] - Moderated by Jason McGee, IBM\n\nHave you heard the buzz around microservices and containers lately? With containers becoming the new standard to building microservice based applications for production, users are leveraging the service mesh to solve common issues with routing, re-routing for graceful degradation as services fail, secure inter-service communication and rate limiting between services. Join us for a live interactive session where our panel of experts from IBM, Google, Envoy, Linkerd and RedHat will address your most challenging inquiries around microservice and service mesh!\n\nAbout Jason McGee\nJason McGee, IBM Fellow, is VP and CTO of Container and Microservice Tribe. Jason leads the technical strategy and architecture across all of IBM Cloud, with specific focus on core foundational cloud services, including containers, micro-services, continuous delivery and operational visibility services. Previously Jason has served as Chief Architect of PureApplication System from inception to a mature $100+ million product.'\n\nAbout Matt Klein\nMatt Klein is a software engineer at Lyft and the architect of Envoy. Matt has been working on operating systems, virtualization, distributed systems, networking, and making systems easy to operate for 15 years across a variety of companies. Some highlights include leading the development of Twitter’s C++ L7 edge proxy and working on high-performance computing and networking in Amazon’s EC2.\n\nAbout Sven Mawson\nGoogle: Sven Mawson (sven@google.com) Sven is a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google, and one of the founders of the open source Istio project.
