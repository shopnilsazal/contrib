description: "Speakers : Simona Cotin (Microsoft), Asim Hussain (Microsoft)\n\nGetting started with Angular is now easier than ever ... said no one ever. Yet with the right toolset we too can create magic. When I code with Angular I can deploy to Azure within minutes.\n\nWe'll go through a simple development to production workflow. First we code with a little help from the Angular CLI. Then we build for production - Webpack to the rescue. We then push our code to Github and deploy it on Node to Azure.\n\nMission accomplished, application is now up in the clouds."
