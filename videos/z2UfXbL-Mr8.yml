recordingDate: 1442840821
description: "Aaron Stannard\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/dotnetfringe/sdktrm/\nDistributed computing in .NET isn&#39;t something you often hear about, but it&#39;s becoming an increasingly important area for growing .NET businesses around the globe. And frankly it&#39;s an area where .NET has lagged behind other runtimes and platforms for years - but this is changing!\nIn this talk we&#39;re going to introduce .NET developers to the Actor model via the Akka.NET framework - and show them how they can leverage its application programming model to build distributed, fault-tolerant applications that run just as well in a single process as they do in a 1,000 node cluster."
