description: "By Brandon Hays\n\nYou just wanted to add some nice interactive functionality to your Rails app. But then one jQuery plugin turns to three, add a dash of statefulness, some error handling, and suddenly you can't sleep at night.\n\nWe'll walk through using Ember Components to test-drive a refactor until your front-end code is understandable, usable, and extensible. Armed with TDD and components, you can start to get excited, not exasperated, when asked to add advanced client-side interactions to your website.\n\nBrandon left the world of marketing to find that creating software made him happy. Brandon lives in Austin, TX, where he helps run The Frontside, a Rails and Ember.js consultancy. Brandon's lifelong mission is to hug every developer.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG04/"
