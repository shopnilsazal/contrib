description: "The modern JVMs and containers that make our lives easy as developers also make measuring performance bewilderingly hard. And unfortunately even when using well-known and well regarded tools, it is still all too easy to lie to ourselves about performance.\n\nIn this talk, we'll examine some common performance goals, how to measure for those goals, and ways those measurements can go wrong. In the process, you'll learn to think more critically about your application and your stack as a whole and whether your measurements truly mean what you think they mean."
