description: "Jennifer Granick, Kevin Bankston, Marcia Hofmann, Kurt Opsahl - The Law of Laptop Search and Seizure\nThis talk will teach attendees about their legal rights in information stored on their laptops, including when crossing the United States border. We will answer questions such as: What do the police need to do to seize your laptop? Can the U.S. government force you to turn over your password during a border search? Do you have constitutional rights in email and other data stored in the cloud? What happens when the government attempts to force disclosure of passwords? Finally, we will give attendees practical advice on when to do when the police want to take their computers and how to secure device-accessible information, whether on the hard drive or stored remotely.\n\nJennifer Granick is the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
