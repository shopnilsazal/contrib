description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #13\n29 April 2018\nSponsored by JP Morgan and Hosted by Google Campus\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nA few months ago I presented Xcluster - a technique for clustering of machine generated emails and we focused on the classification use case (youtube.com/watch?v=O-B3aH_1Bc0).\nWell, now that we have those classified clusters, what else can we gain from it?\nIn this follow-up talk I will present our solution to the Mail extraction task, whose objective is to extract valuable data from the content of mail messages.\nThis task is key for many types of applications including re-targeting, mail search, and mail summarization, which utilize the important personal data pieces in mail messages to achieve their objectives.\nThe heart of our solution is an offline process that leverages the structural mail-specific characteristics of the clustering, and automatically creates extraction rules that are later applied online for each new arriving message.\nThis process has been productized in Yahoo mail backend and has been tested in large-scale experiments carried over real Yahoo mail traffic.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
