recordingDate: 1427643509
description: "by Michael Ries\nRails gives us great conventions for building an application, but what conventions should we use when we are building a whole system that encompasses multiple applications? How should we name things? What abstraction layers should we enforce?\nThe MX team has been building a distributed system composed of Rails applications for the last 3 years. Weâ€™ll talk about failed ideas, conventions that have stood the test of time and some experiments that are underway.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GVgq/"
