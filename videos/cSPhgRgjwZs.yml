description: "RubyConf 2016 - Rhythmic Recursion by Celeen Rusk\n\nOne of the best things about multi-disciplinary work is recognizing familiar ideas in a different setting. It’s like running into an old friend while you’re on vacation halfway around the world-- “I had no idea you’d be here! It’s so great to see you!”\n\nIn this talk we’ll run into our old friend recursion in the faraway land of minimalist music, by rewriting a piece of rhythmic music in Ruby."
