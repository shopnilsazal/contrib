title: 'CNCF Storage WG 07/18/2017'

description: 'The CNCF Storage WG meets bi-monthly to explore cloud native storage technology and concepts. Its current initiative is a project that aims to define an industry standard “container storage interface” (CSI). This interface would enable storage vendors to write a driver once and have it work across a number of container orchestration (CO) systems. This video is the WG July 18th meeting where the group discussed ROOK and received a demo of the technology.'
