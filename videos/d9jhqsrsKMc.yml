description: "by Christophe Van Ginneken\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce UmlCanvas in all its appearances: a Javascript library, a hosting service and soon a collaborative platform enabling \"Social Modeling\". We will illustrate what is possible with the current release and what we're up to in the near future. The talk will give the audience enough information for them to understand the UmlCanvas concepts, go to the UmlCanvas website and start creating online embeddable diagrams right away. \r\n\r\nUmlCanvas is a Javascript library that turns an HTML5 Canvas element into a dynamic and interactive UML diagram editor and presentation tool ... on every HTML page, on and off the web. UmlCanvas also offers a hosting service that puts your diagrams online. Design your diagram once, include it in many HTML-based formats: your own pages, your blog, feed readers and even Google Wave. Integrating CASE tools and hosted UmlCanvas, creates a collaborative platform that enable modelers to step out of the closed environment of their desktops and extend their modeling into the social web. \r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nâ—¦http://umlcanvas.org \r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development.
