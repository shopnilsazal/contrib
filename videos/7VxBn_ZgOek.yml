In that video, the automated verification system was a very abstract thing - today, we are going to get down and dirty and really look at what an automated verification system looks like in real life. There are many different tools that you can use to set up an automated verification system - in this video we are going to use CircleCI, partly because they are the sponsors of this video, but more importantly because they have been my personal favorite CI solution for the last year. In this video weâ€™re going to create a new web application, push it to github, add CircleCI to the project, and watch CircleCI build and test our project on each merge."
