description: "By Mattias 'tias' Guns, Mark Van den Borre and Christophe Vandeplas\r\n\r\nFOSDEM was started under the name OSDEM (Open Source Developers of Europe Meeting) by Raphael Bauduin. Raphael says that, since he felt he lacked the brains to properly contribute to the open source community, he wanted to contribute by launching a European event in Brussels. It was an immediate success, with speakers coming from all over.\r\n\r\nThe FOSDEM conference is coming to its tenth birthday. We will quickly go over the history and present.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
