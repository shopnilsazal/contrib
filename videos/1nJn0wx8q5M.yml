description: 'Probably there is no Java developer in the world who writes tests and haven''t heard about Mockito. That most popular mocking framework for Java will be celebrating its 10th birthday soon. However, I don''t plan to brood the history. At the end of 2016 the new and shiny Mockito 2 has been released. During the presentation I will show what brand new features have been implemented in Mockito 2 and what improvements you can expect. We will also take a closer look at the places which changed incompatibly and possible migration pitfalls. You will be able to judge if it was worth to wait almost 2 years since Mockito 1.10.19.'
