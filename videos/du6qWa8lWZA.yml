recordingDate: 1463487797
description: 'Robert Virding is one of the co-inventors of Erlang and was an early member of the Ericsson Computer Science Lab. He took part in the original system design and contributed much of the original libraries, as well as to the current compiler. He has always been interested in language design and implementation and while at the lab he also did a lot of work on the implementation of functional and logic languages and on garbage collection. More recently he has done a number of implementations of different languages in Erlang and used on the Erlang system which have been spread and used externally.'
