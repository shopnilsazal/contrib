description: "It's 5am and a multi-million dollar process fails halfway through. Hours of nightmarish, manual brain surgery later, enough is enough.\n\nWhat happens when background jobs grow as bloated as the MonoRailâ„¢ that begot them?\n\nRather than reach for the latest fad off of HackerNews, we'll user Ruby and Rails to automate error-recovery, concurrent processing, and catch corrupt data before it brings everything down.\n\nTypist, Philosopher at ZenPayroll. Humanist with a penchant for dystopian novels, St. George gin enthusiast, and wearer of colorful pants.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1u/"
