description: "Yet another episode MOSTLY NOT ACCOMPLISHING MUCH! Real-world development for you. Deploying our first version of the prototype to the internet using Heroku.\n\nYou'll learn about:\nâ™¥ Heroku and deployment\nâ™¥ Different git remotes (GitHub and Heroku)\nâ™¥ The pain when GitHub is not online, but how it is OK because git is decentralized\n\nHere's where we'll end up in the code:\nðŸ”— https://github.com/mpj/better-playlists/tree/2ec06ba2f5be4f3b1bf0eaf90d6247c6be4220f3\n\nAnd the actual app\nðŸ”— http://better-playlists.herokuapp.com\n\nLike this pair-programming format?\nâ–º MPJ and David waiting for deployment scripts on Fun Fun Function\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFO1cRr5-qY\n\n- - -\n\nIn this series we'll go from start to finish in building a fully functioning high-fidelity prototype with OAuth2 authentication and API connections fetching real data. The user will experience the prototype with her own stuff in it!\n\nWe do this by using React JS https://reactjs.org/ - a great JavaScript framework for building front-end components. We will even do some back-end to handle authentication eventually.\n\nAnd yes, this is not Travis - David and MPJ are filling in!\n\n- - -\n\nThis video was sponsored by the DevTips Patron Community - https://www.patreon.com/DevTips\n\nListen to Travis' Podcast - http://www.travandlos.com/\n\nGet awesomeness emailed to you every thursday - http://travisneilson.com/notes \n\nYou should follow DevTips on Twitter - https://twitter.com/DevTipsShow\n\nMPJ's channel on programming Fun Fun Function is great  - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/funfunfunction\n\nDavid is known as Data David discussing analytics and data - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0TQC6ZPNm23dU6ecc5x0Gg"
