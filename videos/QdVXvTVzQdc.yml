description: "Continuous Localisation using FOSS tools Building a fast responsive localisation process using open source tools\nby Dwayne Bailey\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nContinuous integration brought us fast reliable and continuous testing.Continuous localisation brings the same speed and delivery to the translationof software. We'll look at how to build such a process using FOSS tools.\n\nContinuous localisation is becoming more critical to the software deliveryprocess. And just like continuous inegration we rely on a number of tools andautomation to ensure that we deliver good translations quickly to products.\n\nWe'll be looking at continuous localisation processes using FOSS tools andmapping the parallels between modern software development and continuouslocalisation.\n\nWe'll cover aspects such as:\n\n  * Testing/Checking and building automated linguistic and stylistic checks  * Automated and bidirectional synchronisation between the translation tools and software repos  * Building in processes for content review both in source and target text  * Encouraging translator participation  * Delivering translations quickly and continuously\n\nAnd for FOSS projects we'll show how to implement a process using FOSS tools.\n\n\nRoom: K.1.105 (La Fontaine)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 15:00:00"
