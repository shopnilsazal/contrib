recordingDate: 1432920461
description: "By Kitty Stryker\n\nSocial media proficiency is considered highly important for any business. But when you're in the sex industry, whether it be as a porn performer, an escort, an adult studio or a sex toy company, it can be incredibly difficult to maneuver constantly changing rules. Real name policies, payment processors, and shifting, vague content restrictions can cost a sex worker all of their fans and marketing work, as well as their safety. Kitty Stryker discusses the tension between sex work as a tech-using business, and sex work's social stigma."
