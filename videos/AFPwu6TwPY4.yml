recordingDate: 1473199813
description: "Containerizing PostgreSQL and Making it Cloud Native Ready\n\nIn this presentation, I'll show how I leveraged open source cloud technologies like Kubernetes (Openshift) and Prometheus to provide a set of data services around the PostgreSQL database. The Crunchy Containers provides not only a means to run PostgreSQL database clusters but also to administer and monitor them. This basic set of features could apply to any database as well. The design of these containers will be discussed as well as lessons learned along the way."
