description: "RailsConf 2017: The Art & Craft of Secrets: Using the Cryptographic Toolbox by Michael  Swieton\n\nPicking an encryption algorithm is like choosing a lock for your door. Some are better than others - but there's more to keeping burglars out of your house (or web site) than just the door lock. This talk will review what the crypto tools are and how they fit together with our frameworks to provide trust and privacy for our applications. We'll look under the hood of websites like Facebook, at game-changing exploits like Firesheep, and at how tools from our application layer (Rails,) our protocol layer (HTTP,) and our transport layer (TLS) combine build user-visible features like single sign-on."
