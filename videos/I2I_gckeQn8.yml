recordingDate: 1529927092
description: "Jamie discusses why Outlier Ventures invest and partner with the communities that will create this new equitable economy, driving the mass decentralisation of the web and challenging the existential threats from evolving data monopolies.\n\nThe talk also looks at the growing competition with the current enterprise leaders in the space and the parallel innovation in governments, exemplified in China and India. Finally, there is an assessment of what more still needs to be done holistically, to move away from proprietary models and enable anyone, anywhere, to birth a digital economy and program it with game theory, changing the rules of the game.\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018.
