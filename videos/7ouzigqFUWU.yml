description: "Docker is all the rage these days. Everyone is talking about it and investing in it, from startups to enterprises and everything in between. But is it secure? What are the costs and benefits of using it? Is this just a huge risk or a huge opportunity? There's a while lot of ranting and raving going on, but not nearly enough rational discourse. I'll cover the risks and rewards of using Docker and similar technologies such as AppC as well as discuss the larger implications of using orchestration systems like Mesos or Kubernetes. This talk will cover the deep technical issues to be concerned about as well as the pragmatic realities of the real world.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDavid Mortman is the Chief Security Architect and Distinguished Engineer at Dell Software and is a Contributing Analyst at Securosis.
