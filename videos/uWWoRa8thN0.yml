description: "Martin Schweitzer\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/89/view_talk\nIn this talk I will explain why Python is an excellent language for learning about bioinformatics.  I intend to make a compelling case in favour of using Python as a first language for teaching bioinformatics. \r\n\r\nI will then explain how bioinformatics can be a useful vehicle for learning Python.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will visit a site where users can learn both Python and bioinformatics in a stimulating, engaging and motivating environment.\r\n\r\nThe talk will assume familiarity with Python, but does not assume any knowledge of bioinformatics."
