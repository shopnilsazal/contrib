description: "Plants are Recursive!!: Using L-Systems to Generate Realistic Weeds By Sher Minn Chong\n\nPlants and programming are more related than you might realize! Trees, shrubs and weeds may look complex, but with the magic of recursion, we can describe them with just a few simple rules.\n\nWe'll explore how we can use the recursive nature of L-Systems to create complex and natural-looking plants. And why stop at plants? We'll also see how L-Systems can be used to describe some of our favourite fractals such as Sierpinski's triangle and the Dragon curve, and how they can be used to create art.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/KEUp/"
