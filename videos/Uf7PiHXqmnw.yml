description: "Keynote: Distributed Systems Simplified Using Kubernetes - Brandon Philips, CTO, CoreOS\n\nUnderstand how to better control clusters with etcd, a cornerstone of a variety of systems and the Kubernetesâ€™s default storage backend. It simplifies Kubernetes cluster availability by handling reliable state management. See how etcd stores and replicates data across the entire cluster, and can recover from hardware failure and network partitions.\n\nAbout Brandon Philips\nBrandon Philips is helping to build modern Linux server infrastructure at CoreOS as CTO. Prior to CoreOS, he worked at Rackspace hacking on cloud monitoring and was a Linux kernel developer at SUSE. As a graduate of Oregon State's Open Source Lab he is passionate about open source technologies."
