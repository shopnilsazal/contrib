I will show how, by working on the root causes of the issues weface, we can be successful in creating better spaces for everyone toparticipate.\n\nWe often think about our Free and Libre Open Source communities as being builton egalitarian principles of meritocracy and do-ocracy: anyone with the willand the skills can be involved and have their work recognized.\n\nHowever, without awareness of how power is distributed and how socialinteractions take place, those communities are very likely to reproducepatterns leading to excluding people. Even when we are aware of the need andbenefits of building better and safer spaces for everyone, implementations arenot that easy and one might despair of not being successful.\n\nIn this talk, I will present some key principles learned from my experience toshow how, by working on the root causes of the issues we face, we can besuccessful in creating better spaces for everyone to participate: what powerpatterns are involved in our social interactions; what can go wrong with thepolitics of “Inclusion and Diversity”; how we can concretely improve ourpersonal and collective practices for a better good.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.119 (Moved from AW1.124)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 15:30:00"
