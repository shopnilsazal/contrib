description: "AsyncIO is a new standard library module in 3.4 for writing concurrent applications. While it is easy to see how this would be useful for writing a webserver there are other less obvious opportunities to use this with your code\n\nThis talk is about one such non obvious use case and the leasons learnt while converting this code and other code bases to work with AsyncIO\n\nThis focus will not be on getting new users up to speed on AsyncIO but is intended more as a collection of 'here be dragons' advice, things noted and patterns seen while developing for AsyncIO and is intended to help those familiar with the basic concepts avoid some pitfalls that they may encounter.\n\nYou should come away from this talk with a clearer idea of how you should and should not be writing things with AsyncIO and some inspiration for applying AsyncIO to your own projects\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nAugust 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
