description: "Workshop is led by our guest from Tel-Aviv, Yaniv Efraim, Tech Lead @ Wix’s Frontend Infra Team.\n\nAlways wanted to do TDD within your React application? Tired of boring TDD examples? No more excuses! In this workshop, you will learn (and practice) how to write TDD in real world applications. We will write a game, TDD style, learning about best practices and tooling (Selenium, Mocha, Enzyme and much more). We will start the day with a few hours of live coding session, and continue with a hands on workshop"
