title: 'Continuous Delivery with Kubernetes at Box [I] - Greg Lyons, Box'
recordingDate: 1513363503
description: "Continuous Delivery with Kubernetes at Box [I] - Greg Lyons, Box\n\nDeploying and managing applications with Kubernetes can be challenging. Organizing configuration across multiple environments, rolling out changes incrementally, safely killing or rolling back failed deployments - these are just a few difficulties that organizations face when running containers in production.\n\nAt Box, we've dealt with these issues and more, at the scale of thousands of servers across multiple data centers and public cloud providers. In this talk, we'll share how we set up a continuous delivery pipeline with Jenkins, Docker, Artifactory, and Kubernetes to test, build, and release our software rapidly and reliably. We'll discuss how our pipeline reduces time to ship to production, provides greater visibility into the deployment process, and empowers our engineers to deploy quality code with confidence.\n\nAbout Greg Lyons\nGreg is a software engineer at Box, where he works on tooling for running microservices with Kubernetes. He built and open-sourced kube-applier, a containerized service for deploying Kubernetes apps with declarative configuration."
