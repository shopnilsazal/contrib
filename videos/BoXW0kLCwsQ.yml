description: "View slideshare presentation here:\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/PyData/daniel-krasner-high-performance-text-processing-with-rosetta\n\nPyData NYC 2014\nThis talk covers rapid prototyping of a high performance scalable text processing pipeline development in Python. We demonstrate how Python modules, in particular from the Rosetta library, can be used to analyze, clean, extract features, and finally perform machine learning tasks such as classification or topic modeling on millions of documents. Our style is to build small and simple modules (each with command line interfaces) that use very little memory and are parallelized with the multiprocessing library."
