title: 'jQuery Conf SF 2012 Grow Up With Grunt by Ben Alman'
recordingDate: 1345932640
description: 'During this talk, Ben Alman will demonstrate how you can use grunt, the task-based JavaScript build tool, to improve your development process through automation. Maybe you want to more easily employ popular, best-practice approaches to JavaScript and jQuery development like linting your code, writing and running unit tests, and concatenating or minifying files, but haven''t quite figured out how to incorporate them into your application. Perhaps you just want to write a jQuery plugin, and don''t want to spend a lot of time setting up project scaffolding. Either way, by the end of this talk, you''ll have a much better grasp on what this tool can help you do!'
