description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nBuilding Event-Driven Pipelines with Brigade - Brian Redmond, Microsoft (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nBuilding complex or even simple event-driven pipelines on Kubernetes has always been somewhat of an elusive task, until now. Enter Brigade, a lightweight opensource event-driven tool that accepts a Javascript expression of a pipeline that gets seamlessly converted into the associated Kubernetes runtime objects. In this session we will build a pipeline from the ground up, hands on, to demonstrate just how simple to solve sometimes complex tasks with Brigade.\n\nAbout Brian\nBrian Redmond is an Cloud Architect on the Azure Global Black Belt team at Microsoft. Brian focuses on containers, microservices, DevOps, and cloud native applications in the Azure cloud platform. Brian has been working in technology for over 20 years and has a mixed background across application development to infrastructure. Brian is based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA and enjoys running, biking, and tinkering with new technology. I spoke at KubeCon 2017 in Austin to a large room and got some really positive feedback. Looking forward to an opportunity to speak at KubeCon in Copenhagen and possibly events in Japan and China in 2018."
