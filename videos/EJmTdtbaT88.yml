description: "Names matter and we should stop it with the DevSecOps, SecDevOps labels. In this talk we'll discuss some simple linguistic theory on the hidden baggage that names and metaphors can carry, how we can use this to our advantage when modifying processes and organizational interactions to improve security posture, and how some of the key terms around DevOps such as 'infrastructure-as-code' were successful at least partially due to positive baggage and implications around their names.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
