recordingDate: 1392711145
description: "Mystic - Mimicry\nMimicry\n\nMimicry is the ability to survive by mimicking your surroundings. In 1996 a book named Disappearing Cryptography by Peter Wayner was published and with it proof of concept code called the mimic functions that allow for encrypted data to be hidden in innocent looking text. This allows for encrypted data to be passed through networks undetected by filters looking for anything out of the ordinary. This talk will include an introduction to how the mimic functions do what they do and will also be an introduction to a tool called ircMimic that uses the mimic functions to hide data in an IRC conversation.\n\nMystic is a poetic coder and a self described \"creative hacker\"."
