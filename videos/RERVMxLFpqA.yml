description: "Carol Willing | Saturday 12:00 | Assembly Room\n\nThis is a panel of four experts answering pre-submitted questions from the assembled audience under the guidance of a chairperson. Audience participation will be encouraged.\n\nFake news on social media, dragnet collection of personal data, being asked to write code for the benefit of your employers but that's not necessarily helpful for your users, using big data to analyse the behaviour of users, government control of the internet, violations of FLOSS licenced code. These subjects and more like them are ripe for discussion in this panel.\n\nThink \"Question Time\" on BBC1 at 10:30pm on a Thursday and you have a pretty good idea of what it will be like.\n\nCAROL WILLING (CHAIR)\nCarol Willing\n\nCarol Willing is a Python Software Foundation Fellow and former Director, a core developer for CPython and Project Jupyter, and a Research Software Engineer at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.\n\nShe's also Geek-In-Residence at Fab Lab San Diego and co-organizes PyLadies San Diego and San Diego Python.
