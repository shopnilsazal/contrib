Beyond the scope of features and functionality, there are a lot of things to consider related to working with a vendor, like customer support, pricing, scalability, flexibility, roadmap, track record, and real-world proving of their capabilities. There are things that may matter to you and some that don't. Let's dive into how a bad selection could be costly.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
