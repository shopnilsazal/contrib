description: "Dougal Matthews - Effective Code Review\n[EuroPython 2016]\n[19 July 2016]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/effective-code-review)\n\nDevelopers usually state that finding defects is the primary\nmotivation for doing code reviews. However, research has shown that\nthe main benefits of code reviews are; knowledge transfer, team\nawareness and finding alternative solutions.\n\nCode reviews when done well are more than just finding defects; it\nshould be a discussion and conversation with other developers about\nfinding the best solutions. We will talk about re-framing code review\nto encourage open discussions.\n\n-----\n\nThis talk is for everyone that is already involved in regular code\nreview and those hoping to start. I will talk through the code review\nprocess with the aim of making it a better and more useful experience\nfor both the authors and the reviewers.\n\nThe talk will follow the following rough outline:\n\n- Introduction\n  - Why do code reviews\n  - What are we aiming to get out of it\n- Submitting code for review\n  - How can you help reviewers?\n  - What should you avoid doing?\n  - Removing ownership of the code\n- Reviewing code\n  - How should you give feedback?\n  - What should you look for?\n  - How can you encourage people to review more?\n  - How to avoid and remove bike-shedding\n- Code review tools and how they impact on the process.\n- Wrap up and conclusion"
