description: "by Guillaume Plique\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nWhile a lot of languages already have comprehensive libraries to handle graphdata (like [networkx](http://networkx.github.io/) in python), the same cannotbe said for JavaScript.\n\nThis talk discusses how we were driven to create a multipurpose graph objectspecification for JavaScript and what were the design issues we soon had totackle from implementation choices to API naming.\n\nThe result of this work is the [graphology](https://graphology.github.io/)specification & reference implementation which we present to open it tofeedbacks & contributions.\n\n* * *\n\nWe will first review the state of the art of graph libraries for JavaScriptand discuss the issues which brought us to create a new projet from scratch.\n\nThen we will explain why we chose to design an open specification for astandard API rather than only providing a library.\n\nFinally we will present the reference implementation & the attached library ofalgorithms and justify the technical choices made, before presenting ourfuture roadmap and related projects (a new version of the graph renderinglibrary, [sigma.js](http://sigmajs.org/), notably).\n\n* * *\n\n_Alexis Jacomy_\n\nAlexis is CTO of Matlo, a data discovery web app. He spent last years workingon tools to help people explore data. He also develops multiple JavaScripttools with Guillaume Plique, notably sigma.js to visualize networks in webpages.\n\nhttps://github.com/jacomyal\n\n_Guillaume Plique_\n\nGuillaume Plique is a developer at SciencesPo's m√©dialab working on a varietyof Open Source projects in JavaScript, Clojure & Python. He specializes indeveloping software for social sciences researchers and often works withgraphs, natural language processing and UIs.\n\nhttps://github.com/Yomguithereal\n\n\nRoom: H.2214\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 14:10:00"
