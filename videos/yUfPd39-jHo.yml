description: "Don’t Hassle Me, I’m Stateful - Jeff Bornemann & Michael Surbey, Red Hat\n\nStateless, cloud-ready applications are the future for many enterprise users, but what do you do about legacy monoliths, and existing vendor applications? New StatefulSet features within Kubernetes allow developers and administrators to work with these types of applications, and still reap the many rewards of a containerized platform. This session will explore some of these features by deploying a full MongoDB cluster on-top of OpenShift.\n\nAbout Jeff Bornemann\nJeff has been developing software for Fortune 500 companies for many years, including contributions to multiple OSS projects. Jeff works with Red Hat's OpenShift platform, helping to bring container adoption to Red Hat customers.\n\nAbout Michael Surbey\nWith a background in development, design, and management of enterprise IT-driven solutions, Mike enjoys helping U.S. public sector customers, contributors, and partners create better a citizen experience the open source way."
