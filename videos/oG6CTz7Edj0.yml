description: "by Bernard Tyers\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nGetting HCI MSc students involved in open source software!\n\nWhats not to like!\n\nI've had agreement from a university in London to propose a number open sourcesoftware projects to a HCI masters programme for studnets to carry outusability evaluations as part of their MSc in HCI programme.\n\nI would like to do a short 10 maybe 15 mins proposal to members of establishedopen source projects which would be able to take the feedback from \"the top2%\" of student evaluations and incorporate them into their software.\n\nI would outline what the criteria for the projects would be (still to bedecided), and also what the students would do for the project and how theywould send the recommendations to them.\n\nEssentially, it's a gathering of interest exercise. It'll be super quick.Please accept me!\n\nI'd be happy to do this at the end of the day combined with something else ifnecessary.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 11:20:00"
