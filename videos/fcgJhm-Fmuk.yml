title: 'DEF CON 19 - Reeves Smith - How Haunters Void Warranties'
recordingDate: 1383370009
description: "Halloween makers or how haunters void warranties, social engineer and find the joy of creativity. A short path down to what a community of makers that mod hardware, special effect and mood you in order to scare the shit out of you just one night a year. These people comprise electrical engineers to housewives and personally I've learned to solder better, faster because of it.\n\nReeves Smith has been working with hardware for security's sake for 12 years, making open source WIDS and the like. He found a community of makers that live for nothing but Halloween and thought their spirit of creativity was a lot like the creativity seen in parts of the security community. He currently works for Tenacity Solutions Inc. as a SNSE and is a Mac Fan Boy.\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=571239063"
