title: 'AppSec EU 2017 Security In The Land Of Microservices by Jack Mannino'
language: English

description: "Microservices offer a lot of benefits for deploying large-scale applications, but they introduce their own unique security challenges. Services are highly decoupled from each other as well as producers and consumers of data moving throughout the architecture. You support web users, mobile users, IoT device users, and a few people that still use flip phones and your old dusty legacy services.\n\nIn this presentation, we will discuss the challenges with securing microservices. Using real-world examples of successes and failures while building microservices, we will discuss what translates well from monolithic design. Securely sharing secrets between services is important, and we'll examine open source and AWS related tools to achieve this. We will demonstrate how to build authentication into a microservice architecture using the API Gateway Pattern. At the end of this presentation, you'll understand how to chase your tail less as you migrate to this great new world of tiny services.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
