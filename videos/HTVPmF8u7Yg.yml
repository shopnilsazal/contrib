description: "What do the Dallas tornado siren attack, hacked electric skateboards, and insecure smart door locks have in common? Vulnerable wireless protocols. Exploitation of wireless devices is growing increasingly common, thanks to the proliferation of radio frequency protocols driven by mobile and IoT. While non-Wi-Fi and non-Bluetooth RF protocols remain a mystery to many security practitioners, exploiting them is easier than one might think.\n\nJoin us as we walk through the fundamentals of radio exploitation. After introducing essential RF concepts and characteristics, we will develop a wireless threat taxonomy by analyzing and classifying different methods of attack. As we introduce each new attack, we will draw parallels to similar wired network exploits, and highlight attack primitives that are unique to RF. To illustrate these concepts, we will show each attack in practice with a series of live demos built on software-defined and hardware radios.\n\nAttendees will come away from this session with an understanding of the mechanics of wireless network exploitation, and an awareness of how they can bridge their IP network exploitation skills to the wireless domain."
