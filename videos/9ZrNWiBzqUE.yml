title: 'DEF CON 24 - Allan Cecil - Robot Hacks: TASBot Exploits Consoles with Custom Controllers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1479078441
description: "TASBot is an augmented Nintendo R.O.B. robot that can play video games without any of the button mashing limitations us humans have. By pretending to be a controller connected to a game console, TASBot triggers glitches and exploits weaknesses to execute arbitrary opcodes and rewrite games. This talk will cover how these exploits were found and will explore the idea that breaking video games using Tool-Assisted emulators can be a fun way to learn the basics of discovering security vulnerabilities. After a brief overview of video game emulators and the tools they offer, I’ll show a live demo of how the high accuracy of these emulators makes it possible to create a frame-by-frame sequence of button presses accurate enough to produce the same results even on real hardware. After demonstrating beating a game quickly I’ll show how the same tools can be used to find exploitable weaknesses in a game’s code that can be used to trigger an Arbitrary Code Execution, ultimately treating the combination of buttons being pressed as opcodes. Using this ability, I’ll execute a payload that will connect a console directly to the internet and will allow the audience to interact with it. An overview of some of the details that will be described in the talk can be found in an article I coauthored for the PoC||GTFO journal (Pokemon Plays Twitch, page 6 ).\n\nBio:\nAllan Cecil (dwangoAC) is the President of theNorth Bay Linux User’s Group. He acts as an ambassador for Tasvideos.org, a website devoted to using emulators to complete video games as quickly as the hardware allows. He participates in Games Done Quick charity speed running marathons using TASBot to entertain viewers with never-before-seen glitches in games. By day, he is a senior engineer at Ciena Corporation working on OpenStack Network Functions Virtualization orchestration and Linux packet performance optimization testing."
