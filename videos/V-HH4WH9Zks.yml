description: "Nina Mushiana, LinkedIn\n\nOne of the Linkedinâ€™s key cultural values is Career Transformation: Helping people you manage build new abilities and skills, work with them to define their career goals and support their efforts to accomplish them. Applying this to a Tier1 support team is challenging.\n\nA Tier1 support manages the day-to-day operations of your business and engages higher tiers when needed. They end up with a very wide field of view but very little depth of knowledge. They are always the bearers of bad news and only noticed when something is broken. The morale of such teams is notoriously low. Furthermore, capitalizing on this experience for the business is a challenge because of retention issues stemming from low morale. This was LinkedIn in 2013."
