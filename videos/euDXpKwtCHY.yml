recordingDate: 1385599407
description: "by Mando Escamilla\n\nThe software development world is a twisty maze of passages, all alike (at first glance). It can be slightly perilous and a little scary, especially if you're just starting out.\n\nHow should you know what job to take? Or what salary to accept? And if you've been doing this a while, how do you manage the day-to-day challenges of work? How do you know what positions or promotions to accept or decline?\n\nDuring this talk we'll examine the 16 year career of a software developer, namely me. We'll review my personal and professional choices and see how they impacted my life and career, and, hopefully, learn from my mistakes.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG5q/"
