description: "by Conrad Bebbington\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nNote: here AES refers to the Audio Engineering Society, not the AdvancedEncryption Standard. The growing field of pro-audio networking has recentlyseen demand for movement away from proprietary technologies towards openstandards. AES70 has emerged as a means to control audio devices over thenetwork. This talk covers the motivations driving the standardization effortsand the basic details of the standard itself.\n\nOver the past decade, the use of IP networks for pro-audio has seensignificant growth. These networks incorporate many types of audio devices,from input amplifiers to full mixing desks. Recently, there has been interestin moving to an open standard to control these devices. This has resulted inthe AES70 standard which addresses device control with a focus on audiospecific controls.\n\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 15:00:00"
