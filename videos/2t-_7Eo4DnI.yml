title: 'Burlington Ruby Conf 2013 Building Ambitious APIs with Ruby by Dan Gebhardt'
recordingDate: 1378911647
description: "With the advent of native and single page web apps, APIs are more important than ever. An application's API often must serve the needs of its own front end(s) as well as any third party applications and scripts that integrate with it. It should be flexible, yet follow strong conventions to be easily understood.\n\nThis talk will discuss strategies for building an ambitious API with Ruby. It will cover diverse topics such as authentication, versioning, side-loading and embedding related data, bulk access, and more.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8K/"
