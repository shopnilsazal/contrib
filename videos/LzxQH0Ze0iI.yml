description: "PyData New York City 2017\n\nSlides: g.co/earth/PyDataNYC2017\n\nSatellites have been observing the Earth for over 40 years, generating petabytes of geospatial observations. Analysis of these data can be complex, and there is a need for reproducible workflows for developing, sharing, and improving upon existing geospatial analysis. In this session we will present a system for presenting such an analysis, using Jupyter, IPyLeafet, and Google Earth Engine."
