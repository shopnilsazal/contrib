language: English
recordingDate: 1497561677
description: "Gerry Millar, Atlassian\n\nWhen an incident happens it's the worst possible time to be bogged down with confusing systems and processes. A well defined Incident Management Process that's light-weight and supported by good automation offers a way to get fast, easy and predictable results during an incident, but if you don't implement the right things in the right way you risk bad results, such as high time-to-recovery, at critical times.\n\nFind out how Atlassian drives value out of the Incident Management process and what metrics we use to track it. We'll also cover how we created automation to remove the overhead in managing incidents and deep dive into a case study to explain how it all ties together.\n\nThe target audience for this conceptual session is people who are involved in the management of incidents, such as SREs and delivery team members.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
