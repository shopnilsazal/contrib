title: 'Peadar Coyle: Probabilistic programming in sports analytics'
recordingDate: 1444123730
description: "A discussion and tutorial of how to use pymc to predict rugby results. Also will include an introduction to Bayesian statistics. \n\nProbabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods are called by some a new paradigm. There are numerous interesting applications such as to Quantitative Finance.I'll discuss what probabilistic programming is, why should you care and how to use PyMC and PyMC3 from Python to implement these methods. I'll be applying these methods to studying the problem of 'rugby sports analytics' particularly how to model the winning team in the recent Six Nations in Rugby. I will discuss the framework and how I was able to quickly and easily produce an innovative and powerful model as a non-expert.\n\nPeadar Coyle\n\nFull details â€”\_http://london.pydata.org/schedule/presentation/5/"
