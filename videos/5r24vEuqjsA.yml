description: "In this 2018 GDC talk, PlayEveryWare's Thomas O'Connor shines a light on the technical and administrative work that goes into getting a console game out the door. Drawing from the work he's done porting indie games to consoles for other studios, and as a developer support engineer at Nintendo, he'll show the audience how they can prepare their own games to be ready for releasing on any console.\n\nRegister for GDC: http://ubm.io/2gk5KTU\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
