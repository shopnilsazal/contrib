title: 'RailsConf 2015 - What I''ve Learned in 7 Years of Podcasting about Ruby'
recordingDate: 1431106467
description: "by Charles Wood\n\nYou may be surprised to know that the things that you learn after talking to hundreds of programmers (mostly about Ruby) is that the lessons you learn are mostly lessons about people. The oddest thing about this is that it's had a very profound effect on the way I write code.\n\nWe will walk through the years of podcasting and screencasting shows like Ruby Rogues, Rails Coach, and Teach Me To Code and discuss what we can learn from each other, what I've learned from you, and how that changes who we are and how we code."
