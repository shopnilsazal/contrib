description: 'Charles Cecil, the influential game designer best known for his work creating seminal adventure games like the Broken Sword franchise and Beneath A Steel Sky, delivered a Classic Game Postmortem about the groundbreaking Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars at GDC Europe 2014. Cecil currently serves as the managing director of Revolution Software, the venerable U.K. game development studio he co-founded in 1990. Over the past two and a half decades Cecil has repeatedly raised the bar for games as a storytelling medium, releasing a string of award-winning adventure titles and earning a number of top honors, including an appointment to the Order of the British Empire in 2011. Here, he spoke at length about his work writing and directing "Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars", the award-winning 1996 adventure game that developers at studios like Telltale Games and the now-defunct LucasArts cite as a meaningful influence on their work.'
