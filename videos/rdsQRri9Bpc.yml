description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\nThursday, September 18 • 2:00pm - 2:45pm\n\nLean Security for Small or Medium Sized Business\n\nFor a small or medium sized business (SMB) the fallout from a security or privacy incident can be at best a PR nightmare. At their worst it can cause irrecoverable damage and end your business by impacting sales or ad revenue. Your user base may take a hit. You may need to draft a blog post or email your customers describing the incident and asking them to change passwords. A key culprit is budget constraints – as a SMB you are allocating resources to innovating, creating, and improving your product. Security, while important, isn't always the primary objective.\n\nOur talk will introduce a simple framework for SMBs to focus their security efforts. We will then discuss a common scenario applicable to most SMBs that employs our framework; and leverages it to introduce cheap and effective security mechanisms that provide prevention, limitation, detection, and response capabilities. The key take away will be the thought process and sample techniques that can enable a SMB to take their rag-tag security outfit and turn it into a business enabler.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\nJonathan Chittenden\niSEC Partners\nPrior to his employment with iSEC, Jonathan worked for the Air Force as a civilian.
