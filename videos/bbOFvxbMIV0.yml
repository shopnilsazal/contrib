description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #4\n7 May 2017\nSponsored by Deep Learning Academy  and hosted by Campus Tel Aviv\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nThe ever-increasing size of modern datasets combined with the difficulty of obtaining labeled information has made semi-supervised learning one of the problems of significant practical importance in modern data analysis. VAE offers a novel way to enforce structure on the representation surface, by doing so, it opens the possibility of employing traditional semi supervised learning techniques on the structured embedding space. In this talk I will cover how VAE impose latent space structure constraint, and how we can use it in a semi-supervised settings.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
