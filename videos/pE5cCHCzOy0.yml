description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Ana Baotić, Asseco SEE.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-40\n\nAn application ID might define your app among all others, but its signature is what proves and confirms its identity and integrity. From working in distributed teams to fending off fraudulent clones of your application, you eventually come to understand the importance of signatures.\n\nIn this talk we'll take a deep dive into the Android keystore system, certificates and signatures, and go over key points necessary for any application's long and productive life. Also, we will cover some security tips and tricks that will help ensure your app is safe to use, even if the users are faced with its evil twin.\n\nAt the end you should walk away with a deeper insight into everyday mechanisms that are often taken for granted, and the impact that they have on your users' security.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
