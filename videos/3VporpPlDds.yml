title: 'GeeCON 2017: Dan Heidinga - OpenJ9: Under the hood of the next open source JVM'
recordingDate: 1502694906
description: 'Come explore how a production JVM takes your application class files, the compiled Java code you’ve written, and loads them into the managed runtime in a form that can be executed. This session provides anyone interested in hacking on a production managed runtime with the background necessary to understand the design of OpenJ9, the upcoming open source project based on IBM’s production JVM and the Eclipse OMR project. It focuses on the key data structures used in the core JVM because understanding these data structures enables anyone to hack on the JVM and to take better advantage of the JVM features in their applications. Learn how the J9 Java VM operates, why there’s a ROM/RAM class division and the state changes that the data can under go from interpreted to jitted execution.'
