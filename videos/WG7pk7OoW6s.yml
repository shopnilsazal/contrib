description: "Peter Berghammer: A Journalist's Perspective on Security Research\n\nThe presentation details the process whereby journalists select, discard, research and ultimately publish security related articles. It outlines the credibility necessary for security researchers to be taken seriously in the presentation of their findings and examines the \"blowback\" that criminal and kiddie hackers have on the security industry from a journalists perspective. This talk also looks at the current practices of legitimate software companies between secure content (DRM et al), metadata tracking, hardware and software tracking, and the very close parallels between their methods and those of the \"hacking\" universe. \n\nPeter Berghammer owns a number of companies in the military and consumer electronics market spaces. Additionally he has written monthly articles for the past few years dealing with security, the law, legislation. In 2005 he was named a Fellow at Stanford Law's Center for Internet and Society (researching security items and munitions law). He speaks frequently in international venues on items surrounding security, security breaches, privacy issues and pending legislation. Full bio info at: www.zoominfo.com"
