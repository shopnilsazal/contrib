description: "\"AI on a Pi\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - Anfiteatro 1]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nIn recent months, Artificial Intelligence has become the hottest topic in the IT industry. In this session, we’ll first explain how Deep Learning — a subset of AI — differs from traditional Machine Learning and how it can help you solve complex problems such as computer vision or natural language processing. Then, we’ll show you how to start writing Deep Learning applications in Python thanks to MXNet, a popular library for Deep Learning for both CPUs and GPUs. We'll also see how to use pre-trained models and we'll load one on a Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera. Finally, we’ll show random objects to the Pi…and listen to what it thinks the objects are, thanks to the text-to-speech capabilities of Amazon Polly.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
