description: "Client-side MVC is a different beast from the one we're used to in Rails. On the client, more than anywhere else, the M is the key to creating powerful user experiences.\n\nTo demonstrate this principle in action, we'll first create an in-memory model of what a color is, and then use it to build an interactive 3D color chooser that is both beautiful and intuitive.\n\nSound hard? Not with when you're armed with well defined models... not when you've got the Power of M on your side.\n\nCharles is a rubyist and entrepreneur who has been building software human interfaces for over ten years.\n\nA founder at The Frontside, he is also the creator of several open source projects that bridge together the worlds of Ruby and JavaScript including The Ruby Racer and The Ruby Rhino.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG02/"
