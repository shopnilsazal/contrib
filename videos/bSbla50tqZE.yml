description: "By, Kylie Stradley \n\"Did you really think you could make changes to the database by editing the schema file? Who are you, Amelia Bedelia?\"\n\nThe silly mistakes we all made when first learning Rails may be funny to us now, but we should remember how we felt at the time. New developers don't always realize senior developers were once beginners too and may assume they are the first and last developer to mix up when to use the rails and rake commands.\n\nThis talk is a lighthearted examination of the kinds of common errors many Rails developers make and will dig into why so many of us make the same mistakes.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/G71W/"
