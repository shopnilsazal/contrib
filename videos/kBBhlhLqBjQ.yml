description: "Remaining Covert in an Overt World\n\nMichael Raggo, Director, Security Research, MobileIron; Chet Hosmer, Founder of WetStone Technologies, Inc.\n\nWith the explosion of social media, sharing apps, and an overall world of overtness, some of us are seeking ways to communicate covertly and protect our privacy. This has prompted the emergence of new and enhanced covert communications. This includes methods for hiding data within apps, communication protocols, and even enhanced techniques for hiding data within data. In this talk we'll explore the most recent techniques for secret communications and hiding data, while also exploring new ideas for covert storage in wearables, mobile devices, and more with walkthroughs and demos.\n\nMichael Raggo (Twitter: @MikeRaggo) Michael applies over 20 years of security technology experience and evangelism to the technical delivery of Mobile Security Solutions. Mr. Raggo's technology experience includes mobile device security, penetration testing, wireless security assessments, compliance assessments, incident response and forensics, security research, and is a former security trainer.
