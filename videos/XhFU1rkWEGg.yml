title: 'PyConUK 2016: Some challenges in automatic English text correction'
language: English
recordingDate: 1477337992
description: "Tatiana Al-Chueyr Martins\n\nSome applications in the market assist users to correct different writing mistakes, including spelling and grammar errors. However, very rarely these tools are used by school teachers. For most of them, it is still time consuming and tedious to correct (beginners) student essays.\n\nThis talk will introduce some challenges in automatic English text correction. It will also present how it is possible to use Python libraries (scikit-learn, SciPy and NumPy) in order to spot English mistakes such as: articles, capitalization and spelling.\n\nIn order to train and test the classifier, an open dataset will be used: EF-Cambridge Open Language Dataset (https://corpus.mml.cam.ac.uk/efcamdat/).\n\nDuring the presentation, the accuracy of the implementation will be compared to at least one commercial application and a similar open source tool. It will be discussed how this kind of work can bring value to existing educational applications. Limitations and further steps will also be discussed.\n\nThis presentation is a successive work from the cooperation of Education First (language teaching institution) engineers and University of Cambridge language researchers."
