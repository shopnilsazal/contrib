title: 'GeeCON 2017: Anatole Tresch - We donâ€™t need Java EE, use Kubernetes !'
recordingDate: 1502694960
description: 'In this talk we will shortly look at the functionality Docker and Kubernetes (K8S) provides and compare it with the features of a traditional Java EE application server. During the talk we will present a small Java application that reuses traditional Java EE design patterns but will be deployed as Docker containers on Kubernetes. Where possible the application will reuse K8S core features, e.g. for service location, resiliency and scalability. Business logic itself will be implemented based on Vertx.io with a Hazelcast cluster backend and some distributed NoSQL persistent storage. The result is small, lean and fast Java code that fully focuses on the business aspects, but written without any current application server technologies. Winding up I will shorty strive the idea how Kubernetes even be used as a single application runtime container being deployed to your customers environment.'
