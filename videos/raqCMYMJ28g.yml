title: 'DEF CON 12 - Adam Laurie and Martin Herfurt, Bluesnarfing:The Risk From Digital Pickpockets'
recordingDate: 1392705192
description: "Adam Laurie and Martin Herfurt,Bluesnarfing The Risk From Digital Pickpockets\nIn November 2003, Adam discovered serious flaws in the authentication and data transfer mechanisms on some bluetooth enabled devices, and, in particular, mobile phones including commonly used Nokia, Sony Ericsson and Motorola models. Shortly thereafter, Martin Herfurt of Salzburg Research Forschungsgesellschaft mbH expanded on these problems, and teamed up with Adam to investigate further.\n\nThis talk will cover the issues arising out of these flaws, including loss of personal data, identity theft, phone tapping, tracking, fraud and theft of service. The threat to individuals and corporates will be examined, and statistics and examples from the real world presented, as well as live demonstrations of each of the problems. Details of how the industry reacted, what they did, didn\"t and should have done will also be discussed.\n\nThis will be a fun talk and a real eye-opener for those with bluetooth enabled devices.\n\nFor further background information on the issue, see:\nhttp://www.thebunker.net/release-bluestumbler.htm\n\nAdam Laurie is Chief Security Officer and Director of AL Digital Ltd. and The Bunker. He started in the computer industry in the late Seventies, working as a computer programmer on PDP-8 and other mini computers, and then on various Unix, Dos and CP/M based micro computers as they emerged in the Eighties. He quickly became interested in the underlying network and data protocols, and moved his attention to those areas and away from programming, starting a data conversion company which rapidly grew to become Europe's largest specialist in that field (A.L. downloading Services). During this period, he successfully disproved the industry lie that music CDs could not be read by computers, and, with help from his brother Ben, wrote the world's first CD ripper, \"CDGRAB\". At this point, he and Ben became interested in the newly emerging concept of \"The Internet\", and were involved in various early open source projects, the most well known of which is probably their own \"Apache-SSL\" which went on to become the de-facto standard secure web server. Since the late Nineties they have focused their attention on security, and have been the authors of various papers exposing flaws in Internet services and/or software, as well as pioneering the concept of re-using military data centres (housed in underground nuclear bunkers) as secure hosting facilities. Adam has been a senior member of staff at DEFCON since 1997, and also acted as a member of staff during the early years of the Black Hat Briefings.\n\nMartin Herfurt is a researcher at the Salzburg Research Forschungsgesellschaft m.b.H and lecturer in Telecommunications Engineering Degree Program at the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences and Technologies.\n\nHe completed his Telecommunications Engineering Degree at the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences and Technologies in 2001. Alongside his study Martin was involved in numerous industry projects, providing him with commercial programming practise.\n\nIn 2000 Martin followed up his formal study with a four-month internship at the telecommunications institute of TELCOT institute in San Ramon, California, USA.\n\nSince the second half of 2000 Martin has been working as a full time researcher at Salzburg Research Forschungsgesellschaft m.b.H. His project responsibilities range from the co-ordination of a European IST project with a total budget of over 5 million Euro to software agents development.\n\nTogether with a Salzburg Research colleague, Martin began in the summer of 2003 a class on mobile data services at the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences and Technologies.\n\nMartin is also currently working on a PhD in computer science at the University of Salzburg.\n\nAs part of his fascination with the rapid development in computer programming Martin has become a regular participant in the Chaos Communication Congress which is a yearly meeting of the German hacker association CCC."
