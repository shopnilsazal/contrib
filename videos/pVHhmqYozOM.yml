description: "Lonestar ElixirConf 2017- Opening Keynote by Justin Schneck\n\nDeveloping \"hardware and hardware accessories\" can be difficult and time consuming. Until now, you would have to constantly swap SD cards or create and push full firmware updates in order to iterate on your device. We want to make the development cycle as comfortable as possible by marrying the fundamentals of Erlang hot code reloading with connected Hardware in the Loop (HIL). Together, we will explore the Nerves development cycle through live demonstrations from mix nerves.new to mix firmware. Furthermore, we will push live code updates and even leverage the Phoenix Live Reloader on the Target. Finally, we will take a peek at executing ExUnit tests on connected hardware."
