description: "PyData London 2015\n\nWe would like to share our experience with a python-based Collective Knowledge SDK for collaborative and reproducible experimentation. It helps organize and share experimental setups (code, data and meta) as unified and reusable components with JSON API via GITHUB. It also helps unify, automate and crowdsource analysis and exploration of multi-dimensional optimization spaces using scikit-learn.\n\nSlides available here: http://github.com/ctuning/ck"
