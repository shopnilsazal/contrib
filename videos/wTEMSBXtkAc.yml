But what is the reality of medical device security across the enterprise? Join us for an in-depth presentation about a three-year independent research project, encompassing medical devices across all modalities inside today’s healthcare landscape. Think they are firewalled off? Well think again. Scarier yet, many remain Internet facing and are vulnerable to strategic attack with the potential loss for human life. And yes you will be amazed at what we found in just 1 hour! We will prove that an attacker can access medical devices at thousands of healthcare facilities from anywhere in the world with the potential loss of human life.\n\nThis discussion will also highlight the fallout from security standards not being a requirement for medical device manufacturers, and our experience in identifying and reporting vulnerabilities. We will provide our insight into what needs to be done for healthcare organizations to respond to the new threat of cyber-attack against medical devices. We are working towards a future where cyber security issues in medical devices are a thing of the past. We will discuss the recent success and traction we have gained with healthcare organizations, federal agencies and device manufacturers in addressing these security issues. The train is now moving, so please join us to find out how you can get involved and make a difference by ensuring patient safety.\n\nScott Erven is a healthcare security visionary and thought leader; with over 15 years’ experience in Information Technology & Security.
