description: "Reporting Live from the Ramp of Death by Thijs Cadier\n\nLying on the beach and enjoying the 4-hour work week: who wouldn't like the recurring revenue stream of a SaaS business? It's why many start building a SaaS company \"on the side\", only to find out they don't make enough money to buy a latte and fall back to getting paid by the hour. They're stuck on the long, slow Ramp of Death.\n\nComing to you live from the trenches of running an organically growing SaaS for five years, this is an honest –and sometimes brutal– story of perseverance, sacrifice and reward. Find out how to overcome the ramp, and why it isn't as bad as you might think."
