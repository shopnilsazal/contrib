description: "Orbital Rocket Guidance with Ruby by Nate Berkopec\n\nUsing the popular space simulator Kerbal Space Program and some remote procedure calls, we're going to use Ruby to launch (simulated) rockets into space! We'll discuss the history of computing in the space program, real-life algorithms for getting rockets into orbit like the Space Shuttle's Powered Explicit Guidance Ascent System, and the software architecture of historic space computers like the Apollo Guidance Computer. Finally, we'll build our own orbital rocket, controlled by a Ruby program that emulates space computers of the past."
