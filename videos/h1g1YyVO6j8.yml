description: "By, Bradley Grzesiak \nAerospace engineering is really no more magical than programming, and yet it's shrouded in such mystery and mysticism that practically no one bothers to study it. I'll show you how to apply concepts from rocket science to challenging software problems, allowing you to spend more time coming up with answers rather than interpreting inputs. We'll also learn to control the universe outside our glowing rectangles.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HKp5/"
