description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/materials/ \n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT: \n\nThe cloud presents a huge opportunity for modern businesses to reduce cost and complexity -- but doing so at the cost of reduced security is a non-starter for many organizations. Those responsible for security oversight within their organizations lose sleep over the security of critical data. What if some unforeseen problem with someone else's applications or controls exposes all of this sensitive information sitting in the cloud? In traditional security models, encryption solved most of these data security worries, but the cloud has introduced new challenges and problems with this approach. Fortunately, several novel technical approaches are evolving to alleviate many of these traditional, limited approaches, and in the long-term, make the cloud a more secure model for both software and data. \n\nWhat Attendees will learn:\n\n·         New techniques for encryption that will allow organizations to operate on fully-encrypted data -- even though it's sitting in the cloud\n\n·         Several different approaches, real-world tradeoffs and best practices for maximizing security, functionality and performance.\n\n·         Clarity around the various approaches to data encryption for the cloud era.\n\n·         How to perform fast, full wildcard searching.\n\n·         Through real-life examples, learn how to maximize cloud security for both software and data.\n\nABOUT JOHN VIEGA\n\nJohn is Executive Vice President of Products, Strategy and Engineering at Perimeter E-Security.  At Perimeter, John is responsible for product management, product marketing, engineering and thought leadership.\n\nJohn has authored numerous books on security, including the recent \"Myths of Security\", \"The Secure Programming Cookbook\", \"Network Security with OpenSSL\" and the seminal \"Building Secure Software\", which was the first book on application security.  He is also well-known for being the original author of the Mailman mailing list manager, and other prominent open source software packages.\n\nJohn is the editor-in-chief for IEEE Security and Privacy magazine, and his technical work in cryptography has been standardized by NIST, the IEEE and IETF.\n\nPrior to Perimeter, John was at McAfee, where he was CTO and VP of Engineering for the Software-as-a-Service business unit. He was also McAfee's Chief Security Architect, where he worked on M&A and also owned McAfee's core technologies, such as anti-virus and the SiteAdvisor product. John also founded Secure Software, raising a Series A from Charles River Ventures. The company was later acquired by Fortify, where John was an advisor through the acquisition by Hewlett Packard. John holds a MS in Computer Science and a BA from the University of Virginia."
