description: "RailsConf 2017: Implementing the Web Speech API for Voice Data Entry by Cameron Jacoby\n\nWe live in a world where you can schedule a meeting by talking to your watch or turn off your lights by asking Alexa as if she were your roommate. But would voice dictation work for something more intensive, like a web app used for hours of data entry?\n\nIn this talk, I’ll show you how to implement the Web Speech API in a few simple steps. I’ll also walk through a case study of using the API in a production Rails app. You’ll leave with an understanding of how to implement voice dictation on the web as well as criteria to evaluate if voice is a viable solution to a given problem."
