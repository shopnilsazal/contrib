description: "Syke - Opensource utilities and how to use them to test IDSes and firewalls.\n\nThis talk showcases free/opensource utilities and how to use them to test IDSes and firewalls. There have been a few talks on the common weaknesses of both kinds of products, but no practical means by which to test for said weaknesses. The point of the talk is to enable people to test vendor's claims (or their own products) themselves. This talkwould be of interest to developers, security admins, product reviewers, and white/blackhat hackers. Knowledge of TCP/IP and programming are recommended.\n\nI. What are firewalls/IDSes supposed to do? (expectations)\na. stateful and non-stateful packet filters\nb. network-based and host-based IDSes\n\nII. Common failings \na. firewall 1. DoS 2. evasion\nb. IDS 1. DoS 2. evasion\n\nIII. How do you test for this?\na. Everyone's favorite: nmap 1. firewall exploits: filling up state table\n2. IDS exploits: fragmentation, ACK/FIN scans\nb. The isic suite of utilities 1. firewall: options handling/frag DoS, packet leakage\n2. IDS: IDSes that process options/state confused\nc. Sample programs included with libnet 1. firewall: boink, ping of death, etc\nd. whisker 1. IDS: evasion \n\nIV. Demonstration a. IDS: against libNIDS, IDS test cases above\nb. firewalls: against netfilter, firewall test cases above\n\nsyke is a member of New Hack City, a hacker collective based in San Francisco. He has 2 years of experience testing firewall and IDS products at a major vendor of security software. \nDEF CON 8.0 was held July 28th - 30th, 2000, in Las Vegas, Nevada USA\nPast speeches and talks from DEF CON hacking conferences in an iTunes friendly m4v format. The DEFCON series of hacking conferences were started in 1993 to focus on both the technical and social trends in hacking, and has grown to be world known event. If you did not make it, or missed the speaker you wanted to see here is you chance to download and watch the presentations when you want."
