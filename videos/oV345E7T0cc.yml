description: "Using Ruby in data science by Kenta Murata\n\nI will talk about the current situation and the future of Ruby in the field of data science.\n\nCurrently, Ruby can be used practically in data science. In the first half of this talk, I will perform some demonstrations to prove this. You will see that pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and several deep learning frameworks are available from Ruby scripts in these demos.\n\nIn the future, in order for Ruby to continue to be used in data science, we need to continue some efforts. In the latter half of this talk, we will introduce Red Data Tools project that plays an important role in this context."
