title: 'Above the Clouds: Investigating Systems from 32,000 ft.'
recordingDate: 1345375169
description: 'Watching information flow through a system, from one node to another fascinates me. It''s like witnessing a naturally process, watching water crawl through a brook, or bees swarming a hive. How do you see your information in motion? I will share three case studies of testing throughput on various Ruby applications and ''cloud'' platforms: using an Erlang tool called Bench, writing a quick-and-dirty custom tool written in Bash, and modeling a discrete event simulation written in Ruby. Along the way I will weave together themes of Computology, system simulations, and testing vs modeling in the sense of Operational Research.'
