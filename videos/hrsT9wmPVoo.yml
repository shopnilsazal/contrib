title: 'RailsConf 2014 - Software Development Lessons from the Apollo Program by Julian Simioni'
language: English
recordingDate: 1400784937
description: "In 1961, MIT was awarded the contract for a guidance system to fly to the moon, the first for the entire Apollo Program. Software was not mentioned. Six years later, the project had 400 engineers writing code.\n\nThe Apollo Guidance Computer flew men to the moon before UNIX or C were created, and is to this day a marvel of engineering.\n\nNASA and MIT records of its creation allow us to look back on some pioneers of our industry, relive their experiences, and maybe learn a few things ourselves.\n\nJulian Simioni is a software developer at 42floors in San Francisco, CA. When not working tirelessly to bring technology to the world of commercial real estate, he can be found riding his bicycle, flying planes, and eating spaghetti.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGZf/"
