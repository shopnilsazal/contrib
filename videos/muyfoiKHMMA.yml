language: English
recordingDate: 1400685327
description: "Wizards have been common in web applications since the dawn of the Internet, with the most popular example being the Shopping Cart, yet many struggle with writing wizard code effectively, resulting in a huge untraceable rat's nest of copy/paste code. In fact, many implementations violate REST and include Fat Controllers as well as overly complicated wizard-step management, data, session, and validation code. This talk covers a better way that yields Ultra Light and Maintainable Rails Wizards!\n\nAndy Maleh leads at Big Astronaut by embracing agile practices and software craftsmanship while perfecting software products. He helped Groupon develop their 33M-user-website by working on user subscription and personalization features. Andy likes to drum, snowboard, and longboard in his free time.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0P/"
