recordingDate: 1516816639
description: "Reactive programming offers Java developers a way to build message-driven, elastic, resilient, and responsive services...yet many Java developers don't know where to begin. The Reactive Streams initiative provides a baseline and Project Reactor provides a great way to become immediately productive, leveraging reactive capabilities from end to end. Whether you're coming from a Spring MVC environment or a functional perspective, Reactor empowers you to spin up fully reactive Spring Boot 2 applications quickly and efficiently. In this talk, the presenter dives into the net-new Netty-based web runtime and shows you how to:\n\nintegrate easily with existing Spring-stack technologies\neasily transition from blocking to reactive applications & systems\ndefine your API in an imperative style *and* functionally, reaping all benefits both ways\nleverage powerful new testing mechanisms to make code better and life easier\n_The presenter will code all examples live and in real time_. This is not an abstract discussion, come to gain real, practical knowledge!"
