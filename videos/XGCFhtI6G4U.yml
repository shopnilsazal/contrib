description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Vadim Caen and Jerome Gaillard, Google.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-5\nSlides link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSanSP0pxPRNSXi1r8VUNyru6mkBN6HifcQE9nUQcgOG96fDwEByXaWIiEh2O73EhDEbPGI4oO0Al7z/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000&slide=id.gc6f9544c1_0_0\n\nNowadays, Android app design needs are more and more complex: shadows, animations, illustrations, dynamic content. Building layouts that incorporate all those features can be time consuming and, made the wrong way, they will have a significant negative impact on the overall app performance.\n\nIn this talk we are going to go through building a layout from scratch in Android Studio, demonstrating how developers can take advantage of the latest features to make the whole process as efficient as possible.\nAlong the way we will highlight some of the best practices and show how to avoid common pitfalls in order to create complex yet lightweight layouts.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
