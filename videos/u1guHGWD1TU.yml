title: 'GORUCO 2015: Zachary Feldman: Home Automation with the Amazon Echo and Ruby'
recordingDate: 1435942273
description: "@zachfeldman\nThe Amazon Echo recently debuted and made a big splash with its incredibly accurate voice recognition, capable of hearing and transliterating commands from 20-30 feet away. Home automation enthusiasts and hackers alike wondered if it would be possible to intercept commands from the device and trigger custom actions. While device traffic is encrypted, the device pushes commands to a history page in a web application. Using Watir WebDriver, which normally is used for feature testing, we've created a proxy that can be run on a Raspberry Pi as well as a modular Ruby framework based on Sinatra to run custom commands, allowing us to control the Hue wireless lighting system, Nest, and even request an Uber!\n \nTalk given at GORUCO 2015: http://goruco.com"
