description: "PyData Dallas 2015\nH2O – Now with a Python interface! It’s open-source Machine Learning, in-memory big-data clustered computing – Math At Scale.H2O has the Worlds Fastest Logistic Regression (by a lot!), Distributed Deep Learning, world’s first (and fastest) distributed Gradient Boosted Method (GBM), plus Random Forest, PCA, Naive Bayes, Cox Proportional Hazards, KMeans++, and much more. And now we can do the same data-munging in python as we've been able to do in R for the past year, built on the same REST/JSON based API. Build test/train splits on tera-scale datasets in seconds, impute the mean, throw out outliers, run group-bys and joins and do all your basic data munging from your standard laptop python / ipython / ide, and yet work on giant datasets."
