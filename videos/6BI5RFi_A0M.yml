description: "Pragmatic Lessons of Rails & Ruby in the Enterprise by Nathan Beyer\n\nAdopting Rails and Ruby for use within a large development organization was and continues to be an adventure. Rails and Ruby have been in use at Cerner for 7 years and over that time, their use has gone from niche technology used by a handful of people to a core platform used by hundreds. Along this adventure, we have learned many lessons and gained lots of experience. In this talk, weâ€™ll share the interesting up and downs of this adventure in an effort to share our experiences and knowledge.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Jkon/"
