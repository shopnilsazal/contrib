description: "By, Josh Szmajda\n\nHaskell is a functional programming language that cleanly separates pure algorithms from messy real-world concerns. To learn how it ticks, I've translated an algorithm for Simulated Annealing from Haskell to Ruby. It also gave me an excuse to play with ruby-processing, a toolkit for graphics processing ;). Come learn about Functional Programming and how it can make your Ruby better!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FrUY/"
