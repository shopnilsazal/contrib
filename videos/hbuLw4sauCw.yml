description: "JavaScript 7: the Evolution of JavaScript by Jafar Husain\n\nMany web developers are already familiar with JavaScript 6. Maybe you are already using a transpiler and have gotten a glimpse of how much easier JavaScript development can be with features like arrow functions, generators, and destructuring. You may be surprised to learn that JavaScript 6 is only the beginning. The committee is already hard at work on JavaScript 7, and it’s not too early to get a glimpse of some of the features being proposed. While version 6 brought JavaScript to parity with other popular scripting languages, version 7 may introduce powerful new features never seen in a popular programming language. Imagine building an entire JavaScript program without a single callback, and being able to build asynchronous programs with simple primitives like loops.\nSome of these features have already appeared in modern browsers, and it’s not too early to start playing with them. Come glimpse into the future and start thinking about how to write forward compatible JavaScript applications today.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GVIn/"
