recordingDate: 1520511824
description: "by Brian Duggan\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe phrase \"\"Domain Specific Language\"\" can be used to describe a set ofsyntactic constructs which either form an independent language, or are part ofa more general language. Informal DSLs arise from particular communities,evolve over time and often lack formal specifications. Examples include:templating languages, micro web frameworks, and various wiki markup languages.Perl 6 provides a number of mechanisms for parsing and interpreting suchinformal DSLs, including custom operators, grammars, and slangs. In this talk,we examine these mechanisms and demonstrate how they can be applied tospecific DSLs.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 10:45:00"
