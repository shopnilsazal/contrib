title: 'Rails Conf 2013 What Ruby Developers Can Learn From Go by Lionel Barrow'
recordingDate: 1369250900
description: "Go has rapidly built a reputation as a great language for web development. But as Rails developers, we already have a really, really great language for web development -- why should we be interested in Go?\nI'm convinced that every web developer would benefit from exposure to the Go approach to programming, which places a strong emphasis on up-front error handling and modular, namespaced libraries. Let's sit down and compare some code!\nIn this talk, we will: \n* Compare idiomatic approaches to common problems such as error handling, dependency management and testing in Go and Ruby. \n* Think carefully about tradeoffs between different programming styles and examine how programming languages encourage one style or another. \n* Tease out common ideas and best practices that apply to all web applications, regardless of language or framework. \n* Read a bunch of code.\nWe will not: \n* Try to convince anyone to ditch Ruby/Rails and embrace Go. \n* Make vague, unsubstantiated claims about the benefits of static or dynamic typing. \n* Assume any prior knowledge of Go."
