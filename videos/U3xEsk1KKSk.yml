description: "Introduction to emerging JSON-based ID and Security protocols\n\nSpeaker: Brian Campbell, Ping Identity\n\nDate & Time: Wednesday, November 6th, 6:00\n\nThis talk will look at JOSE and emerging JSON based ID protocols.\n\nAs Portfolio Architect for Ping Identity, Brian Campbell aspires to one day know what a Portfolio Architect actually does for a living. In the meantime, he's tried to make himself useful with little things like designing and building much of PingFederate, the product that put Ping Identity on the map. When not making himself useful, he contributes to various identity and security standards including a two-year stint as co-chair of the OASIS Security Services Technical Committee (SAML) and is currently contributing to OAuth and JOSE in the IETF as well as OpenID Connect. He holds a B.A., magna cum laude, in Computer Science from Amherst College in Massachusetts. Despite spending four years in the state, he has to look up how to spell \"Massachusetts\" every time he writes it."
