description: "Effie Mouzeli, Logicea LLC\n\nWhat happens when you take the leap of faith and leave the security of a systems engineering team to become the first systems person at a startup? What should you expect?\n\nThis talk is about the challenges of being the sole systems engineer at a young company. The amount of work is overwhelming but the experience is worth it. We will explain the key elements of a newborn infrastructure and the stages leading it to maturity.\n\nThe challenges of this role are not limited to solving technical problems. The habits, processes and standards you will establish, will pave the way to go from a single engineer to a team.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
