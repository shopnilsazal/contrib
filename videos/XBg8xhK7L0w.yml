title: '#HITB2016AMS D2T1 - CANsee: An Automobile Intrusion Detection System - Jun Li'
recordingDate: 1467281228
description: "Automotive security is a hot research area but up till now, research has only centered around how to attack with no single complete solution for defense.\n\nAfter 2 years of research, I have developed a machine learning based IDS for automobiles to detect abnormal traffic on the CANBUS and built a very low-cost device that can be used to capture raw CAN traffic and wirelessly transmit the data to a computer, mobile phone, or a central server for further analysis. I call this device CANsee – an IDS designed to be deployed as an accessory to detect abnormal behavior of any node on a vehicles internal network.\n\nIn this session, I will briefly introduce the inner workings of a modern automobile and summarize the attack vectors available and will then explain how we can use CANsee to detect anomalous behavior. In addition, I will fully open source CANsee at HITBSecConf2016 – Amsterdam including schematics, bill of materials and source code.  We may also give out some free samples :) \n\n======\n\nJun Li is a security researcher at Unicorn Team in the largest Chinese security company Qihoo360. He is currently pursuing his masters degree from Chengdu University of Information Technology with a major in IoT security. During his undergraduate studies, he switched between different majors – 2 years in Automobile Electronics and 2 years in Electronic and Electric Engineering. His focus area is in the security of the Internet of Things and the security of automobile electronics. Jun Li along with his colleagues Lin Huang, Yingtao Zeng and Qing Yang at UnicornTeam have previously found several automobile vulnerabilities in Volvo, BMW,  Audi, Mercedes Benz and BYD’s GPS."
