recordingDate: 1438283940
description: "Confident Code by: Avdi Grimm\n\nAre your methods timid? Do they constantly second-guess themselves, checking for nil values, errors, and unexpected input?\nEven the cleanest Ruby codebases can become littered over time with nil checks, error handling, and other interruptions which steal attention away from the essential purpose of the code. This talk will discuss strategies for writing your Ruby classes and methods in a confident, straightforward style; without sacrificing functionality or robustness. In the process, we'll cover concepts and techniques points including:\nThe narrative style of method construction\nThe four parts of a method\nThree strategies for dealing with uncertain input\nMassaging input with coercion and the Decorator pattern\nLightweight preconditions\nExterminating nils from your code\nThe chaining and iterative styles of method construction\nEliminating conditionals with the Special Case and Null Object patterns\nIsolating errors with the Bouncer and Checked Method patterns"
