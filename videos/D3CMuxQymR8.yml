description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nWho What How: Understanding Kubernetes Development through DevStats - Josh Berkus, Red Hat Inc. & Łukasz Gryglicki, CNCF (Any Skill Level)\n\nDid you know that Kubernetes has its own analytics gold mine about who contributed, when they did it, and how? DevStats.k8s.io offers a data smorgasbord which slices up Kubernetes contribution activities. This isn't jus for data geeks, though: SIG leads, team managers, project and community managers, and even regular contributors can derive useful insights about how development is doing and where they might need to pitch in through the stats. In this talk, we will cover the charts and data offered by DevStats with an eye towards finding insights for you to take action on. We'll also discuss how you can request additional charts or develop them yourself.\n\nAbout Josh\nJosh Berkus works with the Kubernetes community on behalf of Red Hat Inc. He contributes to sig-release and sig-contribex primarily, and organizes events. In his spare time, he likes to deploy databases, particularly PostgreSQL, on top of Kubernetes and OpenShift. Josh lives in Portland, OR.\n\nAbout Łukasz\nLukas is a software developer with CNCF. He is the primary developer behind DevStats."
