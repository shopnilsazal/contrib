description: "Jim Rennie & Eric Rachner - Search & Seizure & Golfballs\nIn 2008, Eric Rachner was playing a round of Urban Golf with friends in Seattle. When an errant foam ball hit by another player struck a passer-by, the police were called. Eric was standing on the sidewalk minding his own business, and arrested for 'Obstruction' for refusing to identify himself to police. Refusing to back down, Eric took his case to court where it was ultimately dismissed. Today he continues to fight against the Seattle Police, and his story has been featured prominently in local and internet media.\n\nThis talk will provide you with a basic understanding of search and seizure law, so that you can appreciate Eric's story and so you know how to exercise your own rights should the time arise. We'll use Eric's situation as a case study in how the rubber meets the road when it comes to the Constitution and interactions with the police.\n\nJim Rennie is an Attorney, and has been practicing criminal defense law in Las Vegas for nearly 3 years. He spoke previously at DefCon about what to do if you get arrested in Vegas, and on the Creative Commons license.\n\nEric Rachner is a Security Consultant based in Seattle. He previously worked at a major software company in Seattle, and now travels the world as an independent consultant.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
