description: "Sandy \"Mouse\" Clark: Climbing Everest: An Insider's Look at one state's Voting Systems\nHanging Chads, Hopping votes, Flipped votes, Tripled votes, Missing memory cards, Machine malfunctions, Software glitches, Undervotes, Overvotes. Reports of voting machine failures flooded the news after the last elections and left most voters wondering \"Does my vote really count?\" \"Can these electronic voting machines be trusted?\" \"How secure are my state's voting systems?\"\n\nIn December 2007, we published an in depth, source code and hardware analysis of all the voting systems used by the state of Ohio, funded by the Ohio Secretary of State. Come find out what we learned, and draw your own conclusions.\n\nSandy Clark, \"Mouse\" has been taking things apart since the age of two, and still hasn't learned to put them back together. Luckily, in the University of Pennsylvania's Distributed Systems Lab, this behavior is actively encouraged. A founding member of Toool-USA, she also enjoys puzzles, toys, Mao (the card game, not the person) and infrastructure hacking. Her research explores human scale security and the unexpected ways that systems interact.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
