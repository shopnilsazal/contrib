title: '#HITB2016AMS D2T2  - New Methods For Exploiting ORM Injections - Mikhail Egorov and Sergey Soldatov'
recordingDate: 1467003263
description: "The majority of applications written in Java use Object-relational Mapping (ORM) libraries for working with underlying relational database management systems (RDBMS). Java has API for utilizing ORM functionality called Java Persistence API (JPA), which is the part of J2SE and J2EE specifications since version 5. Usage of ORM simplifies database programming and gives solid benefits to the developer over plain JDBC, like providing database and schema independence, leveraging object oriented programming and object model usage, providing performance features (caching and sophisticated database and query optimizations).\n\nIn this talk, we dive deep into internals of popular ORM libraries in Java: EclipseLink, TopLink, Hibernate, OpenJPA, JPA for WebSphere Application Server (JPA for WAS). We’ll cover how JPQL/HQL statements are processed and transformed into SQL statements for underlying RDBMS. For all these ORM libraries we’ve identified oddities in processing of JPQL/HQL statements that allowed us to bypass ORM restrctions and access arbitrary tables in the underlying database. More precisely, we found methods for exploiting JPQL or HQL injections as plain blind SQL injections.\n\nJPQLi/HQLi exploitation techniques we’ve identified works for popular RDBMS used in Java ecosystem: SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, SAP HANA. The part of our work regarding injection exploitation in Hibernate ORM library for MySQL, Postgresql, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server have been already presented on ZeroNights 0x05 conference. Here we extend our previous research to other popular ORM libraries and RDBMS widely deployed in Java ecosystem.\n\n======\n\nMikhail Egorov is an independent security researcher and bug hunter from Russia. His main interests lay in web application security, mobile security, practical cryptography and reverse engineering. Acknowledged by Adobe and Oracle for finding vulnerabilities in their products. Had several talks on Zerohights and PHdays conferences. Authored number of articles in “Xakep” magazine.\nMikhail graduated from Moscow State Technical University n.a. Bauman with master degree in information security. Has about ten years of working experience in information security and programming. Recently, he works for Odin (Ingram Micro Cloud) as the application security engineer.\n\n------\n\nSergey Soldatov is an independent security researcher from Russia. He has more than 10 years of experience in various fields of information security in enterprise, but currently his interests focused on monitoring, incident response and investigation of complex attacks. He had several talks on ZeroNights, Positive hack days and wrote a number of articles for Russian online magazines. Sergey graduated from Bauman Moscow Technical University with degree in information security."
