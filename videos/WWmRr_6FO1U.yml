description: "Spring Framework 5.0 brings a lot of new features all across the framework: functional and reactive as major programming model themes but also some less prominent and less commonly presented features.\n\nThis session summarizes the major feature themes and particularly highlights personal favorites and useful refinements in the details. Last but not least, it will indicate next steps in the upcoming 5.1 release."
