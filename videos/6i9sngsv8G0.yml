description: "by Max Sills\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nIn this talk I will summarize the case law on the contract or license questionin the U.S. Certain obligations under the GPL may be merely contractual,meaning there are less damages and enforcement mechanisms available to aplaintiff, while other obligations may have more teeth. I will use thisanalysis to help the community think about how it might craft softwarelicenses in the future.\n\n\nRoom: H.1301 (Cornil)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 09:50:00"
