description: "Generative art is art that is produced by autonomous systems, rather than directly by humans. Computer-based generative art is usually created in systems that are highly procedural. The procedural lens directs artists’ attention away from the state that underlies their artwork, so it is typically entangled with the execution history of the artwork. By contrast, when creating generative art in functional languages, our tools push us to be explicit about state, with rich consequences. If we combine state awareness with extensible protocols that define how the state changes, we gain the ability to control time over a surprising variety of artworks in a way that seems magical from the procedural mindset.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll introduce a particular class of generative art known as Iterated Function Systems (IFSs). I’ll show how to implement IFSs naively in a procedural fashion using Clojure, and then explain how to transform the procedural solution into a functional one that is explicit about its state. Once we have explicit state, I’ll show how some simple tools to manipulate the state give us time manipulation superpowers. Finally, I’ll generalize the state manipulation of our IFS artwork to create an extensible protocol, and show how to implement the protocol in a completely different kind of artwork, thereby giving us the same superpowers for free.\n\nDan works on Clojure services at Puppet Labs in Portland, OR. He has been using Clojure for four years and has fallen deeply in love with it. He enjoys using code for creative expression.\n\nFor more on Lambda Jam, visit http://www.lambdajam.com"
