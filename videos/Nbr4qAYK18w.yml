description: "The programming paradigm we work in shapes every aspect of how we craft our code, providing a model of what a program is, and what it can and should be. In this talk, we’ll explore the connections between the programs we write, the languages we work in, and the paradigms we use, and try to get some historical and philosophical perspective on the familiar paradigms of imperative, declarative, object-oriented, and functional programming, focusing on the points where they intersect and collide. We’ll discover the valuable lessons different paradigms can teach us, and find motivation to stop arguing with our fellow coders about which is superior, and instead encourage each other - as individuals and a community - to pursue poly-paradigm programming.\n\nEVENT: PolyConf 2017\n\nSPEAKER: Anjana Sofia Vakil\n\nPERMISSIONS: Event organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
