description: "Sever Banesiu - Distributed Workflows with Flowy\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nThis presentation introduces Flowy, a library for building and running\ndistributed, asynchronous workflows built on top of different backends\n(such as Amazonâ€™s SWF). Flowy deals away with the spaghetti code that\noften crops up from orchestrating complex workflows. It is ideal for\napplications that do multi-phased batch processing, media encoding,\nlong-running tasks, and/or background processing.\n\nWe'll start by discussing Flowy's unique execution model and see how\ndifferent execution topologies can be implemented on top of it. During\nthe talk we'll run and visualize workflows using a local backend.\nWe'll then take a look at what it takes to scale beyond a single\nmachine by using an external service like SWF."
