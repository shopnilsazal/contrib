description: "If MRI is a potato peeler that does one thing very well, JRUby is the Swiss Army Knife that offers developers a multitude of tools. JRuby opens doors that MRI has closed, being highly performant and offers access to Java libraries. From the perspective of a former MRI'er, I'll discuss concrete examples of how to realize the benefits of the JRuby stack, drawing examples from my work on an open-source JRuby on Rails app.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGeB/"
