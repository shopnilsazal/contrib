description: "Deviant Ollam - Safe to Armed in Seconds: A Study of Epic Fails of Popular Gun Safes\nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-19/dc-19-presentations/Ollam/DEFCON-19-Ollam-Gun-Safes.pdf\n\nHackers like guns. Hackers like locks. Hackers like to tinker with guns and locks. And, most of the time, hackers protect their guns with high-quality locks. However, while it's one thing to own a nice gun safe protected by a high security dial, that sort of solution tends to be best for the firearms that one doesn't have in daily use. Many of us who wear a firearm as part of our daily routine opt to store and secure our carry piece in a separate, more easily-accessible way at the end of the day. This talk is an in-depth evaluation of some of the most popular small firearm lockboxes in-use today. Some rely on mechanical locks, others on biometric locks, and some offer a combination of both. But overall, they tend to fail miserably in the face of any dedicated attacker. Come and learn how your favorite gun lockbox might be preventing your toddler from having an accidental discharge, but why it's not at all likely to repel a criminal or even perhaps a curious teenager. Means of both attacking as well as improving upon the lockboxes you already may own will be demonstrated, and audience members will be invited to participate in all sorts of attacks... live and on stage!\n\nDeviant Ollam's first and strongest love has always been teaching. A graduate of the New Jersey Institute of Technology's Science, Technology, & Society program, he is always fascinated by the interplay that connects human values and social trends to developments in the technical world. While earning his BS degree at NJIT, Deviant also completed the History degree program at Rutgers University.\n\nWhile paying the bills as a security auditor and penetration testing consultant with The CORE Group, Deviant is also a member of the Board of Directors of the US division of TOOOL, The Open Organisation Of Lockpickers. Every year at DEFCON and ShmooCon Deviant runs the Lockpicking Village, and he has conducted physical security training sessions at Black Hat, DeepSec, ToorCon, HackCon, ShakaCon, HackInTheBox, CanSecWest, ekoparty, and the United States Military Academy at West Point. His favorite Amendments to the US Constitution are, in no particular order, the 1st, 2nd, 9th, & 10th.\nTwitter: @DeviantOllam"
