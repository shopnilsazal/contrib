description: "JAVASCRIPT THERAPY\n\nGenerator functions are pause-able(!) functions, a strange concept that only gets stranger as you learn to put generator code inside while (true) loops(!!). \n\nThis talk aims to help, just like the classic therapist program Eliza, which we’ll reimplement on our path to understanding generators.\n\nJANA BECK\n\nJana Beck is a coffee-fueled engineer at a small open-source and not-for-profit startup called Tidepool, based in the Bay Area of California but with developers on three continents. Tidepool’s mission is to reduce the burden of type 1 diabetes through data technology, and Jana works mostly on Tidepool’s front-end stack (React with redux; D3 for data visualization).\n\nWhen she’s not coding or sleeping, there’s a high probability that Jana is sweating in a gym or a dance studio."
