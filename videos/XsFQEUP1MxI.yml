In the last episode (you can find a link to it in the video description) we explored about why we're do unit testing, which is protect ourselves from being overwhelmed by the growing complexity of our code.\n\nToday, we're going to focus a bit more on what unit testing is, and how unit testing helps with managing complexity."
