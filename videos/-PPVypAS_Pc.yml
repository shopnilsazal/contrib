description: "Reimagining 2D graphics and game development with Ruby by Tom Black \n\nPlaying games and interacting with graphics, media, and devices is fun, but programming them rarely is. Even the simplest things can seem overwhelmingly complex and unnecessarily difficult, but it doesn't have to be that way! Let's explore how Ruby can help us design a more natural and expressive experience by leveraging MRI, mruby, and Opal, opening up possibilities natively and on the web. We'll poke under the hood of a cross-platform 2D engine designed to be scripted with Ruby. Many opportunities lie ahead in game development, education, and creative coding, so let's seize them â€” join us!"
