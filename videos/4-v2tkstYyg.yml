title: 'Reaktor Breakpoint 2018: Aaron Cruz, The professional crypto mining tech stack'
recordingDate: 1528988959
description: "For the last year Aaron has been managing and building software for a medium sized Ethereum mining farm in Central Europe. The current stack is quite eclectic and constantly in flux. It includes Elixir, Golang, Ruby, Node, a ton of bash and YAML, and even some Raspberry Pis thrown in. A hacker's paradise!\n\nIt's been a blast, he's learned a lot, and made a ton of trade-offs. This talk will be an Intro To Crypto Mining mixed with the best parts of the farm's software toolchain. He'll even try to answer the question \"Can you really justify using so much electricity!?\"\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018. For more information, check reaktorbreakpoint.com. \n\n---\n\nAaron Cruz\nDeveloper, Organizer of Elixir Vienna\n\nAaron is a jack of all trades, master of some. Somehow he gets paid to finish hackathon projects. His current interests are the current buzzwords: chatbots, ETH smart contracts, machine learning."
