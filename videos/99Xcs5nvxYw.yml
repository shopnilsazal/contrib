title: 'Yves Hilpisch - DX Analytics -- A Python-based Library for Derivatives Analytics'
recordingDate: 1397475980
description: "View Yves' slides here:\nhttp://www.hilpisch.com/YH_DX_Analytics_London.html\n\nDerivatives analytics is one of the most compute and data intensive areas in the financial industry. This mainly stems from the fact, that Monte Carlo simulation techniques have to be applied in general to value and risk manage single derivatives trades and whole books of derivatives.\n\nDX Analytics is a derivatives analytics library that is completely build in Python and that has a rather Pythonic API. It allows the modeling and valuation of both single- and multi-risk factor derivatives with European and American exercise. It also allows the consistent valuation of complex portfolios of such derivatives, e.g. incorporating the correlation between single risk factors.\n\nThe talk provides some theoretical and technical background information, discusses the basic architectural features of DX Analytics and illustrates its use by a number of simple and more complex examples."
