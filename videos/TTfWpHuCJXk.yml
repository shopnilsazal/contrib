language: English
recordingDate: 1505775820
description: "Jake Pittis, Shopify\n\nFibers get cut, databases crash, and you’ve adopted Chaos Engineering to challenge your production environment as much as possible. But what are you doing to craft the resiliency test suites that minimizes the impact of failure on your application as much as possible? How do you debug resiliency problems locally and make sure single points of failures don't creep into the application in the first place? We’ve used the open-source Toxiproxy for the past two years to emulate timeouts, latency and outages in development environments. This talk will equip you with the tools to start writing resiliency test suites to harden your own applications, to supplement other chaos engineering practises.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
