description: "by IÃ±aki Baz Castillo\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nmediasoup is a WebRTC SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) for Node.js that allowsapplications to run multiparty video conferencing with browser and mobiledevices in a multi-stream fashion.\n\nRather than being yet another standalone media server, mediasoup is a Node.jslibrary/module which can be easily integrated within existing applications.\n\nmediasoup exposes both, the ORTC API and the WebRTC API (same as in browsers),allowing the application to program multiparty video conferencing viaJavaScript. mediasoup is minimalist, it just focuses on media handling. Itdoes not provide, nor it mandates, a specific network signaling protocol.\n\nThe talk will expose the technology behind mediasoup, the API it exposes, anda demo application the assistants will be able to join.\n\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 12:25:00"
