description: "Blinking an led without firmware and micros\n- scavenging scrap hardware\n- the missing endpoint\n- some fancy java code\n- how fast can you go?\n\nGalvanic isolation\n- scavenging more scrap hardware\n\nI need more power\n- a scrap ATX is your best friend\n\nDigital inputs\n- you get those for free!! (well, with a little more java code)\n\nForget the arduino. Forget purchasing microcontrollers. Forget writing firmware. All you need to control the world is your Android phone (or tablet), a little Java code, and a box of scraps. In this talk I’ll show you how to put together an opto-isolated, software-controlled power switch using just scrap parts you can find in the nearest dumpster: a half-broken USB keyboard, a faulty notebook power supply, an ATX power supply from a discarded PC. No custom kernel required: works with standard AOSP. No rooting required either. No firmware to be written, no need to flash anything. All you need is some Java magic and a decent Android device. Be a superhero, save the environment, learn some low-level stuff and brush up on a little electronics. It’s all quite simple, and actually fun."
