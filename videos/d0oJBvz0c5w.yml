description: "Jenkins Pipeline is probably the most powerful tool provided by the Jenkins community to describe and \"execute\" your own CI/CD pipeline.\nThere are two ways to describe it : Scripted and Declarative. Both have their pros and cons but if you don't try to control complexity, both can be very hard and painful to maintain with the time.\n\nDuring this talk, we'll begin by discussing about the current state of Jenkins and its community, and then provide best practices and advices to keep your Pipeline(s) and CI/CD configuraiton simple, maintainable and testable.\nWith some practical demos and goodies, of course :-)"
