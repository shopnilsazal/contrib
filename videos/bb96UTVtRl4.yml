description: "In this 2017 GDC talk, Treachery in Breakdown City creator Shawn Allen explains how he approached creating dozens of characters of various ethnic groups in a fictional New York, and how he too has stumbled on his way, in order to help other game developers add black and brown characters to their games without creating bad representations.  \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
