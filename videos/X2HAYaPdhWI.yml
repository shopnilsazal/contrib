description: "Turning Google Earth into SimCity 2000! (From Light to Pixels to Impossible Perspectives!) by Logan Williams\n\nRemember isometric games, like SimCity 2000 and Q*bert? Real life sadly doesn’t look like Q*bert, and it’s mostly because parallel lines converge! Why does this happen? We’ll use simple geometric rules to explain how cameras turn light, a five-dimensional (!) spatial variable, into a pattern of pixels. With computers, we can algorithmically alter that pattern, and synthesize impossible perspectives from real data. (Including some inspired by your retro-gaming faves!) Finally, we’ll discuss how image formation models might change the way we think about the world around us!"
