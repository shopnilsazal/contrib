title: 'From a model to production like a Pro: Software-engineering Best-Practices - Marcel Krƒçah'

description: "Description\nAfter an initial data-science proof-of-concept is completed, it often needs to be professionalized and deployed to production. Underestimating this step often leads to higher maintenance and slower time-to-market of new features. In this talk we will cover a set of practical software-engineering best-practices for industrializing a machine-learning model to help minimize such problems.\n\nAbstract\nAfter an initial data-science proof-of-concept is completed, it often needs to be professionalized and deployed to production. Underestimating this step often leads to higher maintenance and slower time-to-market of new features. In this talk we will cover a set of practical software-engineering best-practices for industrializing a machine-learning model to help minimize such problems.\n\nAfter this talk, you will know how to develop and run a professional data-science application in production like a pro. Among others, we will cover topics like:\n\noptimal deployment pipeline (automate all the things),\nDocker (no more \"Works on my machine\")\nteam-collaboration (pull-requests for the win, no more bus-factor of one),\napplication & log monitoring (a.k.a \"those graphs on that monitor look impressive. Is that real-time?\"),\nconfiguration (one ring to rule them all) ,\nREST APIs (\"I don't care how it's implemented, just give me the endpoint\"),\nand more (e.g. useful Slack notification)\nThe talk is based on my 10-year experience as a software-engineer and all the stuff I have learnt about developing and deploying software applications during this time.\n\nThis talk is suitable for everyone responsible for running a data-science model in production environments.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
