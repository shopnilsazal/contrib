description: 'The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is taking over our lives, so we should be constantly questioning the security and integrity of these technologies. As an IoT researcher, this is precisely what I do. During this presentation, I will be sharing details of my day-to-day research, covering the various processes and methodologies around researching (attacking) various IoT technologies that we all use every day. I will be discussing the various structures of an IoT ecosystem and showing how each segment of that ecosystem can be compromised to impact the overall security of a product. Using live demonstration, I will show several of the security issues discovered during my research over the past 12 months and how we worked with the manufacturers to get these issues mitigated.'
