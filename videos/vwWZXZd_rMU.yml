title: 'The Agile Enterprise - Adopting Agile Application Delivery - Andi Gutmans - Forum PHP 2013'
recordingDate: 1386771817
description: "In this session, Andi will talk about how the changing landscape is impacting enterprise development and what it means to achieve agile application delivery. He will address a key question -- while we are all familiar with the concepts and methods of agile development, how do we take that same mindset and approach, and apply it to the end to end delivery of our applications? Specifically how do we deliver our apps all the way to the market with a rapid, iterative and collaborative approach?\n\nAndi will place a focus on what it truly takes for a company to achieve agile delivery- from development through to production, and will share new developer tools, practices and innovations. He will address the practicalities of API --centric application design, and discuss how to implement Continuous Delivery- and key steps towards automation of the application delivery cycle.\n\nhttps://joind.in/talk/view/9787"
