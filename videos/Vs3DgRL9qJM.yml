description: "Description from DEF CON 9 Speakerâ€™s Page: \nDesigning small payloads\n\nThis talk presents how to use double injection over an existing network connection to write small remote buffer overflow exploits. A number of practical tips and code examples will be given. It will also be explained how this design can be used to hide an attack from both network based and host based intrusion detection systems.\n\nAnders Ingeborn works with vulnerability assessment and penetration tests at iXsecurity in Sweden. iXsecurity's clients during the last couple of years include government agencies, banks, nuclear power plants and major corporations throughout Scandinavia. Anders also holds a MS in computer security."
