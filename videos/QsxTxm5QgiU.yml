description: "Plumbing the Cloud for Containers - Michael Friis, Docker\n\n\"Container platforms and orchestration systems are becoming easier to setup and install, but setting up a production container system or even a PoC can be challenging.\n\nIn this talk, Michael Friis will introduce you to inner workings of Docker for AWS and Docker for Azure, two systems build by Docker for deploying and maintaining swarms on cloud infrastructure.\n\nCome to this talk to learn what it takes to install and maintain easy-to-use container platforms on public clouds and to better under tradeoffs when choosing loadbalancers, logging and storage solutions. You'll leave this talk with ideas for how to better set up your cloud container solution and with a better understanding of how Docker for AWS and Azure are configured and used.\"\n\nAbout Michael Friis\nMichael is a product manager at Docker where he works on Docker for AWS and Azure, and tries to make Docker work with Microsoft technology. Previously he was at Heroku and before that AppHarbor, a .NET platform as a service. He built early Mono/.NET Docker images, since adopted by Mono and Docker as an official language stack. He helps Microsoft maintain their official ASP.NET Docker repo."
