description: 'You know how to raise and rescue exceptions. But do you know how they work, and how how to structure a robust error handling strategy for your app? This talk starts with a technical deep dive into Ruby''s exception facility, covering features, tricks, and gotchas you never knew about. You''ll learn how to retry failed operations; how to override "raise" for fun and profit; and advanced techniques for matching exceptions in rescue clauses. From there, we''ll move on to patterns and guidelines for structuring a robust, failure-resilient codebase. We''ll look at strategies for avoiding failure cascades; how to characterize and verify the exception-safety of critical methods; and alternatives to raising exceptions for when "fail fast" isn''t the right answer. Finally, you''ll learn about the three exception classes every app needs.'
