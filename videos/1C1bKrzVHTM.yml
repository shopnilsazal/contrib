description: "Find more information here: http://15.droidcon.de/session/connecting-bean-bumpy-road-bluetooth-low-energy-android\n\nConnecting smart, low energy peripherals using Bluetooth Low Energy seems easy enough; the devices and API’s are available since Android 4.3, but only until you start using those API’s you’ll encounter strange, undocumented and sometimes surprising details. In this session I’ll talk about Android BLE and the particularities of it, by taking the experience and learnings of building the unofficial SDK for the LightBlue Bean. This session will cover what BLE is, the key API’s involved and will highlight tips, tricks and issues for each API."
