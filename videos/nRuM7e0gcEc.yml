description: "Pyr0 - FAQ the Kiddies\n\nEvery year the attendance at Defcon grows. It was apparent this last year that many of the Kiddies (W@r3z d00d5, Script Kiddies, and lamers) had come with the intention of learning something. Problem is upon arrival these groups think that the only way they will be able to benefit from Defcon is if they \"PROVE THEMSELF\" to everybody they come across. By the end of Day 1 they have successfully burned any bridge they had the chance of building. This speech will give newbies some of the info needed to get on \"the right track\". \nSome of the highlights are:\n\nDangers of being a script kiddie\nLearning vs. Compiling \nWhat your local library has to offer \"Follow the rainbow booked road\"\n\"Hacking without going to jail\"\n\"Shutting your mouth and opening your ears\"\nThere will be many URL's and book titles given so please bring a pen and paper. \n\nDEF CON 8.0 was held July 28th - 30th, 2000, in Las Vegas, Nevada USA"
