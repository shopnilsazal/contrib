description: "by Ernie Miller\nAgile. Scrum. Kanban. Waterfall. TDD. BDD. OOP. FP. AOP. WTH?\nAs a software developer, I can adopt methodologies so that I feel there’s a sense of order in the world.\nThere’s a problem with this story: We are humans, developing software with humans, to benefit humans. And humans are messy.\nWe wrap ourselves in process, trying to trade people for personas, points, planning poker, and the promise of predictability. Only people aren’t objects to be abstracted away. Let’s take some time to think through the tradeoffs we’re making together.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GWId/"
