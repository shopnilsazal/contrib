title: 'GeeCON Prague 2017: Thompson/Montgomery - Design process behind the fastest Messaging System'
recordingDate: 1516816492
description: 'Have you ever wondered what is the design process when someone designs a new software system that is faster than anything that has gone before? In this talk we will explore some of the key design decisions which lead to Aeron having the best throughput and latency in the messaging space. Sometimes this is going against common wisdom like having to choose between throughput or latency. Sometimes the focus on a new feature can open opportunities not previously considered. You may also think that since you don''t work in high frequency trading that you don''t need high-performance messaging. We''ll wrap up with some examples outside of finance that have benefited from high-performance messaging with surprising results.'
