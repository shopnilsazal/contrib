description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #9\n18 October 2017\nSponsored by Salesforce and hosted by Campus Tel Aviv\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nClustering before labeling / Uri Goren, Yahoo - Document classification algorithms requires labels, and tagging may be costly. We will demonstrate a simple method for saving money by applying agglomerative clustering techniques on the raw data.\n\nCreating Beautiful Interactive Reports Automatically in HTML / Omri Allouche, Gong.io -Presenting analysis results in a clear and inviting way is often as important as the analysis details itself. In the talk I'll show how to create beautiful interactive reports that load on any device (including mobile devices) without the need for software installation, by using the Jinja2\n\nExplainable Machine Learning - How to explain model predictions to customers / Erez Agami, Salesforce - One of the challenges encountered in many machine learning projects is how to make the customers trust the predictions. Providing an explanation why the model gave certain predictions can help build trust. We will talk about how we dealt with the problem in some of our projects in Salesforce and what lessons we learned.\n\nOversampling Techniques and Applications in Python / Liron Hayman, Intuit - Classification models typically see improvements when classes are artificially made balanced. We will cover the SMOTE and ADASYN methods and their variations. Specifically, we will show the performance of these methods through examples using the imbalanced-learn Python library developed by Lemaitre, Nogueira and Aridas.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
