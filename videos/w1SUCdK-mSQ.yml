description: "by Gerolf Ziegenhain\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nHow can Open Source Software and safety critical systems work together? DFSGmbH relies on Linux for its core air traffic control systems. We havesuccessfully managed to standardize a highly reliable, modular operatingsystem and hardware platform at DFS.\n\nIn a brief overview we explain the challenges, technical and non-technicalones, we have faced getting to the modular platforms. What approaches did wetake and why? Which ones did work out in the long end? We will cover a broadrange of aspects ranging from hardware life cycles, application lifecycles,regulations, deployment solutions, user acceptance, cost cutting and testing.\n\n\nRoom: Janson\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 16:00:00"
