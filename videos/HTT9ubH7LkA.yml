description: "Dealing with AI as a Dystopian Threat to Humanity\nWe have seen how emergent AI could attack the humanity without a warning - either to terminate it or enslave it. How realistic are such sci fi scenarios in our future? How can they be avoided? In this presentation, we argue that the humanity's evolutionary obsession with survival has deep roots and teaches us to rely on the physical world when addressing grave threats. We propose a set of rules and constraints on AI to limit its destructive potential. We also point out that defending the humanity may become more difficult as technology changes who we are."
