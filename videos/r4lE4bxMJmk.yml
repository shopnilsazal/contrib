title: 'Schemaless SQL - The Best of Both Worlds'
recordingDate: 1347845733
description: "Schemaless database are a joy to use because they make it easy to iterate on your app, especially early on. The relational model isn't always the best fit for evolving and messy data in the real world. And let's be honestâ€”it's painful to persist rich domain models across millions of little tables. However as your data model stabilizes, the lack of well-defined schemas becomes painful. On the other hand, relational databases are proven, robust, and powerful. How are we supposed to pick one or the other? Simple: pick both.\n\nRecent advances in Postgres allow for a new hybrid approach. The hstore datatype brings key/value pairs to Postgres, and PLV8 embeds the super-fast V8 JavaScript engine into Postgres. These in turn make Postgres the best document database in the world. This talk will explore when and how to take advantage of them, and how we use these techniques at Heroku.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGg7/"
