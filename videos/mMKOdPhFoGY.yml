description: "Invisible Access: Electronic Access Control, Audit Trails and \"High Security\"\nMarc Weber Tobias Investigative Attorney and Security Specialist, Security.org\nMatt Fiddler Security Specialist, Security.org\nTobias Bluzmanis Security Specialist, Security.org\n\nThis presentation will include a detailed review regarding the protection of high security facilities, including airports and aircraft, power transmission facilities, and data center rooms. The emphasis will be on liability and security issues that may result from an undue reliance on certain high security locking systems and the resulting Audit Logs that may not even exist. We will discuss a number of misconceptions and why these facilities may be at risk, even with some of the most sophisticated physical and electronic access control hardware and software.\n\nSpecific problems inherent in conventional locking hardware will be the primary focus, together with an analysis of high security mechanical locks and electronic access control systems produced by many of the Assa Abloy companies. These technologies include the Cliq, Logic, and NexGen among others. The representations of certain manufacturers will be analyzed, and potential vulnerabilities in these high-tech systems will be explored, together with the liability that may flow to users if these systems are circumvented.\n\nSince the publication of OPEN IN THIRTY SECONDS , which details the compromise of Medeco high security locks (2008), intensive research has been on-going in the U.S. and Europe regarding the security of different electronic access control systems.\n\nMarc Weber Tobias is an investigative attorney and security specialist living in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
