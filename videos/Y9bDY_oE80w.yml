Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11–13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14–15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nNATS Intro – Colin Sullivan & Waldemar Quevedo, Synadia (Any Skill Level)\n\nJoin members of the NATS team to learn about NATS Messaging! Distributed systems architecture has been disrupted via decomposition as cloud technology has matured - a move from monolithic applications to microservices. This has created a need for multiple communication patterns, location transparency, and the decoupling of data producers and consumers. NATS is a cloud-native messaging project that addresses these needs and others. In this discussion, we'll introduce you to NATS: how NATS came to be, it's DNA, the problems it solves and how NATS can be leveraged in cloud applications.\n\nAbout Colin\nColin is the product manager of NATS (https://nats.io). He has extensive experience developing messaging products and designing distributed systems. Prior to Synadia, Colin worked at Apcera and TIBCO software.\n\nAbout Waldemar\nWaldemar is a Software Engineer at Synadia Communications, Inc, working on NATS (@nats_io)"
