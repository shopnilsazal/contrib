description: "by Sven Finke\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nBugs, corrupt data or performance issues on web applications are oftenrecognized far too late. In the worst case they are reported by the customer,so they probably have already done some serious damage - frustrated the user,made them lose trust or even corrupted their data. Finding these bugs orrecognizing them early gets especially hard, if your application makes heavyuse of background processes, daemons or cronjobs. They might even throwexceptions that are buried somewhere in the logs, and no one will ever beaware of them, until someone has a look into the log files.\n\nI want to show a way out of this misery and provide different solutions inform of practical examples. These will include different levels of monitoring- from simple text logs on the servers up to a fully monitored applicationincluding hardware monitoring, extensive metrics, indexed and searchable logsof the whole environment, performance analysis and alerts if something oddhappens. I'll show different examples and give ideas when such a fullymonitored solution is a good idea, or when a \"light monitoring\" is applicable.\n\n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:00:00"
