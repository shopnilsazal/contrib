description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://gsec.hitb.org/materials/sg2015/\n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\nZero-day vulnerabilities are gaining a prominent role in the modern-day intelligence, national security, and law enforcement operations. At the same time, trading vulnerability information or zero-day exploits is considered a risky ordeal. Players in the secretive zero-day market face some inherent obstacles related to time-sensitiveness of traded commodities, trust, price fairness, and possibility of defection.\n\nTo alleviate some of these hurdles, it was suggested to:\n\n1. Use punishment (i.e., public disclosure of vulnerabilities) to discourage a buyer from defecting;\n\n2. Resort to the use of trusted-third parties (e.g., escrow services), as crucial entities for enabling cooperation of market participants; and\n\n3. Build a reputation system (e.g., reputation score) as an instrument to establish trust relationships between distrustful players.\n\nThis work presents the first results of an ongoing study on extortion and cooperation in zero-day markets through the lens of game theory.\n\nThe questions motivating this research are: a. Can the zero-day market achieve cooperation and efficiency even in absence of trusted-third parties? b. Can punishment discourage the buyer from defecting? c. Under which conditions a player can extort the opponent? d. Can cooperation be sustained also in fully anonymous or semi-anonymous settings? The talk will address these questions and others, by providing an analysis of the zero-day trading strategies applicable to each scenario.\n\nLearn which strategies allows to maximize the profits while trading zero-days in today’s marketplaces. Find out how to avoid getting extorted by zero–day traders. Learn how to extort an unwit market participant. Gain a deeper knowledge about the emergence, sustainability, and breakdown of cooperation. Discover under which conditions the zero-day markets can achieve efficiency.\n\nABOUT ALFONSO DE GREGORIO\n\nAlfonso De Gregorio is a security technologist, founder of BeeWise, the first cyber security prediction market, and Principal Consultant at secYOUre.
