recordingDate: 1473199812
description: "2nd\_Day Operations: Your Checklist for Cloud Native World\n\nAccording to a June 2016 report from the Cloud Foundry Foundation, 16% of enterprises are\nalready using containers in production, and another 64% are looking to move into production\nwith containers in the coming year. This massive shift is fueling enterprises to architect and build their next generation applications on several core cloud native principles, including microservices in containers with open source frameworks for analytics and big data.\n\nBut building cloud native applications is only half of the challenge. It isn’t until you start running them at scale, dealing with outages and making upgrades that you see the full picture. These are the challenges of 2nd Day Operations, challenges that you do not want to actually bump into for the first time on day two of a production rollout. Navigating your way through a cloud native journey means making sure you’ve considered your 2nd Day Operations plan from the very beginning.\n\nIn this talk, Mesosphere’s Ben Hindman will share his 2nd Day Operations checklist for cloud native apps. These are the critical challenges you’ll want to be prepared for, and the surprising realizations that you do not want to be surprised by. He’ll also share his advice from years as a leader in the cloud native movement, working on the front lines with 2nd day operators around the world."
