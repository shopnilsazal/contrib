description: "Ruby Safari by: Ola Bini\n\nThere are many strange beasts in the Ruby language. Some of them you might never have seen. Others you might have seen but not understood.\nRuby is a big language, and this presentation will show you some of the corners of Ruby that you might not have known about, or even dared think would exist in a modern language. Some of these features are useful, some of them are useless and some of them are just downright puzzling. Come here to get a tasting of the weirder parts of Ruby."
