recordingDate: 1482404048
description: "Sebastian Witalec    \nTechnical Evangelist for Progress/Telerik\n\nSebastian Witalec is a Technical Evangelist for Progress/Telerik with over 8 years of experience in software engineering and architecture. Sebastian has passion for all types of technologies. However in the last few years his focus shifted towards cross platform Mobile development where he gained experience with Apache Cordova and NativeScript. He is always happy to learn about the new stuff and to pass the knowledge as far as his voice (or the wire) can take him. Sebastian is based in London, UK actively working with various Dev communities in the area. When not acting techie he is a massive football fan/player (probably bigger at heart than skills).\n\n\nBuilding a robot app with NativeScript\nNativeScript is an open source cross platform framework that lets you build mobile apps with 100% native UI, however it is not limited to just building sleek and beautiful apps. Its versatility lets us go beyond the boundaries of a mobile screen and enter the cyber brain of a MiP robot. \nIn this talk you will see how to establish a connection with MiP robot (close cousin to T-800) and how to create a NativeScript remote controller to move the robot around the stage. To do that we will use the MiP BLE Protocol to communicate with the machine via Bluetooth. \nYou can expect to see a real robot controlled with a NativeScript app. After the session I will share the code with you, so that you could get your own robot to protect your desk at work."
