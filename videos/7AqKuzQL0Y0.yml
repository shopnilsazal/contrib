description: "Since we've seen the ActiveModel Extravaganza, it is now time for the, \"The ActiveSupport Three - It is finally getting interesting.\" In this spectacle, Bryan Liles will highlight some of the more interesting features of ActiveSupport 3, while showing how you can use it write better (looking) Ruby code. A special emphasis will be placed on the new sections, but some of our old friends we've known for years will definitely get their time in the spotlight. Highlights from this talk will include Concerns, Load Paths, and other fun topics.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FNjz/"
