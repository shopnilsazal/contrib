Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nIntroduction to Istio Configuration - Joy Zhang, Google (Beginner Skill Level)\n\nIstio is an open platform that allows the operator to turn workloads into \"services\" by intent-driven configurations without rewriting/redeploying them. Istio configuration provides the operators central controls to these diverse workloads regardless of what environments they run in, or where they run. In this talk, we introduce how Istio configuration is designed to meet the goals of an easy-to-use schema, access controlled API, and performant system components at scale. We cover the automations Istio provides to ease a wide range of operators' tasks on multi-environment deployments, such as configuration authoring, configuration resource life-cycle management, monitored and safe configuration distribution.\n\nAbout Joy\nJoy is a software engineer at Google and a technical lead of the Istio Config Working Group. She also contributes to Istio service broker and Istio integrations. Prior to that, she spent 10+ years in software development and research across a variety of areas: mobile clients, data analytics, and optical networks. Joy received her PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. She currently lives in Kirkland, Washington with her husband and 3 kids."
