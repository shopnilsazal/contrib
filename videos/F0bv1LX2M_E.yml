title: 'Reusable Cross-Platform Frameworks with Kotlin/Native by Simone Civetta, Xebia IT Architects EN'

description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Simone Civetta, Xebia IT Architects.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-42\n\nWhile building entire cross-platform apps might often turn out to be a bad idea, mission-critical client-specific logic can greatly benefit from an unique codebase, allowing code to be written - and tested - once. Since end 2016, Kotlin/Native can compile Kotlin code to a binary form, which can be embedded into a native app. In this talk you will learn why it makes sense, and how, to leverage these experimental features and build a cross-platform module reusable on both Android and iOS.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
