description: "by Raymond Knopp\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThis talk will provide an overview of the evolution of OAI architecture tocater to distributed software radio systems, in particular thosecharacteristics of upcoming cellular networks.\n\nThis talk was moved forwards 1 hour from its original timeslot (16:45).\n\nThe evolution of radio communication networks will soon include by so-called“CloudRAN” technologies which refer to centralized radio-access infrastructuredeployed in data-centers. Although exhibiting important differences in thetype of processing they perform, the compute and storage architecture of thesedata-centers, as well as many of the software technologies, are very muchmodelled by those used by internet-based industries for information contentmanagement and distribution.\n\nThe future network architecture is comprised of three segments, the so-calledfronthaul network, the CloudRAN data-centers and the main data-centers. Thefronthaul network links the radio nodes at the extremities with the CloudRAN.These interconnection networks are typically optical links over very largedistances (10-20 km) when the CloudRAN resides in the central office of anoperator. Various technologies are envisaged including analog (radio-over-fiber) PON (passive optical network), TDM and WDM PON and carrier gradeoptical Ethernet. Other solutions will also exist for indoor networks (e.g.airports, shopping malls, large administrations, private enterprise networks,etc.) using both optical and copper-based fronthaul networks.\n\nThe software architecture of OpenAirInterface (OAI) is currently being evolvedto cater to these distributed processing environments. In particular theinfrastructure processing elements in OAI are being split at various places toallow them to be distributed between the central cloud processing units (RCC),the so-called radio-aggregation units (RAU) which perform centralized signalprocessing and switching and the network of remote-radio units (RRU). OAI nowcomprises two such processing splits which will be detailed along withexamples of how to build simple ethernet-based RRU with low-cost commodityradio equipment (e.g. USRP B2x0, LimeSDR, etc.) and embedded PCs or ARM-basedcomputers. In addition, The current architecture for deploying OAI in a data-center environment will be described.\n\nA short live demonstration of networked-signal processing for 4G will beprovided comprising a USRP-based RRU running on an UPBoard, an ethernetfronthaul and a mini radio-cloud-center housing the access protocol stack anda small core network.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 14:45:00"
