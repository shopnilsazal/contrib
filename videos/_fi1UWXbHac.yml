description: "The crowdsourced security model has been embraced by organizations running bug bounty programs. These programs are intended to discover and resolve vulns in production applications, but too often they deviate from an effective part of the security development lifecycle into a source of noise. This presentation questions what role such programs have in improving security and the pitfalls they pose for security budgets. It covers strategies for keeping a program focused on positive, risk-based contributions to development and avoiding the traps that make it a distraction.\n\nThe presentation also explores what the emergence of bounty programs implies about trends in appsec automation and where major gaps remain. Tools must remain part of any crowdsourced security model. From budgeting to communications, there are more challenges to building a useful appsec program than just determining whether a bug exists.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
