title: 'DEF CON 15 - Aaron Peterson - Pen Testing Wi fi'
recordingDate: 1391561709
description: "Aaron Peterson: Pen-testing Wi-Fi\nAs wi-fi becomes increasingly popular and as more layers of access control are added, the fact that a wireless access point exists becomes less interesting to us. The problem is that manually going through a long list of access points checking for interesting information is tedious at best.\n\nWicrawl is a tool that will allow you to \"crawl\" through discovered access points with a series of plugins that implement common tools (nmap, aircrack, etc) to find the accessible, interesting, or relevant ones. This can help with penetration testing, detecting rogue access points, or maybe just finding free internet access. We recently revamped wicrawl to be more targeted towards penetration testing adding a new reporting infrastructure as well as accelerated hardware support, and this will be released at Defcon. A wi-fi finding robot will also make its debut!\n\nAaron will give a guided tour of this new utility and its capabilities, as well as the plugins. A live demo of wicrawl will be shown. We'll hand out free liveCDs that include the software!\n\nAaron Peterson Aaron is the founder of Midnight Research Laboratories, a computer security research group based in the San Francisco bay area with members in several US cities. He is the project leader and a developer for wicrawl. By day he works on the Harvard University network security incident response team, and by night does security consulting and penetration testing with Alpha Defense."
