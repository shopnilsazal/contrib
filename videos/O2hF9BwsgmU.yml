description: "By Luc Verhaegen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 years after the modular X tree was released, we can clearly see that we did not fully satisfy all expectations and that we are really holding the free software desktop back.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, the current situation gets analysed, and the next step, providing more integrated graphics driver stacks, a change that will make life easier for all involved, is introduced and demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
