recordingDate: 1383153638
description: "Hacking [Redacted] Routers\nFX Leader, Phenoelit Group, Recurity Labs\nGreg Recurity Labs\n\n[Redacted] routers are no longer devices only seen in [Redacted]. Entire countries run their Internet infrastructure exclusively on these products and established tier 1 ISPs make increasing use of them. However, very little is known of [Redacted]'s Software Platform and its security. This presentation will introduce the architecture, special properties of configurations and services as well as how to reverse engineer the OS. Obviously, this is done only to ensure compatibility with router products of other vendors ;) Routers might be still hurt in the process.\n\nFX is the leader of the Phenoelit group and loves to hack pretty much everything with a CPU and some communication, preferably networked. He looks back at around fifteen years of (legal) hacking with only a couple Cisco IOS and SAP remote exploits, tools for hacking HP printers and protocol attacks lining the road.\n\nIn his day life, FX runs Recurity Labs GmbH, a security consulting and research company in Berlin, Germany.\nTwitter: @41414141\n\nGreg joined the Recurity Labs team early 2008. Prior to Recurity Labs, Greg worked as a freelancer for a number of large customers. Greg is experienced in source code audits, black box analysis and reverse engineering. Furthermore, Greg also performs software/system design work at Recurity Labs. Greg works on various internal research projects, where he applies his taste for cryptography."
