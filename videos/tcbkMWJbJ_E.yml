description: "Classic Applications in a Confined Ecosystem Using libertine to run deb-packaged, X11 applications in an all-snaps Ubuntu\nby Larry Price (larryprice)\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nLibertine is an application suite for installing and running classicapplications in a confined environment. Using libertine allows us to useeveryday applications which have not been ported over to a new packagingformat or don't work natively with a new display server. Libertine has allowedus to take advantage of classic apps such as Firefox and LibreOffice in UbuntuTouch, a version of Ubuntu for devices based on click packaging andMir/Unity8. Ubuntu developers have recently unveiled snappy, a new kind ofpackaging system which keeps an application confined to a readonly filesystemwith all of its dependencies managed internally. Since migrating applicationsto snaps is a manual process, we've been working on a libertine snap to giveus the ability to use non-snap applications in an all-snaps Ubuntu.\n\nThis lecture will start with an overview of why libertine is a necessarycomponent for managing and launching deb-based applications on both a classicMir/Unity8 system and a completely confined all-snaps Ubuntu. Then there willbe a review of how libertine works in general through container management andapplication launching. Finally, these topics will come together with anexplanation of the infrastructure required for libertine to operate in an all-snaps environment. There will be light code and tooling examples throughout,as well as a live demonstration of deb-based X applications running in a snapenvironment.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:00:00"
