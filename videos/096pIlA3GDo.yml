description: "Core.Async has been out for several years. However there’s been very few talks or materials that dig into the ways to use and not use this library. Should we save core.async for specific situations, or include it on every project by default? And how does CSP fit into Clojure’s view of pragmatic functional programming?\n\nTimothy can normally be found hacking on some sort of compiler or other computer language related tech. He’s been developing in Clojure for over six years and works for Cognitect as a Software Engineer."
