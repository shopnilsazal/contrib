description: "RubyConf 2016 - Bootcamp Grads Have Feelings, Too by Megan Tiu\n\nYou’re a bootcamp student. You’re so excited to become a developer! Amidst your excitement about this new industry, you hear everyone say that bootcamps are a blemish on the community, that they’re a waste of time and money. “Maybe I’ve made a huge mistake,” you think. “I don’t know how I’ll fit in here.\"\n\nBut you can make this community better! In this session, you’ll learn about the varied experiences of bootcamp students and grads, how exclusionary behavior can end up stunting our community as a whole, and what you can to do make a more inclusive environment for everyone of all skill levels."
