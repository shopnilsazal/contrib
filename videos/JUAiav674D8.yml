title: '#HITB2016AMS CommSec Track D1 - Applying Regulatory Data to IoT/RF Reverse Engineering - Marc Newlin'
recordingDate: 1466056340
description: "IoT devices frequently include obscure RF transceivers with little or no documentation, which can hinder the reverse engineering research process. Fortunately, regulatory bodies like the United Statesâ€™ FCC contain a wealth of useful information.\n\nIn order to certify wireless devices for sale in different markets, manufacturers must submit their products to test labs which evaluate the behavior of their RF emissions. The test reports often contain detailed physical layer operating characteristics, including RF channels, modulation, and frequency hopping behavior.\n\nBy translating regulatory test reports into GNU Radio flow graphs, a researcher is able to focus their efforts on understanding packet formats and protocol behavior instead of grinding away at the physical layer. In this talk, I will discuss the techniques I used while researching the MouseJack vulnerabilities, which allowed me to expedite the process of evaluating a large number of vulnerable devices.\n\n======\n\nMarc is a security researcher on the RFStorm threat research team at Bastille, where he focuses on RF/IoT threats present in enterprise environments. He has been hacking on software defined radios since 2013, when he competed as a finalist in the DARPA Spectrum Challenge. In 2011, he wrote software to reassemble shredded documents for the DARPA Shredder Challenge, finishing the competition in third place out of 9000 teams."
