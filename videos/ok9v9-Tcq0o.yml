description: "Building for Accessibility by Nathan Hammond\n\nThe advent of JavaScript applications means that we need to make sure we evolve our thinking on how to develop accessible experiences on top of the web platform. Just as we no longer design static visual experiences and instead plan for motion in our applications we also need to spend the same intentionality designing and building experiences for users of assistive technology.\nYouâ€™ll leave this talk with a few techniques you can bring to your applications tomorrow and hopefully a new approach to thinking about building web applications.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GmtC/"
