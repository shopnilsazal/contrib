description: 'Enabling better communications between geeks and management. As humans, we have had 60,000 years to perfect communication, but those of us working in IT, regardless of which side (Blue or Red Team), still struggle with this challenge. We have done our best over the centuries to yell "FIRE!" in a manner befitting our surroundings, yet today we seem utterly incapable of providing that very basic communication capability inside organizations. This talk will endeavor to explain HOW we can yell "FIRE!" and other necessary things across the enterprise in a language both leadership, managers and end-users understand.'
