recordingDate: 1525970199
description: 'Lynn Root is a Site Reliability Engineer at Spotify; but in reality, she tends to break things rather than make them more reliable. Lynn is also a global leader of PyLadies, and the founder & former leader of the San Francisco PyLadies. When her hands are not on a keyboard, they are usually holding a pair of knitting needles.'
