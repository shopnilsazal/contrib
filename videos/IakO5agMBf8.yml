description: "We asked the 2017 GDCA and IGF nominees for fun facts about their game---some of them were so surprising, we figured we'd share some of the best ones with you. (Note, this video ran on a pre-show loop for the GDCA and IGF ceremony, so there's no audio on it.)\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
