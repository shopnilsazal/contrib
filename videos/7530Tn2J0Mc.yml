recordingDate: 1494854746
description: "Filmed at PyData London 2017\nwww.pydata.org\n\nDescription\nThere are many ways to find similar words/docs with an open-source Natural Language processing library Gensim that I maintain. I will give an overview of modern word embeddings like Google's Word2vec, Facebook's FastText, GloVe, WordRank, VarEmbed and discuss what business tasks fit them best.\n\nAbstract\nWhat is the most similar word to \"king\"? It depends on what you mean by similar. \"King\" can be interchanged with \"Canute\", but it's attribute is \"crown\". We will discuss how to achieve these two kinds of similarity from word embeddings. Also touch on how to deal with the common issues of rare, frequent and out of vocabulary words.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
