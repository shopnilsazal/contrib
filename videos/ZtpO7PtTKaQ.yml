description: "What does GraphQL and Traditional REST API have in common? Shouldn't the GraphQL be connected to some graphs or similar? What is actually GraphQL all about?\n\nJoin me in this talk, while I try to answer all this questions and much more.\n\nIn this talk I will explain what GraphQL is, what are differences and similarities compared to more traditional REST API and show you this on working examples, since code worth more then words only ;)"
