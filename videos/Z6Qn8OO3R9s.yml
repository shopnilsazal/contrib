Code samples have been published and conference sessions were held. Questions on forums were asked and answered. Bugs were raised and triaged.\n\nThis session doesn’t cover anything of the above, but will show my approach when migrating the Topeka sample to an instant app with multiple, independent feature modules and what I learned. Topeka is a non-trivial sample application with custom sign in, animations, transitions and several Activities and Fragments.\n\nI’ll talk about the steps I took and explain the rationale behind them. This will enable you to experiment with Android Instant Apps until you feel your instant app is ready for deployment to production. If you're experimenting with instant apps, you'll have enough to get started and to make a demo for your team. If you're committed to making an instant app, you'll learn how to reduce friction during the refactoring while still maintaining a cod\n\n Alex Karp Production"
