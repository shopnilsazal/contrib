title: '#HITB2016AMS - D2T1 - Forging a Wireless Time Signal to Attack NTP Servers - Y. Zheng & H. Shan'
recordingDate: 1466840177
description: "Radio timing service, such as GPS, BPC, JJY, WWVB, DCF77, WWVH have been widely used as a basic time source for industry or individual systems. These signals are used by millions of people to synchronize consumer electronic products like wall clocks, clock radios, and wristwatches. NTP sever also use these signals to get a precise time.\n\nIn this presentation we show how these signals can be forged with a low cost circuit. If hackers take this device to the target region and emit the fake signal, people who use clocks or watches that synchronize these signals would be disrupted. In addition, NTP servers that uses radio timing service as a reference clock can also be easily attacked by spoofing the fake timing signal.\n\nConsumer devices that use these wireless signals to adjust time affected by this attack including Casio, Citizen and Garmin watches that use low frequency signals and GPS signals to synchronize time automatically.  For industrial applications, a lot of NTP server products including Meinbergâ€™s Stratum 1 NTP server are affected. All internet devices synchronized with this server will fall into chaos.\n\n======\n\nYuwei Zheng is a senior security researcher concentrated in embedded systems over 10 years.  He had reversed blackberry BBM, PIN, BIS push mail protocol, and decrypted the network stream successfully in 2011. A year later, he finished a MITM attack for Blackberry BES  based on a modified ECMQV protocol of RIM. At the end of 2014, he joined the Qihoo wireless security research group, Unicorn Team. Now he is focusing on the security issues of embedded hardware and IOT systems. He was the speaker of DEFCON 23 giving a presentation on building a free cellular traffic capture tool with a vxworks based femoto.\n\n-----\n\nHaoqi Shan is currently a wireless/hardware security researcher in Unicorn Team.  He focuses on Wi-Fi penetration, GSM system, router/switcher hacking etc. Other research interests include mobile phone application security, reverse engineering on embedded devices such as femto-cell base station, video cameras."
