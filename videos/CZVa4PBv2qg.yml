title: 'GeeCON 2017: Nikita Lipsky - JIT vs. AOT: Unity And Conflict of Dynamic and Static Compilers'
recordingDate: 1502695042
description: 'Java had been constantly criticized for poor performance ever since its inception, but not so much in recent years. Thanks to optimizing dynamic native code compilers, Java performance today is very close to the performance of low level languages ​​such as C/C++, and is even better on some classes of applications. Along with dynamic compilers, static compilers for Java have been evolving as well, so there is still no clear winner among these two approaches. It should then come as no surprise that an AOT compiler is finally going to appear even in the HotSpot JVM and OpenJDK via JEP-295, which is officially included in Java 9.'
