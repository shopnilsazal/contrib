description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nKeynote: CERN Experiences with Multi-Cloud Federated Kubernetes - Ricardo Rocha, Staff Member, CERN & Clenimar Filemon, Software Engineer, Federal University of Campina Grande\n\nUsing public cloud resources to cover for peak workloads is a practical and economical alternative to over provisioning on-premise resources. This is the case in environments like CERN where its large internal computing infrastructure is usually big enough but where periods prior to big international conferences or large event reconstruction campaigns see a significant spike in the amount of workloads submitted. We will describe early experiences relying on Kubernetes federations to expand the available capacity to external clouds, while still offering a single entry point to our users - using GKE, AKS, Amazon and the Oracle cloud. We will cover some issues we had in some of the clouds (mainly networking) and how we solved them. We will show how they get integrated with our main batch system, and how workloads running on external resources access their corresponding datasets.\n\n\"About Ricardo\nRicardo is a software engineer at CERN currently part of the CERN cloud team, focusing primarily on networking and container based deployments. Previously he helped develop and deploy several components of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid, a network of ~200 collaborating sites around the world helping to analyze the Large Hadron Collider data. Ricardo has presented his and his teams work in different international conferences - Computing for High Energy Physics (CHEP), IEEE NSS/MIC, IEEE MSST, DockerCon and multiple OpenStack summits.\n\nAbout Clenimar\nClenimar is an MSc student at the Federal University of Campina Grande, Brazil. He is currently researching on distributed, secure workloads in the cloud (using OpenStack and Kubernetes). He spent last summer working at CERN as a Cloud Infrastructure Intern, where he could investigate on how Kubernetes federations could match some CERN use cases, especially regarding the CERN batch service."
