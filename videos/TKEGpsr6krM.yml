title: 'GeeCON Prague 2017: Sebastian Carroll - Agile Data with Apache Nifi'
recordingDate: 1516816493
description: 'Principles of Agile are starting to move outside of the realm of software development into many other aspects of business. This is also expanding into the world of Data Management. One very important and poorly understood section of data management is data in motion. Data being moved is traditionally hard to track and the systems that do this are either rigid and inflexible or custom, complex and difficult to maintain. Apache NiFi specialises in moving data in a way that is simple and easy to change, with a number of features that improve data security, visibility and governance. In the session I will introduce Apache NiFi application to some common scenarios and show how it works with some awesome demos.'
