description: "PyCon Canada 2015: https://2015.pycon.ca/en/schedule/38/\n\nTalk Description:\nWe will explore ways of detecting fraud in a stream of data. In a stream of data we want to make sure that we won't receive too many requests from the same source or we might be curious about finding a specific pattern. \nIn this talk we will see how Spark can help us with the help of probabilistic data structures."
