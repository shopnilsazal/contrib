description: "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nThere is an abundance of easily mineable text data (Whatsapp, twitter, and even our own e-mails!), and we have no excuse to not analyse it. In this workshop, we will learn some tips and tricks to deal with messy text data, before moving on to some lesser looked at text analysis techniques, such as text summarisation, working with distance metrics, and an old personal favorite - topic models.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/bhargavvader/personal/tree/master/notebooks/text_analysis_tutorial\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
