description: "Benjamin Misell | Sunday 11:30 | Room D\n\nAny of you from the 80's will remember the BBC Micro. Well, I got one about half a year ago and have been fascinated by it ever since. The 8-bit 2MHz limitations are part of the joy of it.\n\nEver since I learnt it had an assembler I've been learning assembly and one day I just thought \"Let's write a C compiler for this\" (bad idea), but I went with it and that's what this talk is about my journey and findings along the way of writing a C compiler in python.\n\nLink to slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CI44dKoqvSAUBKAZb5q4GGtxvAhuYdGf48znMQUDThA/edit#slide=id.g253db81ee6_0_140"
