title: 'Resilient Architecture by Matt Stine'
language: English
recordingDate: 1501629233
description: 'In the past we tried to create robust systems via mistake prevention. Modern approaches take a different approach called resiliency. Resilient architectures enhance observability, leverage well-known resiliency patterns (like Circuit Breakers), and embrace chaos. This presentation will show you how to create resilient systems using technologies like Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Retry, Netflix Hystrix, and Chaos Engineering.'
