description: "NMRC Panel - Free Your Mind: The NMRC Info/Warez\nFree Your Mind: The NMRC Info/Warez\n\nNew years bring new threats. Laws such as the DMCA, PATRIOT and DSEA are threatening hackers to the core. But instead of lecturing on what the underground could be doing to counter, NMRC will lead by example and present what they have been working on for the past year. New tools, new techniques, new information, and a new operating system! All open source, all full disclosure, all with security and privacy in mind.\n\nNMRC is an international hacker collective with an active membership of fourteen men and women. Members have worked on projects ranging from operating systems and tools development to penetration testing and forensics. By day, most members live respectable lives working or consulting within the Fortune 500 in unsuspecting IT departments. By night, they hack under cloak of anonymity in the underground community."
