description: "I love Ruby! But as in any relationship, to love means that you have to accept the \"dark side\" too! Ruby is human and has a lot of gotchas, tricks, wierdness and sometimes scary features that I plan to highlight. This talk aims to provide the \"Ah-ha!\" moments when working in Ruby.\n\nThis talk is for beginners and experts alike - in fact, I tag slides to mark their level and beginners can choose to tune out of the heavy stuff! My talk shall cover the dark side of the following features of Ruby (in no particular order)\n\nBase Conversions\nInfinity\nKeywords\nmethod missing\nModule inheritance (it exists!)\nCurried Procs\nCherry picking module methods\nOniguruma games\nprocs, blocks and my friend stubby.\nObject ids\n==, ===, eql? and equal?\nand more...\nAs with most of my talks, humor play an important role and I shall aim to get everyone high on Ruby with a deep dive!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4U/"
