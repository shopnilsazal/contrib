description: "Connecting Things Together is Really Difficult but it Could and Should be Rather Easy\nhttp://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2014/joe-armstrong\n\nThis talk is about how we connect programs together.\n\nI'll talk about composing complex systems from simple parts. Simple things are easy to make, but complex things made by composing simple things are very difficult to build. It talk about why this is so, and what we can do about it.\nIn this talk, I'll visit monads, pipes, protocols and contracts.\nFinally I'll suggest some ways to glue things together that provide stronger guarantees of consistency than many of the methods we use today."
