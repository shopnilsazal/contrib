description: "The Middler 2.0: It's Not Just for Web Apps Anymore\nJay Beale Co-Founder, InGuardians, Inc.\nJustin Searle Sr. Security Analyst, InGuardians\n\nThe Middler is a next-generation man-in-the-middle tool that takes the focus beyond the raw mechanics of the protocol on to the application itself. New for Def Con, it now can man in the middle Voice over IP (VoIP), producing the opportunity to interactively redirect calls, join them, or take them over. All of these effects join The Middler's goal of putting the victim into a kind of matrix by implementing man in the middle attacks specific to each web application. We've also added a graphical interface, allowing for interactive target selection based on information that The Middler gathers about potential victims. We've added more applications and enhanced the set of non-application specific capabilities, including easy session cloning, IFRAME injection and a Java script exploit library that can force the user into the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) or a Metasploit exploit. This demo-filled talk will enhance your man in the middle powers just in time for one of the most hostile networks ever seen.\n\nJay Beale has created a number of security tools, including Bastille UNIX and the CIS Unix Scoring Tool, both of which are widely used throughout industry and government. He has served as an invited speaker at many industry and government conferences, a columnist for Information Security Magazine, SecurityPortal and SecurityFocus, and a contributor to nine books, including those in his Open Source Security Series and the \"Stealing the Network\" series. Jay works as a security analyst at InGuardians.\n\nJustin Searle a Senior Security Analyst with InGuardians, specializes in security architecture and penetration testing. Previously, Justin served as the IT Security Architect for JetBlue Airways and has provided top-tier support for some of the largest supercomputers in the world. Justin has taught courses in hacking techniques, intrusion detection, forensics, and networking and has presented at a number of security conferences including DEFCON, ToorCon, Shmoocon, and SANS. In his spare time, he helps lead and develop several open source projects such as The Middler, SamuraiWTF, Yokoso! and Laudanum. Justin has an MBA in International Technology and holds several industry certifications.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
