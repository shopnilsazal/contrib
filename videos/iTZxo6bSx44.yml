description: "BY: STEFAN PENNER\n\nOne overarching theme in the Ember.js philosophy is to put developers on a path to success, primarily this is done by making that path have the lowest resistance.\n\nOn several fronts this pattern has been quite successful, but on one important front we fall short, performance. This is the result of framework and run-time misalignment. This talk describes how we as a community can solve this problem in our apps and the framework.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GO1J/"
