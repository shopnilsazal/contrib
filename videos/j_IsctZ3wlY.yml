description: "Hacking, Biohacking, and the Future of Humanity\nRichard Thieme ThiemeWorks\n\nI was asked in 2006 at AusCert in Australia, my second of three years of keynoting, where did I see hacking headed in the future? I described biohacking and noted that genetic engineering, neuroscience (both black and white R&D) and the availability of everything one needs for a few thousand bucks to hack the genome in a garage, all made hacking human attributes and identity the next level of the transformation of human possibility.\n\nThis talk illuminates how current and future developments in information systems, robotics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and the colonization of the solar system through telerobotic and human exploration, all suggest ways human identity will be hacked and enhanced. The evolution of post-human identity is in our hands. This talk sounds like science fiction but isn't. It delivers profound insights into the next chapter of human civilization.\n\nRichard Thieme (www.thiemeworks.com) is an author and professional speaker focused on the deeper implications of technology, religion, and science for twenty-first century life.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
