description: "Description\nThe talk is an introduction to programming in Julia and it constructed around hands-on example of its usage. The material is selected in order to help the participants learn when Julia can be a language of choice for solving practical problems. No previous knowledge of Julia is required. Similarities and differences to Python and R will be discussed.\n\nAbstract\nJulia programming language tries to solve problem of delivering a flexible dynamic language, appropriate for scientific and numerical computing, with performance comparable to traditional statically-typed languages.\n\nThe talk will discuss in particular: 1. How Julia was designed to allow C-level execution speed? 2. What are benefits and costs of such design? 3. Performance of Julia vs R and Python; in particular comparison to Numba .\n\nIn order to keep the talk practical all concepts will be discussed using a typical numerical computing task from quantitative finance - pricing of Asian options.\n\nThe presentation will be concluded by discussion of current state of Julia language ecosystem and its readiness for deployment in production solutions.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
