description: "Copy of the slides for this talk are here: https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Minozhenko/DEFCON-20-Minozhenko-Hack-VMware-60-Seconds.pdf\nHow to Hack VMware vCenter Server in 60 Seconds\nAlexander Minozhenko Senior Penetration Tester, ERPScan\n\nThis talk will discuss some ways to gain control over the virtual infrastructure through vCenter's services. I will describe a few non-dangerous bugs (they were 0-days when we found them), but if we can use all of them together, we will get administrative access to vCenter which means to the whole virtual network.\n\nAlexander Minozhenko works in the leading IT security company ERPScan as penetration tester. Alexander graduated in 2012 from St. Petersburg National Research University ITMO, faculty of computer science. Also he likes to participate in CTF competition.\nTwitter: @al3xmin"
