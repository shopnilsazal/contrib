title: 'Serverless? Not so FaaS!The JVM and Docker, a good idea? by Matt Stine'
language: English
recordingDate: 1501572010
description: 'There are multiple incarnations of what we’re calling serverless, including the category of services formerly known as “(mobile) backend as a service” or MBaaS, as well as the more recent “functions as a service” or FaaS. While these two categories are quite distinct, they both revolve around the next evolutionary step from microservices, abstracting away nearly all of the mortar necessary to compose your bricks into solutions. First movers in these spaces include providers such as Auth0 and Amazon Lambda. Nearly all of these solutions are immature, but also show great promise. The learner should leave this session with a solid understanding of the serverless landscape and be able to confront the hype in an effective manner.'
