description: "Hackers gonna hack – But do they know why? Previous academic studies have investigated the psychological aspects of information security, but the focus has been on social engineering or attempts to define hacker characteristics/motivations. This neglects the wider social psychological processes that influence everyone who takes part in online communities. These processes are important; they determine how we understand, perceive and interact with the members of our own group and the groups around us. What is especially notable from social psychological research are the many mistakes people make in trying to interpret those around us, mistakes which can lead to underestimating risk or creating unnecessary tensions.\n\nThis talk will explore how social psychological research should be used to improve understanding of all the groups who may be involved in an information security incident. Regardless of how much of an anarchist or rebel we might be, it will be discussed how individuals are strongly influenced by the norms and identity of their group – and whether this is a good thing or not."
