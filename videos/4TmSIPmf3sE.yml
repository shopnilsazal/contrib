description: "As you grow in your career, chances are that one day you will end up as the Technical Lead of 1 or more projects. Often not by choice. The role of Technical Lead is quite different from the role of (senior) Software Developer and this talk will bring you answers on questions like:\n\nHow do I do technical interviews?\nHow do I lead a team? How do I lead multiple teams?\nHow do I cope with my new responsibilities?\nHow do I cope with success / failure?\nHow do I prevent losing focus on the technical challenges?\nâ€¦\n\nIn summary, everything you want(ed) to know on your first day as a Technical Lead and that you can use every day from that point onwards."
