description: "Talk given by Michael K. Daly, Director of Enterprise Security Services for Raytheon Company, at the 23rd Large Installation System Administration Conference (LISA '09).\n\nCritical infrastructures and the governments, corporations, and individuals supporting them are under attack by increasingly sophisticated cyber threats from hostile entities. Their goal is to gain access to intellectual property, personally identifiable information, financial data, and targeted strategic information. This is not simple fraud or hacking. It is intellectual property theft and infrastructure corruption on a grand scale. This talk will discuss the ways operators of national critical infrastructure are working to combat these threats and the collaborative partnerships that have been formed to strengthen our collective defenses."
