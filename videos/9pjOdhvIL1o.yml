description: "Biotech companies have historically been started by professors from prestigious institutions with millions of dollars of investment funding. Today, with the lowering cost of research and increasing amount of resources driven by Moore's law, robotics, software and efficiencies in bioproduction, anyone with an insight can start a biotech company for a fraction of the cost, be they PhD or biohacker.\n\nAt IndieBio, the world's largest biotech accelerator started just under 3 years ago, we've funded and help founders build 70 companies that redefine speed and innovation for biology. We have trained graduate students and first-time founders into entrepreneurs and have expanded biotechnology beyond therapeutics and medical devices. We see biology as the next big technology platform with applications in food, regenerative medicine, consumer products, neurotech, and bio-IT interfacing. Come hear about the big problems our companies are solving with biology as technology!"
