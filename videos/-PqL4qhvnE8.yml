description: "There's a lot of competition to define the next big unicorn performance metric, but does this unicorn actually exist? In the past, we relied on metrics like page load time, start render, and time to first paint to measure user experience, but we now know that these metrics don't tell the full story.\n\nThe key to a good user experience is quickly delivering the content your visitors care about the most. This is easy to say, but tricky to do. Every site has unique content and unique user engagement goals, which is why measuring how quickly critical content renders is a hugely challenging task.\n\nTammy will walk through a brief history of UX and web performance research, highlighting landmark studies that helped connect the dots between performance and user experience. She'll also demystify the current state of performance metrics and help you understand what you need to focus on for your site and your users."
