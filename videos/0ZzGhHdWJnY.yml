title: 'MountainWest RubyConf 2013 Extending CRuby with native Graph data type by Andy Pliszka'
recordingDate: 1367259387
description: "Reading of the CRuby source code can provide unparalleled insight into the Ruby language. During this talk we will add new native Graph data type to CRuby. The new Graph data structure will be simple but on par with other native types such as Array or Hash. This talk will demonstrate that it is easy to experiment with CRuby and extend it. We will also demonstrate the speed advantage of using C to boost Ruby performance. We will implement a few of the greatest hits of graph algorithms: Breath First Search, Dijkstra, and Minimum Spanning Tree.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGbR/"
