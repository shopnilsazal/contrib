What stops you from being a one-hit wonder? Is there an age limit to productive hackery? What are the key ingredients needed and how can you up your chances of doing great work? In a talk unabashedly stolen from far greater minds we hope to answer these questions and discuss their repercussions.\n\nABOUT HAROON MEER\n\nHaroon Meer is the founder of Thinkst, an applied research company with a deep focus on Information Security. Haroon has contributed to several books on Penetration Testing and Security and is a regular speaker at both academic and industry conferences around the world."
