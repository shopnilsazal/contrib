description: 'High productivity, extreme attention to detail, logical/calculated, passionate, and hyper-focused. These are all characteristics considered valuable in the information security industry. However, a certain group of people who exceed expectations in these skill sets are constantly overlooked for job positions. That group of people is the High Functioning Autistic (HFA) community. Individuals in the high functioning autistic community are often overlooked for job positions due to their social disabilities which makes them perform poorly in an interview and in their interactions with other people. However, if you look past their awkward behavior and social struggles, you will find these individuals are perfectly suited for roles in the information security industry. This talk aims to show the listeners that, as many tech companies have found, the HFA community is ripe with individuals who could be the best of the best in the security industry if given the chance. The audience will realize that a small investment in time, understanding, and acceptance can result in the addition of an invaluable member to a Security Operations team.'
