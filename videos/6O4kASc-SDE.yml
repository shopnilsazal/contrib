description: "Filmed at PyData London 2017\n\nDescription\nThis talk will be an exposition of machine learning with random forests for Python programmers. The talk will cover the internals of how random forests are implemented, applications that are well suited to the use of random forests, and Python code samples to demonstrate their use.\n\nAbstract\nOutline\nIntro (5 minutes)\nWhat are random forests, how are they used, and what Python software is available for using them?\nWhat strengths do they have relative to other models (scalability and applicability to a broad range of problems)?\nForest Internals (15 minutes)\nDecision Trees (5 minutes)\nPresentation of the decision tree model, the building block of random forests.\nEntropy Minimization (5 minutes)\nExplanation of how decision trees are tuned using entropy minimization.\nBuilding Forests from Decision Trees (5 minutes)\nExplanation of how decision trees are aggregated to form random forests.\nIllustrative Examples (10 minutes)\nRegression on non-linear functions (5 minutes)\nClassification with unscaled features (5 minutes)\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
