recordingDate: 1453482723
description: "Huge, open world games like Skyrim and Fallout 3 demand a great deal of development talent, and can be daunting to plan and create - especially when subject to the constant and often unpredictable flux of a game in development. This level design oriented talk, given at GDC 2014's Level Design In A Day bootcamp by Joel Burgess, will share insights into the iterative approach used at Bethesda Game Studios to help their level design team plan, implement, test and polish massive amounts of content.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
