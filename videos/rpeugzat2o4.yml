title: 'Cascadia Ruby 2013 We All Make Mistakes: Learning from Gaffes in the Ruby Community by Nick Cox'
recordingDate: 1385597725
description: "Whether we knew it beforehand or not, we've deployed bad code. Sometimes it fails in a small, containable way. Sometimes it fails catastrophically in a great conflagration of NoMethodErrors, lost revenue, and anxiety. As software developers, we've all made mistakes.\n\nBut due to the heightening sense of impostor syndrome in the Ruby community, it can be difficult to talk about our programming missteps; we often fear that we'll be thought of as incompetent.\n\nThis talk will uncover the psychological underpinnings of hiding failure. Additionally, it will discuss practical techniques for authentic and honest public postmortems, so that we can learn from our own mistakes and teach others, ultimately benefitting and enriching the entire Ruby community.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG5l/"
