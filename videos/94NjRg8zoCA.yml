description: 'Computers are pretty good at reading text. They’ve not always been that great at understanding what all the text means; especially if the mountains of text are buried in arcane business and financial documents – many of which have been scanned in. Clojure offers an elegant way for machines to finally understand documents.   Leveraging some core language features + 3rd party Clojure libraries has allowed our business to transform our lending criteria and processes.'
