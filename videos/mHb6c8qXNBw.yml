Not with the Open Build Service, the Free Software buildand distribution system which powers openSUSE, ownCloud and Tizen! Usually alot of manual work is necessary to create your custom Linux appliance, but theOpen Build Service abstracts all the complicated technologies and makes thistask as easy as pie. In this talk, we will show you how we plug several opensource technologies together to create Linux appliances in a fully automated,continuous integration cycle.\n\nGetting a new Linux appliance with every commit you push sounds awesome butimpossible, right?

In this talk, we will show you how we plug several opensource technologies together to create Linux appliances in a fully automated,continuous integration cycle.\n\nStarting with a commit to your favorite version control system, the OBS willbuild a ready-to-use image of an operating system for you automatically, usingthe power of KIWI. And to finish the continuous integration cycle, openQA willrun automated tests to make sure your appliance still works as expected.\n\nIf you still manually build and test your Linux appliances, this talk is foryou!\n\n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 12:30:00"
