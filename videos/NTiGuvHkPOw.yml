description: "Rubyik's Cube by Stafford Brunk\n\nThe Rubik's Cube is one of the world's most recognizable puzzles. Knowing how to solve a scrambled cube can almost be called a badge of honor. While there are a multitude of books, articles, and apps on how to solve a cube as a human, what does it take to have a computer solve the problem? This talk will dive into exactly that question. We'll start with an overview of Rubik's Cube algorithms, move onto the logistics of implementing these algorithms, and finish up with some real examples of using Ruby to solve a Rubik's Cube!"
