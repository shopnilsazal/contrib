description: "Radomir Dopieralski - Making robots walk with Python\n[EuroPython 2016]\n[19 July 2016]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/making-robots-walk-with-python)\n\nYou will see several different walking robots controlled with Python\nin different ways, and learn how they were built and programmed.\n\n-----\n\nMaking a robot walk is not easy, especially when all it has for brains\nis a small microcontroller which you have to program in C. During this\ntalk you will see different ways in which such a robot can be\ncontrolled in Python, either by using remote control, with the Python\nprogram running on a stationary computer, by putting a small computer,\nsuch as a Raspberry Pi on it, or by programming it with Micropython, a\nversion of the Python language designed for microcontrollers. I will\nalso explain the basic problems with walking robots and how Python can\nbe used to overcome them. Finally, I will show some of the robots I\nhave built."
