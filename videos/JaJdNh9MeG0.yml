title: 'UXDD (User Experience Driven Development): Build for your users, not your tests'
recordingDate: 1347747847
description: "All too often programmers get into a productive rhythm where they receive their requirements, write tests aligned to those requirements, and then look for the green and red. While this process is proven to be highly effective, it can lead to developers missing the mark, as they aim for functional completeness and not the polish that an end user requires.\n\nWe should start proposing breakpoints for developers to step away from their automated tests, and play with the features they are working on. It's too easy for developers to get caught up in their process and forget about the end user experience. In this presentation you will learn several techniques for developing for the user experience, even when you're buried in code.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGg5/"
