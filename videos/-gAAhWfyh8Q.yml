description: "Lightning Talk: Refactoring of Self by Vaidehi Joshi\n\nAs new programmers, we don't always write beautiful code. In fact, most of our early code is quite bad. So we try to refactor it. \n\nBut refactoring also plays a significant role in our personal lives. As programmers, we 'refactor' ourselves on a daily basis. We implement different technologies, learn new skills, and confront our own mistakes every day -- all in an effort to become better at what we do. And in the process, we become better iterations of ourselves. \n\nThis talk will explore how programming challenges us to not only refactor our own code, but also our very own sense of self."
