title: 'LoneStarRuby Conf 2010 - Deciphering Yehuda by: Gregg Pollack'
recordingDate: 1428424624
description: 'Yehuda Katz has done some great Ruby refactoring for Rails 3 over the past year, but do you really understand what he''s done? In this talk, Gregg Pollack will attempt to examine Yehuda''s work, identify and deconstruct each programming technique that he''s applied, and then teach them in a way that everyone can understand.Some of the techniques to be discussed will include: Method Compilation vs Method Missing, Microkernel Architecture, alias_method_chain vs super, ActiveSupport Concern, Catch/Throw in Bundler, and increased Rack compatibility.Attendees should walk away with a greater understanding of some advanced Ruby design patterns and a better insight into the internals of Rails 3.'
