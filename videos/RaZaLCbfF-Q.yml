description: "Spacecraft Operators require extremely reliable, accurate, and real time software to optimize the efficiency of spacecraft operations and to ensure proper commands are issued to take pictures of the Earth. Any loss of contact or data misreading due to software error can be mission ending.\n\nCome learn how our team developed a lightweight JavaScript real-time event-driven platform utilizing WebSockets and proven open source technology such as jQuery to enable a cross platform mission operations center. Prototypes and testing tools were created to verify the data stability and limits of several different real time technologies, from Comet to WebSockets, while constant performance testing was done to keep the memory footprint low in the browser while maintaining high data volume. This platform has supported day in the life testing of SkySat-1, our first imaging satellite."
