title: 'DEF CON 16 - Ryan Trost: Evade IDS/IPS Systems using Geospatial Threat Detection'
recordingDate: 1385420786
description: "IDS/IPS systems are becoming more and more advanced and geocoding is adding another layer of intelligence to try and defend against a company's vulnerabilities. Learn how to evade complex geospatial threat detection countermeasures. Most crackers use zombie machines to launch professional attacks...but zombies even leave geographic fingerprints that are easily picked up by pattern recognition algorithms. Learn how to take professional attacks to the next level.\n\nRyan Trost is the Director of Security and the Data Privacy Officer at Comprehensive Health Services where he oversees all the organization's security and privacy decisions. He teaches several Information Technology courses including Ethical Hacking, Intrusion Detection and Data Visualization at Northern Virginia Community College which allows him to continue his technical interests. In his spare time he is working to cross-pollinate Network Security, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Data Visualization and is considered a leading expert in geospatial intrusion detection techniques. Ryan participated as a RedTeamer in the first annual Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) and fielded a team of students this past year. Ryan has been a Senior Security Consultant for several government agencies before transitioning over to the private sector. In 2005, Ryan received his MS degree in Computer Science from George Washington University where he developed his first geospatial intrusion detection tool.\n\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
