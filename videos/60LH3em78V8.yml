recordingDate: 1431538186
description: "By, Andy Croll\nRunning tasks outside the request-response loop is a must in modern web apps.\n\nActiveJob is a great addition to Rails (in 4.2) providing a standard interface to various asynchronous gems (Delayed_Job/Sidekiq etc). Has it also ushered in something else? A way to do 'Service Objects' the 'Rails Way'?"
