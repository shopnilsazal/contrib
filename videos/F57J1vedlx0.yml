description: 'As Ruby programmers our server side programs throw us in all kind of troubles. Hung processes, memory leaks, process spending too much time in GC, profiling etceteras. As mostly live coding and hands on session, I intend to show - how to use modern tools to find and fix these problems. I will be demonstrating, how to use GDB with live process, using rbtrace, perftools and various ways to detect memory leaks & performance bottle necks in your process.'
