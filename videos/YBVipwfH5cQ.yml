description: "Unified Monitoring of Containers and Microservices [I] - Nishant Sahay, Wipro Limited\n\nMicroservices are become critical for enterprise strategy towards simplifying their IT landscape. For a successful journey of microservice adoption, Container management, DevOps and Monitoring play an important role. Managing microservices in large-scale deployments are fraught with many unique challenges for enterprise IT.\n\nFollowing are some of the key metrics of microservice monitoring which will enable the enterprises to manage their container platforms better:\n\n1. Collecting logs, metrics from containers\n2. Monitoring application running inside the container\n3. Distributed tracing and the time taken by each service call.\n4. Storage, analysis of collected metrics, logs\n5. Performing RCA and anomaly detection on the collected logs and metrics \n\nThis session would explain how to harness the power of Zipkin with the intelligence of Spark ecosystem and the flexibility of ELK+ Beats to create a unified monitoring solution. Key features of this solution are â€“ utilization of distributed tracing, infrastructure metrics to manage containers. All this is done through visualization, correlation and predictive monitoring\n\nAbout Nishant Sahay\nNishant is a senior architect at Wipro Technologies with extensive experience in data architecture, design and visualization.
