description: "About a year ago, we started a journey to see if kids can code. Guess what?\n\nThey can!!\n\nThis talk will be a review of the journey itself and a discussion between parent and child on what happened, what's next, and what you should be doing to encourage the next generation of developers.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG53/"
