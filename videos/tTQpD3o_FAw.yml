description: "RubyConf 2016 - Better Code Through Boring(er) Tests by Betsy Haibel\n\nYour tests are annoying. Whenever you update your application code, you need to change a lot of them. You've built yourself some test macros, and some nice FactoryGirl factories, and installed this really cool matcher gem... and your tests are still annoying. What if you changed your application code instead? In this talk, you'll learn what \"listening to your tests\" means in the real world: no mysticism, no arrogant TDD purism, just a few practical refactorings you can use tomorrow at work."
