recordingDate: 1392880515
description: "Thomas J. Munn & tgr2mfx - Using Filesystem Crypto and Other Approaches to Protect Your Data/Privacy on BSD and LINUX\nThis talk will cover using the LOOP-AES package to encyrpt data on a removable, USB hard disk in linux.\n\nThe presentation will focus on using encryption to protect your data, via using GNUPG, removable keychain, and a removable hard disk, to encrypt your home directory. It will focus on how to install the USB device, include a script for getting things going \"automagically\", and installing the LOOP-AES patch to both a stock and a custom kernel. The bsd portion of the talk will cover the use of tightvnc, ssh tunnels, 802.11 and vnconfig to keep personal data personal in a business environment.\n\nThomas Munn-- Thomas Munn started security in 1997, working for Kellogg's on a now defunct firewall. He has worked in the financial, health, and cereal industries. He has spoken at the last 3 defcons, on topics ranging from personal firewalls to automated intrusion detection ideas. His outstanding accomplishments are: setting up a SNORT IDS box, integrating windows and NT via ssh, and getting a loopback device to encrypt his homedirectory. His first computer was an Atari 800. He enjoys meeting hacker types and learning from them. He knows a little perl, and is a LINUX guru, with a smattering of OPENBSD. He despises Microsoft Windows.\n\ntgr2mfx-- tgr2mfx has been #!'ing in an Installshield world since the days of BSD/386. He hails originally from Plessis, NY but streetraces in Denver now. Wills current projects are writing fibonacci sequencers in bourne shell, fidgiting with a bourne shell SQL equivalent for /etc, a p2p file sharing system (using multicast-ip6, ssh and nfs) and an automagic src and ports installer for OpenBSD."
