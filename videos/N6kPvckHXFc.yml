description: 'One of the central themes of DevOps is applying software engineering techniques to operations work so that operations people could have better things: CI/CI/infra as code/repeatable builds/code reviews/etc. And while DevOps, in general, is much larger in concept than that one initiative and set of goals, people are are still stuck on that. We consistently see software delivered that isn''t operable. DevOps must be reanimated with the mission of applying operations engineering techniques to software engineering work, so that DevOps can live on.'
