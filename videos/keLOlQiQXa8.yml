description: "PyCon Canada 2015: https://2015.pycon.ca/en/schedule/14/\n\nTalk Description:\nIn this talk we'll present the inconveniences of working directly with objects returned by an ORM. We'll discuss:\n\n- the issues of having database sessions attached to objects;\n- the ability to maintain independence and flexibility around different storage solutions;\n- and we will also talk about the general question of how to decide which object layer you should base your application logic on.\n\nThis talk is inspired by a real-world use case, and we'll present the before and after states of implementing our current (production) solution: a database-agnostic data service API that promotes immutable objects for any module to consume."
