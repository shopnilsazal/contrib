description: "Gunpoint was Tom Francis' first game, he made it in his spare time, he didn't go mad, he finished it, and it went down really well both critically and commercially. In this 2015 talk, Francis covers how to judge whether an idea is good or just ambitious, how to manage being unsure of whether an idea will work, how to make a better game by doing nothing, how to break out of perfectionism and get something finished, how to feel OK about yourself on days where you get very little done, and why good game concepts aren't good enough.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
