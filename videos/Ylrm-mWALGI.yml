title: 'RailsConf 2014 - The "Rails of JavaScript" Won''t be a Framework by Justin Searls'
language: English
recordingDate: 1400265423
description: "Last year, DHH said \"good frameworks are extractions, not inventions.\" The success of Rails lets us forget its roots as an extraction from an HTML-based UI. The failure of Rails has been its perception as \"best web framework ever\" instead of \"best web framework for apps like Basecamp\". Given that, it's clear why Rails makes writing a UI in HTML a joy but does few favors for JavaScript-heavy apps. Joy can be had in JavaScript, and we'll show how with Lineman.js & tools extracted to help find it!\n\nJustin Searls has two professional passions: writing great software and sharing what he's learned in order to help others write even greater software. He and his team at Test Double have the pleasure of living out both passions every day, working closely with clients to find simple solutions to complex problems.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG05/"
