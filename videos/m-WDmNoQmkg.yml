description: "RailsConf 2017: Leading When You're Not in Charge by Scott Lesser\n\nJust because you don't have lead / senior / manager / owner in your title, doesn't mean there isn't plenty of opportunity to lead. No matter where you are in your career, come discover how to communicate more effectively, embrace self-awareness, and influence those leading you. Don't wait for a title to tell you to lead. Take responsibility where you are, and let the titles come to you."
