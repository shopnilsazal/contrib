description: "It's your first day at Hogwarts.com, and everything is wonderful and thrilling. You dig in to classes, and soon find a dusty book with a cryptic warning: \n\n\"Do NOT on any circumstances make ANY change to this magic incantation without talking to Doug first!!!\" \n\nSound familiar? Approaching a legacy code base can feel like unraveling a mystery, not just about the code, but about the personalities who wrote it. What tools and techniques can help you solve the maze of twisty code? Let's explore how to get a handle on legacy code, how to negotiate joining an existing team of developers, and how we can get a summa cum laude at graduation.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG3x/"
