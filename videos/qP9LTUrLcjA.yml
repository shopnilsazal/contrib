description: "by Jamis Buck\nA live coding session. Real maze algorithms. 3D surfaces. Animations, first-person fly-throughs of spherical and toroidal mazes. Hexagons, octagons, and regular tilings. Mazes in shapes you never even dreamed of.\nColoring techniques. Rendering techniques. Visualization. HOLY MOTHER OF THESEUS! This is going to be so hot.\nBut bring a seat belt, because it’s going to move really, really fast. Don’t blink or you’ll miss something awesome. Maybe bring some eye drops, too, because your eyes will get really dry from all that NOT BLINKING.\nThink I’m joking? Show up and call my bluff.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GWI4/"
