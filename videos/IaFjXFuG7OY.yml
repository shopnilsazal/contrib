description: "Compose All the Things by Mike North\n\nAs ember is being used for the foundation of even more ambitious web applications, the appeal of leveraging less code to do more has grown. Keeping composability in mind will allow teams to effectively build their own layers of “boilerplate” on top of the framework, and build apps high quality and velocity.\nIn this talk, we’ll dive into composable components, computed property macros and tests to explore how investment in generic code can pay off in terms of high degrees of maintainability, testability and extensibility."
