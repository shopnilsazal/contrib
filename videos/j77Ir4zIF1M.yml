description: "PyData Dallas 2015\nWe have been seeing increasing use of hashtags in social media. How can businesses leverage the power of hashtags? By opting to use specific hashtags, customers may be expressing alignments with concepts and what does knowing more about such alignment would do to businesses? In this discussion I will walk through the use of topic modeling based on clusters of conversations (primarily tweets) and identify associations between users. I will then show how such association can be augmented with additional Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities towards solving the primary business goal of how to find a set of potential lookalikes of premium customers for a given business. This presentation will use a combination of Python and Java components on Hadoop platform."
