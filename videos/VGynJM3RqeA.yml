title: 'Rocky Mountain Ruby 2015 - Carriers, Services and views on a diet by Vipul A M'
recordingDate: 1444062316
description: "Anyone who has done any Rails development knows that views gets complicated very fast. Conditional styling, violating laws of delimiter by double dots, complex business logic deciding view context, skewing and much more plague typical rails views.\n\nIn this talk we'll explore use of simple ruby classes to clean up views, models, controllers, by use of services. We'll delve deeper into 'View Carriers', extracting away complexity out of views, take a look at when rails view helpers fail us, testing strategies, and comparing existing approaches like Trailblazer.\n\nBecause views need to be beautiful too!"
