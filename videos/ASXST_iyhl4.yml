description: "VR with tracked controllers makes us re-think how players interact with our games and that should include challenging the very idea of menus. This 2016 talk from Northway Games' Colin Northway will include a survey of how current games are replacing what would traditionaly be a menu with interactible 3D objects and how interface design in VR is getting closer to industrial design and how that's going to make games more intuitive and more fun.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
