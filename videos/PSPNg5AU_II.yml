description: "Bringing 1976 into 2016: Ticketmaster’s Public Cloud and Kubernetes Strategy - Justin Dean, Ticketmaster.com\n\n\"Ticketmaster redefined an entire market by being the first to put computers in box offices. We now have four decades worth of products and tools that connect fans with the live events they love. When you are the big fish in the pond you have to reinvent yourself; even if it might be painful at times.  Containers and enabling technologies like Kubernetes allow us to keep pace like never before.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss the challenges that we’ve faced with having tens of thousands of servers and decades of technology that power the world’s largest ticketing engines.  Imagine the need to build out your infrastructure to support demand spikes that go from idle to 100% capacity in only a few seconds.   Now retrofit all that infrastructure and the applications to be cloud native before a hard deadline of data center lease renewals.   What technologies would you use to make that possible?\"\n\nAbout Justin Dean\nSVP, Platform and Technical Operations, Ticketmaster\nJustin is the SVP of TechOps for Ticketmaster.com"
