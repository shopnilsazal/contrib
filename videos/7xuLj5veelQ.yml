description: "OWASP Enterprise Security API by Kevin Wall\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API\n\nLive at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects_Summit_2013\n\nESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web application security control library that makes it easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI libraries are designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications. The ESAPI libraries also serve as a solid foundation for new development."
