title: 'RailsConf 2014 - Where did the OO go? Views Should be Objects Too!'
language: English

description: "By Andrew Warner\n\nIs app/views the worst part of your codebase? Have you ever told someone on your team \"remember to update the client-side views too\"? Too long has the node.js community touted their advantage of using the same code on the client and the server. It's time that Rails got a few punches in.\n\nWe should think of views as objects, not template files. In this talk I show how that lets us tease apart presentation from data, and build logic-less templates that are shared between client and server.\n\nAndrew Warner studied CS and Psychology at Wesleyan. He has worked at companies large and small and with tech stacks ranging from Java/Spring to Ruby on Rails. He is currently a developer at Rap Genius, where he helps build and scale a Rails backend so that all of text can be annotated.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1h/"
