description: "\"This is kind of new to me, Iâ€™ve dealt with a lack of motivation before, but never anything like this.\" \nHow do you balance salary vs motivation? What are your options?\n\nNon-accredited no-credentials dev and design therapists MPJ and David, and the participants of the Fun Fun Forum help a fellow colleague out. \n\nThis is an experiment with a podcast-style format where we lift the non-tech, non-design aspects of life at work. These other \"things\" and conflicts can often severely limit your performance and enjoyment of your profession.\n\nLet us know what you think of this format and the discussion in the comments. \n\nSubscribe if you want more of this!\n\nThe topic discussed is taken from the Fun Fun Forum https://www.funfunforum.com/t/anti-motivated/4952 (paywall). You don't need to have access to enjoy this video.\n\nThere's a companion discussion on how to deal with authority for authority's sake on Fun Fun Function: https://youtu.be/saRjCC_fgXk"
