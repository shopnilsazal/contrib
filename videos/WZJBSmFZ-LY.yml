description: "Moving the Web into the Physical World with Beacons by Meike Wiemann\n\nHave you ever wondered what those beacons are? Beacons come in a lot of forms. I lately got my hands on some of the so-called physical web beacons. Physical web beacons are little devices that broadcast a URL via Bluetooth within a certain radius. You might wonder, so what? Well, the power of these beacons is that people, places and objects can become part of the Web and we can start designing for context-sensitive experiences. To give you an idea about the range of possibilities that become available I want to show some of my very simple prototypes that I built with Ruby, Rails and JavaScript. However, just being able to build cool stuff does not necessarily mean that it will be useful for someone. So, I evaluated how users experience this technology and I want to present the results to you as well.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GxRo/"
