description: "\"Writing Awesome PyPI packages in Python\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - PyCharm Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nOne of the strengths of the Python programming language is the huge base of Open Source libraries. The PyPI (Python Package Index) repository provides currently 105,917 packages, many of them developed actively by contributors. \n\nThis talk is a tour through various tools and practices, which help to keep your package in a good state for your users and make it easier for other developers to contribute. One can find these practices in projects of different size, such as Django (24,244  commits, 1,397 contributors) Pandas (15,005 commits, 754 contributors) and Faker (20 commits, 3 contributors).\n\nSome things to consider when creating your own package:\n\nusing a Makefile for automatic testing, coverage analysis and environment setup.\nstructuring your .gitignore file.\nusing pyenv and .python-version for Python version management.\nusing tox to ascertain that code is working in different environments.\nsquashing different configuration files to a single setup.cfg file.\nusing EditorConfig and .editorconfig to automatically set project coding standards in the editor.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
