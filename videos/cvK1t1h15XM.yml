description: "Local Ephemeral Storage Resource Management - Jing Xu, Google\n\nCurrently Kubernetes does not support storage resource usage guarantee and isolation like compute resources such as CPU and memory. This talk will present out effort for improving Storage Resource Management in Kubernetes with focus on capacity isolation in ephemeral storage. It will explain how we support resource guarantee and isolation at node, pod, and container levels.\n\nAbout Jing Xu\nJing Xu obtained her Ph.D. from Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Florida in May 2011. After graduation, she had been a lecture in School of Computer Science in Florida International University for about 4 years. She moved to Bay area in late 2014 and joined VMware, working on Storage Policy Based Management project. Later in 2016, she joined Kubernetes team in Google and now is working on storage management."
