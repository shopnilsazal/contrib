description: 'DEF CON has changed for the better since the days at the Alexis Park. It has evolved from a few speaking tracks to an event that still offers the speakers, but also Villages, where you can get hands-on experience and Demo Labs where you can see tools in action. Of course, there is still the Entertainment and Contest Area, as well as Capture The Flag. There is so much more to DEF CON than there was in the past and it is our goal to help you get the best experience possible. In addition to introducing each of the different aspects and areas of DEF CON, we have a panel of speakers that will talk about how they came to be part of DEF CON and their personal experiences over the years. Oh yeah, there is the time honored "Name the Noob", lots of laughs and maybe even some prizes. Plus, stay for the after party. Seriously, there is an after party. How awesome is that?'
