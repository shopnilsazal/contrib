The Azure team has been working hard to improve the ease of container-native app development, using 100% open source technology. Come see how much has changed building applications for Kubernetes; things you can use anywhere Kubernetes is; anywhere you are.\n\nAbout Ralph\nRalph Squillace is a Principal Program Manager for the open-source, container-native dev and ops Kubernetes tooling built by Azure. He oversees contributions to Helm, Draft, Brigade, VS Code Kubernetes extensions, and any random thing that makes building apps in containers easier, faster, and more secure."
