title: 'Ctries in Clojure; or, Concurrent Transients - Micha≈Ç Marczyk'
recordingDate: 1436261981
description: "The ability of persistent data structures to participate in complex version graphs where many independent instances of a data structure are derived from a single original through the application of various update-like operations is crucial to many of the benefits that they bring to our day-to-day programming in Clojure.\n\nCtries, presented by Prokopec, Bronson, Bagwell and Odersky, bring this ability to the world of concurrently modifiable data structures. In addition, they are lock-free (\"global progress guaranteed\") and admit constant-time snapshots; and under the hood, they bear a striking resemblance to Clojure's transients.\n\nThis talk aims to examine some of the more interesting aspects of Ctries' inner workings and their relationship to the data structures built-in to Clojure, and to describe the API choices made by ctries.clj to make using them feel natural in Clojure."
