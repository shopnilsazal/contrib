description: "Copy of the slides for this talk are here: https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Panel-WW3.0/DEFCON-20-Corman-Panel-WW3dot0.pdf \n\nWorld War 3.0: Chaos, Control & the Battle for the Net\nJoshua Corman Director of Security Intelligence, Akamai Technologies\nDan Kaminsky\nJeff Moss Founder, DEF CON and Black Hat\nRod Beckstrom\nMichael Joseph Gross Author of the Vanity Fair article 'A Declaration of Cyber-War', Moderator\n\nThere is a battle under way for control of the Internet. Some see it as a fight between forces of Order (who want to superimpose existing, pre-digital power structures and their notions of privacy, intellectual property, security, and sovereignty onto the Net) and forces of Disorder (who want to abandon those old structures and let the will of the crowd control a new global culture). Yet this binary view of the conflict excludes the characters with the best chance of resolving it: those who know that control is impossible and chaos is untenable, a group that Vanity Fair, in an article called \"World War 3.o,\" called \"the forces of Organized Chaos.\" This panel gathers leading proponents of that worldview to discuss urgent issues of Internet governance, which may come to a head later this year in a Dubai meeting of the U.N.'s International Telecommunications Union. If government control and anarchistic chaos online are unacceptable, what exactly do the forces of organized chaos propose as an alternative? And what is the DefCon community's role in helping to realize that vision of the Net?\n\nJoshua Corman is the Director of Security Intelligence for Akamai Technologies and has more than a decade of experience in security. Most recently he served as Research Director for Enterprise Security at The 451 Group following his time as Principal Security Strategist for IBM Internet Security Systems. Mr. Corman's research highlights adversaries, game theory and motivational structures. His analysis cuts across sectors to the core security challenges plaguing the IT industry, and helps to drive evolutionary strategies toward emerging technologies and shifting incentives.\nTwitter: @joshcorman\nhttp://blog.cognitivedissidents.com\n\nDan Kaminsky: I play with toys\nhttp://dankaminsky.com\nTwitter: @dakami\n\nJeff Moss is the founder of DEF CON and Black Hat.\nhttp://defcon.org\nTwitter: @darktangent"
