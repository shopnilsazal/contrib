description: "It's my personal goal to introduce as many people as possible to open-source and make it dead simple for them to contribute.\n\nWhat happens if you have something specific you want to contribute?\n\nThis talk will show you the best practices for discussing features and ideas with ruby-core. We'll show you how to get your high-level concepts imagined through efficient channels of discussion to implementation.\n\nWe should talk about how fear and language barriers play a role in getting the right kind of feedback. We'll also talk about how ruby-core operates with the vast distance between its members.\n\nMost importantly, we'll give you the confidence to work effectively with ruby-core and how we can improve Ruby together.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGY0/"
