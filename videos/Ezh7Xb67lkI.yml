PixieDust speeds up data manipulation and display with features like: Automated local install of Python and Scala kernels running with Spark Realtime Spark Job progress monitoring directly from the Notebook Use Scala directly in your Python notebook. Variables are automatically transferred from Python to Scala and vice-versa Auto-visualisation of Spark DataFrames using popular chart engines like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh, or MapBox Seamless integration to cloud services Create embedded apps with your own visualisations or apps using the PixieDust extensibility APIs Come along and learn how you can use this tool in your own projects to visualise and explore data effortlessly with no coding. If you prefer working with a Scala Notebook, this session is also for you, as PixieDust can also run on a Scala Kernel. Imagine being able to visualise your favourite Python chart engines from a Scala Notebook! This session will end with a demo combining Twitter, Watson Tone Analyser, Spark Streaming, and some fun real-time visualisations - all running within a Notebook.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
