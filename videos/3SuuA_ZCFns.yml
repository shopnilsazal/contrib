recordingDate: 1378232761
description: "Edward W. Felten, Director, Center for Information Technology Policy, and Professor of Computer Science and Public Affairs, Princeton University; former Chief Technologist, U.S. Federal Trade Commission\nPresented at the 22nd USENIX Security Symposium\n\nThis talk will describe the speaker's experience in government, where he served as the first Chief Technologist at the Federal Trade Commission. Technologists often complain that government is broken and policymakers are clueless, but the truth is more complicated. This talk will explain why government works differently, why it can be perfectly fine for policymakers to not understand how the Internet works, how to work effectively with government officials, why legislative strategy is NP-complete, and why we need more technologists to spend time in public service."
