description: "RubyConf 2017: Just when you thought you couldn’t refactor any more… by Claudio B.\n\nIn this talk, we will travel together on a refactoring journey. We will start from code that is easy to write but hard to read, and gradually advance to a level where the 4 C's of good code are satisfied: Correctness, Completeness, Clearness, and Compactness.\n\nOn the way, we will learn new Ruby 2.4 methods (String#match?, MatchData#named_captures) and review old methods (Enumerable#find, Regexp#===) that are more powerful than they seem at a first glance."
