description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #10\n29 November 2017\nSponsored and Hosted by Kenshoo\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nThis talk will discuss how to train a Convolutional Neural Network to detect the main four characters of the Simpsons. We'll go over the main issues in such a project: \n\n- Lack of tagged data, but plenty of images in Google searches, which led me to generate the training set by myself.\n\n- Transfer Learning: using other pre-trained networks as a jump-start in training our model.\n\nThe talk will be followed by some Keras code snippets and highlights from videos that were tagged by the model.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
