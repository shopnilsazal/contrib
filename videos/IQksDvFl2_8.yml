description: "View slide presentation here:\nhttps://github.com/olgabot/pydata2014biodata\n\nPyData NYC 2014\nThe field of biology is constantly evolving new methods for quantification and must constantly adapt to different upstream workflows that quantify biological measurements such as gene expression or alternative splicing. We present flotilla (github.com/YeoLab/flotilla) as a flexible, open source, community-driven software package that enables biologists with a rudimentary knowledge of statistical methods and programming to analyze and visualize hundreds of biological datasets. Users of flotilla harness the power of IPython interactive widgets and Pythonâ€™s scientific stack, and can quickly perform powerful analyses of biological datasets such as dimensionality reduction, covariance analysis, clustering, classification, regression and outlier detection. As a case study, we will present a single-cell RNA-Sequencing analysis use case of flotilla, with data from two publicly available datasets of individual mouse immune cells in response to a stimulus. With these data, we show the utility of flotilla in quantifying the variation of gene expression and mRNA splicing in single cells."
