description: "Softly, softly typing by John Cinnamond\n\nThe ruby community is large and varied but, for the most part, we haven't rushed to engage with type theory. Static typing - whatever that is - is for the slow moving world of Java developers. Type theory is for Haskell weirdos.\n\nAll that could be about to change.\n\nIn his keynote at Rubyconf 2014 Matz spoke about some ideas for Ruby 3, including the idea of adding static typing - or more specifically soft typing - to the language. So what is soft typing? How do we understand more about it? And what does it mean for us mere developers?\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H0zo/"
