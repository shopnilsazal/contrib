description: 'Monitoring systems has traditionally been the responsibility of Ops teams. But our goal is to align devs, ops, & other roles in the organization (aka DevOps), so we need to ensure they are all monitoring critical business systems & do so in ways that take advantage of the unique perspective that each role offers. In this session, I’ll break down the expansive monitoring landscape into 5 categories that each provide a unique view of your systems. I’ll show how each category allows your team to have complete observability, avoid blind spots, & work together to quickly resolve issues & outages.'
