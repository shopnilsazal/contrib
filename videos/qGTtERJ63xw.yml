description: "By Heiko Rupp\r\n\r\nJopr is the open source systems management and monitoring platform from JBoss / Red Hat. While it is specially tailored towards JBoss projects, it can be easily extended in various ways.\r\n\r\nThis talk will present the Jopr / RHQ system and its architecture and then talk about the extension points and how to write extensions for monitoring, management and alerting.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will also talk about the relation to RHQ-project.org, which used to be the upstream to Jopr and which now includes the Jopr bits.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
