description: "Teli Brown: Phishing, it starts with \"Ph\" for a reason.'Some best practices to detect and prevent for some new point of attack methods\n\n\"Phishing, it starts with 'Ph' for a reason. Some best practices to detect and prevent for some new point of attack methods. When banks and other financial institutions tell their customers to only give personal information (e.g.: Credit Card, Social Security Number, ETC) via the telephone, because of online attacks from phishers, that's when phishers get creative and go back to what the root of phishing has been and blend it with some new technologies. \n\nBio: Teli Brown has done Security consulting for major telecommunications companies, aiding in tracking terrorist and malicious telephone users. He has also done massive amounts of testing with number delivery in SS7, and was able to identify and backtrace the flaw in SS7 that allowed people the ability to change their \"Charge Number\". Now spends his time consulting for small businesses for voice services."
