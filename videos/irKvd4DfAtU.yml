description: "I secretly think that NoSQL data stores are rabbits. They're breeding under the floorboards when we're asleep. How else do you explain a landscape that includes Redis, Riak, CouchDB, Tokyo Cabinet, Flock, MongoDB, and Cassandra, among many others? Mopsy and Cottontail can't be far behind.\n\nGiven this, picking the right rabâ€¦ er, data store for your project can be a challenge. There are lots of factors to consider, such as tail fluffiness, consistency guarantees, replication strategies, and ear length.\n\nBut the Ruby API for the data store is important too. That's what you'll be dealing with day in and day out once you make your choice. If you can't stand the interface, you'll get sick of cleaning the cage pretty quickly.\n\nIn this talk, I'll run you through the mechanics of accessing several NoSQL data stores with Ruby. I promise not to bring a rabbit to the conference, and I definitely won't bring two. The last thing we need is more.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GZSh/"
