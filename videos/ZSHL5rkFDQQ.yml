description: "\"Scientific computing  using Cython: Best of both Worlds!\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - Anfiteatro 2]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nCython is not only an excellent and widely used tool to speed up computational Python code, itâ€™s also a very smart way to talk to native code and libraries. The Cython compiler translates Python code to C or C++ code, and supports static type annotations to allow direct use of C/C++ data types and functions. You get the best of both worlds while working with Cython: Python like syntax with blazing fast C speed.\n\nThis talk/tutorial by a Python/Cython developer introduces Cython programming language and leads the participants all the way from their first Python extension to an efficient integration with native C. \nTopics covered will be:\n1. Using the Cython compiler to build a native extension module\n2. Cython development from Jupyter notebook\n3. Mixing Python with static C types in the Cython language\n4. Calling into native code from Cython code (Brief introduction)\n5. Wrap up: A brief case study\nCyvlfeat: A Cython/Python wrapper for Computer Vision library, VLFeat.\n\nParticipants are expected to have a good understanding of the Python language, some basic knowledge about C or C++.  No deep C programming knowledge is required, nor is any prior knowledge needed about writing extension modules for the CPython runtime.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
