title: 'How Open Source Powers Facebook on Android (en) - Simon Stewart, Facebook - Droidcon Paris 2014'
recordingDate: 1412673538
description: "Droidcon Paris 2014 \nSimon Stewart, Facebook\n\nThere are hundreds of software engineers working on Facebook’s Android application. The codebase is large, and the pace of change is unrelenting. Despite the complexity of size and rapid development, a new alpha release that’s known to be solid is shipped three times a week. We’d not be able to go this fast, or scale our development team this effectively, without using large amounts of OSS.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll discuss the Open Source tools that help us build Facebook for Android, how we contribute technology to OSS, and how we do our best to be good citizens in the broader OSS world. I’ll do this by looking at the full life cycle of a release, going from how we organize our source, do code reviews in phabricator, through building using tools such as Buck, to how we’ve improved the quality of our releases using OSS testing tools such as Selendroid."
