description: "Keynote: Consequences of an Insightful Algorithm by Carina C. Zona\n\nCoders have ethical responsibilities. We can extract remarkably precise intuitions about people. Do we have a right to know what they didn't consent to share, even when they shared data leading us there? Balancing human needs and business specs can be tough. How do we mitigate against unintended outcomes? In this talk, we look at examples of uncritical programming, & painful results of using insightful data in ways that were benignly intended. You'll learn practices for examining how code might harm individuals. Weâ€™ll look at how to flip the paradigm, for consequences that are better for all."
