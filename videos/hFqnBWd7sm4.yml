description: "By Howard Abrams\nIn our company, we use OpenStack as a private cloud. We stand up and manage collections of OpenStack deployments and move both our company code and the \"stack\" its lives on through a workflow of staging servers, with each release a \"dark launch\" in miniature.\n\nAs if that complexity wasn't enough, different company teams had requirements for different types of access and tailored data reports. We \"wrapped\" the current OpenStack APIs and user interfaces to provide more granular interfaces to these teams while still appeasing our security group.\n\nThis session shows how we accomplished our goals with OpenStack software, including demonstrating the software, tools and processes, as well as the lessons we learned from the experience.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0H/"
