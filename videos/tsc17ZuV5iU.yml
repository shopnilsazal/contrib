title: 'Cloud Native Networking for Containers in AWS using CNI Plugins - Anirudh Aithal'
recordingDate: 1525452552
description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nCloud Native Networking for Containers in AWS using CNI Plugins - Anirudh Aithal, Amazon Web Services (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nThe Container networking interface (CNI) project makes it really simple for container orchestrators to configure networking for containers. In this presentation, Anirudh Aithal will provide a detailed walkthrough of developing a plugin, from prototyping to integrating with orchestration frameworks such as Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS). We'll start with a brief introduction of CNI project and plugins. We will also review how CNI plugins enabled us to iterate fast on enabling cloud-native networking capabilities for containers such as routable IPs, network ACLs, firewall rules by provisioning elastic network interfaces on a per-container basis, without modifications to the orchestration framework itself. We will also review the best practices for developing a plugin including testing, logging, versioning and operationalizing the same.\n\nAbout Anirudh\nAnirudh is a Sr. Software Engineer in the Container Services team at AWS. He has been involved with bringing many of the virtual machine abstractions to containers running on AWS including elastic network interfaces, identity and access management and telemetry. He's also a maintainer of a number of projects/github repositories including the CNI plugins (https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cni-plugins and https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s) and the ECS agent (https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent)"
