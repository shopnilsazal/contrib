description: "In an industry that does so much to uncover and expose the mistakes of others. Which don’t get me wrong is a valuable service in helping to increase security by the discovery of these vulnerabilities. It seems everyone though is very shy about pointing out their own failures! I’ve decided that I could help teach others valuable lessons I learned by showcasing failures I’ve had in Blue Team. failures I’ve had in Red Team and failures I’ve had in this community. I once read that a smart person learns from their mistakes. A wise person learns from the mistakes of others! So please take a moment to listen to me trying to help you become a little bit wiser.\n\nBIO:\nJayson E. Street is an author of the “Dissecting the hack: Series”. Also the DEF CON Groups Global Coordinator. He has also spoken at DEF CON, DerbyCon, UCON and at several other ‘CONs and colleges on a variety of Information Security subjects. His life story can be found on Google under “Jayson E. Street” *He is a highly carbonated speaker who has partaken of Pizza from Beijing to Brazil.
