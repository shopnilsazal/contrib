description: "DEF CON 16 - Brenno J.S.A.A.F. de Winter: Hacking Data Retention: Small Sister your digital privacy self defense.\nOver the last couple of years a range of privacy threats have been in occurring. Europe is starting to look like the playing field of what is to come to the US: Storage of all e-mail traffic, online presence, phone calls, actual traveling throughout nations and filtering of content. Fortunately a closer look at the measures shows that it is never smart to overestimate the abilities European governments have and digital self defense is possible. But since we don't want to underestimate the threat as well. So that's why we look how these measures effects can be greatly reduced and how we can have fun online again. This knowledge is something we probably want to extend to many people to help them reclaim their digital rights with the use of simple and existing technologies. The Small Sister Project shows you how to do that and delivers the tools to make that easier. Learn how simple measures can make a huge difference.\n\nBrenno De Winter started experimenting with security at the age of 9.
