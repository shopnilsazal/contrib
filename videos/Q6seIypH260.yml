title: 'Code the Docs: Interactive Document Environments'
recordingDate: 1471256454
description: "Paris Buttfield-Addison\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/184/view_talk\nDistributing example code and applications with documentation is now easy. There are a million different ways to get code to people: from zips, to GitHub, to gists, and beyond. Code is easy to distribute. But how do we create a better link between example code, and written documentation?\r\nLuckily, clever boffins have come up with some solutions: interactive document environments. These let the live code and the documentation sit side-by-side with one another, the distributed example code is the documentation.\r\n\r\nThis talk will take a brief look at some of the different interactive document environments out there – mainly Jupyter, IPython Notebooks, and Swift Playgrounds – and the various strengths, weaknesses, and caveats of these tools. We’ll also explore the future, and discuss where these tools are going, as well as the implications for technical documentation. Learn how to add interactivity to your documentation, and why this might be a good idea!"
