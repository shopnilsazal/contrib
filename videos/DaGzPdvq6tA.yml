title: '#HITB2018AMS D2T1 - Establishing Covert Channels By Abusing GSM AT Commands - A. Munoz & J. C. Saez'
recordingDate: 1524985038
description: "From the ’60s and ’70s, the hacker community started to design tools and procedures in order to take advantage of telephone networks (such as blue boxes, phreaking, etc.). These old school hacking techniques are coming back with the commercialization of cheap open hardware which establish new threats.\n\nIn this talk, we are going to contextualize some phreaking practices and introduce new threats including a way to modify the behaviour of GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) antennas in a mobile phones using AT commands to establish covert channels. \n\nWe will show that it is possible to transfer information without paying and we will demonstrate how we can establish a covert channel without a ‘standard GSM connection’ and still send tens of bits per minute without incurring any costs.\n\n=== \n\nPhD in Telecommunications Engineering by Technical University of Madrid(UPM) and postdoc researcher in network security by Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M). He has been a senior security researcher for more than 10 years and has published more than 60 academic publications (IEEE, ACM, JCR, hacking conferences…), books and computer security tools.\n\nHe has also worked in advanced projects with European Organisms, public bodies and multinational companies (global 500). For over a decade, he has been involved in security architecture design, penetration tests, forensic analysis, mobile and wireless environments, and information security research (leading technical and scientific teams).\n\nAlfonso frequently takes part as a speaker in hacking conferences (STIC CCN-CERT, DeepSec, HackInTheBox, Virus Bulletin, RootedCon, 8.8, No cON Name, GSICKMinds, Cybercamp, Secadmin, JNIC, Ciberseg,X1RedMasSegura, Navaja Negra) and commercial and academic security conferences (+60 talks). He is certified by CISA (Certified Information Systems Auditor), CEHv8 (Certified Ethical Hacker), CHFIv8 (Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator) and CES (Certified Encryption Specialist). Several academic and professional awards.\n\nYou can find him on Twitter: @mindcrypt / @criptored\n\n--- \n\nJorge has a Bsc. in Computer Science by the University of Valladolid (UVa) and Masters in Cyber security by the University Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M).He is currently working in a cybersecurity and innovation laboratory as a researcher."
