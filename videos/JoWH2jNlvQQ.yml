description: "Elegant programming constructions and mathematical theories like LISP and lambda calculus often look timeless and universal. They are not invented, but discovered! If there are intelligent aliens, they will sooner or later run into formal logics and computation and, shortly thereafter, discover lambda calculus and LISP. Or will they?\n\nTo answer this question, we can look at the vast literature of philosophy of mathematics. In this talk, Tomas will give a gentle overview of some of the most important ideas and discuss how they apply to programming.\n\nIt turns out that there are plenty of reasons to believe that lambda calculus is invented and aliens might never invent it, especially if they are at least a bit interesting!\n\nMore details here: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2017/tomas-petricek"
