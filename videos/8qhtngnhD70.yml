description: "We all know data is growing at a rapid pace and our ability to store it has become cheap. But what do we do with all this data? Do you feel overwhelmed with the infinite amounts of decisions you could make?\n\nBig data was supposed to improve how businesses run, though in most cases it has complicated process. We have become apathetic to the amounts of data that are bombarding us.\n\nThis talk aims to help overcome this apathy towards the sheer amount of information out there. It will teach you how to come up with methods to finding metrics, and new dashboards specifically for your business.\n\nWe will talk about:\n\n   Backward induction, or goal based metrics.\n   Classification algorithms for making sense of data.\n   Graphing in higher dimensions.\n\nBy the end of this session, you will know how to be effective with data. You will understand how to find what you are looking for, how to classify it, and how to visually make sense of it all.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGdR/"
