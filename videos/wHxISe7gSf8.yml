description: "by  Josh Sokol, Information Security Program Owner of National Instruments\n\nAbstract: \nThe best part about creating new products and services in the cloud is the agility that it provides. Your company literally can scale at the click of a button. But if you take the simplicity of the cloud for granted, you wind up with brittle security that even a novice adversary can overcome. This talk will focus on identifying the holes in your cloud application before the attackers do, closing those gaps, and building architectures that can withstand the barrage of attacks that the Internet will throw at it.\n\nJosh Sokol, CISSP, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BS in Computer Science in 2002. Since that time, he has worked for several large companies, including AMD and BearingPoint, spent some time as a military contractor, and is currently employed as the Information Security Program Owner at National Instruments. In his current role, Sokol manages all compliance, security architecture, risk management, and vulnerability management activities for NI. Sokol created the free and open source risk management tool named SimpleRisk, has spoken on dozens of security topics including the much-hyped “HTTPS Can Byte Me” talk at Black Hat 2010, and currently serves on the OWASP Global Board of Directors.\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
