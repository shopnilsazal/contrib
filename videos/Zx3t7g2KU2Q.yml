description: "PyData DC 2016\n\nWhile databases like MongoDB don't require a formal schema, there's still a schema somewhere. It might be merely implied by validation rules in the code. Or, there might be a more formal representation. In some cases, the lack of strict schema creates a dynamic flexibility that creates value rapidly. Other times, the lack of formal structures leads to chaos. How can we find a balance?"
