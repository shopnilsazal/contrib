description: "Saving Ruby from the Apocalypse by Jason Charnes\n\nYou've just woken from a coma to find out that Ruby has fallen victim to the programming apocalypse. Walkers have taken over the programming world looking to infect any developers they can find. Posing even more of a threat are the other survivor camps such as Java and PHP all fighting to survive by any means necessary.\n\nAfter reuniting with the Ruby Community, it's time to fight for survival. Ruby developers who remained safe in the post-apocalyptic Ruby community need a leader to keep the community together and keep the language thriving. Are you willing to step up to keep Ruby alive?"
