description: "Filmed at PyData London 2017\n\nDescription\nThis talk discusses static type analysis applied to Python data products, its pros and cons, and overall how to adopt type checking tools (i.e. mypy) in your workflow.\n\nAbstract\nAs a dynamically typed language, Python is an extremely flexible tool that allows to write code quickly and concisely. This flexibility makes Python a popular tool for R&D and prototyping, but what about bringing Data Science in production? When comparing Python to statically typed languages, one of the downsides is that many type-related errors are not captured until runtime.\n\nThis talk discusses the steps taken by the Python community to promote static type analysis, in particular the semantic definition of type hints and the adoption of mypy as type checking tool.\n\nThe audience will learn about static typing for Python, its pros and cons, and how to adopt static type analysis in your workflow. Since the focus is on building and deploying data products, static type analysis is discussed as a mean to improve the robustness of your data products.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
