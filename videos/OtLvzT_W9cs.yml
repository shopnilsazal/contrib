description: "Rich Murphey - Intrusion Prevention Techniques on Windows and Unix\nIntrusion Prevention Techniques on Windows and Unix\n\nWhat exactly is intrusion prevention and why the heck should we care? This talk surveys some of the common features of Intrusion Prevention systems, largely constrained by architectural layering of Windows and Unix kernels We then look at a case study of intrusion prevention and discuss how it differs from IDS, Firewall, AV, and others.\n\nRich Murphey was a founding core team member of FreeBSD and Xfree86. He received a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Rice University, was on the Faculty of the University of Texas Medical School in Galveston, and was Chief Scientist at PentaSafe Security Technologies.
