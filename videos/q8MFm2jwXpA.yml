description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nKubernetes Advanced Scheduling — For Heating Showers? - Robert Carosi, Spotify, Ad van der Veer & Boris Mattijssen, Nerdalize B.V. (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nIn this talk, Ad van der Veer and and Boris Mattijssen, software engineers at Nerdalize, will talk about building custom schedulers. The goal is that after this talk attendees understand how to build their own a custom scheduler, and are familiar with the tools to do so. As an example they will use a heat-aware scheduler that was developed by Nerdalize to allow them to schedule compute jobs to servers where more heat is needed. This unique need arises from the situation that Nerdalize builds a distributed datacenter, where servers are placed into households, and double as water heaters. After someone takes a shower, their boiler needs to be re-heated. This scheduler allows us to move high-cpu workloads to those servers.\n\nAbout Boris\nBoris Mattijssen is Software Engineer at Nerdalize B.V. a Dutch company. He is also a masters’ student Computer science and the main author of the Custom “Heat aware” Scheduler. Previous speaking experience: Deltares Software Days - Delft\n\nAbout Ad\nProduct designer by education, software Nerd by nature. Ad is a pro in designing and developing simple software products that solve complicated problems. Ad has worked with Docker since 2013 and, since then, touched almost every part of the container ecosystem while developing many backend applications in Go: his weapon of choice. At Nerdalize Ad does his part in developing our cloud products by combining new ideas with proven technologies and making sure end users have the best experience possible.\n\nAbout Robert\nRobert is a graduate intern at Spotify. \nWorking on his master thesis: 'Leveraging distributed tracing in service meshes for application profiling at scale.'"
