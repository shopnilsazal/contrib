description: "Hacking Development Culture: Treating Developers As People\n\nI work at a growing company where the main \"money-making\" app was a monolithic and upgraded over time from a Ruby on Rails 1 codebase. Working in a fast moving startup where stopping for six months to rewrite is NOT an option. The development culture at the time revolved around simply passing QA and getting features out the door. On top of that, finding seasoned Rails developers to help mend the codebase are rare and hard to hire. All or any of this sound familiar? This is our story of how I balanced and satisfied management's requirements of getting new features out the door but at the same time shaping a rag tag group of developers and turned us into a well oiled machine where now code-quality, code reviews, pair programming, and test driven development are part of the development culture.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HTA2/"
