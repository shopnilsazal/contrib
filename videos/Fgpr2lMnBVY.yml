description: "You Have Stateful Apps - What if Kubernetes Would Also Run Your Storage? - Annette Clewett & Sudhir Prasad, Red Hat\n\nKubernetes supports Stateful Applications by connecting to your existing storage. But what if you don’t have any? Or the storage capabilities differs between your environments? Wouldn’t it be nice if Kubernetes itself would be able provide storage services without any external dependency from Day1?\n\ngluster-kubernetes is an umbrella project, currently being submitted for inclusion in CNCF, tying together various open source technologies to do just this. It takes the concept of “container-native storage” literally and orchestrates containerized GlusterFS, a scalable, software-defined storage solution to provide object storage, file storage and block storage for your applications. In this session you will learn about the components in play and how they make Kubernetes provide Persistent Storage and S3 Object Storage that scales with the cluster and runs everywhere.\n\nAbout Annette Clewett\nRed Hat Storage Architect with broad knowledge across a spectrum of technologies – network, storage, virtual, and platform. Have successfully delivered countless studies that improved end-user experience and created more efficient and available infrastructures. Current projects include creating and documenting reference architectures for container-native storage in the cloud, on virtual, or bare metal.\n\nAbout Sudhir Prasad\nSudhir drives Container Native Storage and Container Ready Storage Red Hat portfolio for Kubernetes. Before joining Red Hat, Sudhir led Product Management and Strategy at Violin Memory and led Manageability product portfolio for automation & orchestration at NetApp. Before moving to product management, Sudhir was Principal Engineer & Software Architect at NetApp and HP. As engineering lead his focus was on system architecture & design, high availability, manageability, simplicity, and workflow automation"
