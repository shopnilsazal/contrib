description: "StankDawg, Hacking Google AdWords\n\nThe AdWords program is an advertising system used by Google. It is a pay-per-click system like may others but Google doesn't give it the attention to design that it deserves. Not only does Google take some liberties with the Terms of Service and what they allow and don't allow in the program, but also have several flaws in the logical design of the system. There are several loopholes in this system and they will be explained and demonstrated with proof of concepts for every example.\n\nStankDawg is a senior programmer/analyst who has worked for Fortune 500 companies and large universities. He is a staff writer for 2600 Magazine, blacklisted411, and numerous websites. He has given presentations at HOPE, Interz0ne, and other local venues and has also appeared on television. He is founder of \"The Digital Dawg Pound\" (the DDP) which is a group of white-hat/gray-hat hackers who produce their own magazine, radio shows, TV show, and numerous other projects at http://www.binrev.com/"
