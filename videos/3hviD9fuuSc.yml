description: "Menhir and Friends: the State of the Art of Parsing in Rust by Naomi Testard\n\nIn this talk we present Menhir, a very powerful LR parsers generator, and how to use it to write Rust parsers (and lexers). We also show some details of the internals of Menhirâ€™s backend for Rust, as well as a short comparative survey of other similar parsing tools and techniques for Rust out here."
