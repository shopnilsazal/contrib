description: "BRINGING BACK THE 1990S: THE REVENGE OF JAVASCRIPT STYLE SHEETS\n\nJavaScript Style Sheets were an early competitor to CSS. Spoiler alert: CSS won. In the decades since, JSSS has had a growing influence on how we thinking about styling web applications. CSS and SASS cribbed a few moves from JSSS and some emerging approaches are set to bring it back from the dead.\n\nSTEVE KINNEY\n\nSteve is the founding director of the Front-End Engineering Program at the Turing School of Software and Design in Denver, Colorado where he teaches JavaScript and other technologies to aspiring developers. \n\nHe’s also the lead organizer for DinosaurJS, which is also part of the JSConf Family of Conferences. He’s slowly, but surely, writing a book on Electron. He is a recovering New York City public school teacher and recently learned how to drive a car. Definitely not a lizard."
