description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://gsec.hitb.org/materials/sg2015/\n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\nSecurity is a property of human outcomes, not technical systems. The security community understands how to think about the security of code and is learning how to think about the security of large systems, but has barely begun to start to think about how to improve security outcomes for humans. Security for humans affects the entire software development and deployment lifecycle, but it’s most strongly present in the design and requirements phase where it has been largely ignored by the security community. The need for outcome-oriented security design is particularly obvious in the design of systems intended for use by high-risk, specifically-targeted users. In this talk, we’ll describe the security design problem, the challenges of supporting high-risk users, and some steps toward practical processes and solutions for the missing discipline in the security community.\n\nABOUT ELEANOR SAITTA\n\nEleanor Saitta is a hacker, designer, artist, writer, and barbarian.  She makes a living and a vocation of understanding how complex systems operate and redesigning them to work, or at least fail, better.  Her work is transdisciplinary, using everything from electronics, software, and paint to social rules and words as media with which to explore and shape our interactions with the world.  Her focuses include the seamless integration of technology into the lived experience, the humanity of objects and the built environment, and systemic resilience and conviviality.\n\nEleanor is Technical Director at the International Modern Media Institute (IMMI), a member of the advisory boards at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, Geeks Without Bounds (GWoB), the IFTF Governance Futures Lab, and the Calyx Institute, is part of the Trike and Briar/Bramble software projects, and works occasionally as a freelance security architecture and strategy consultant to news organizations, NGOs, and software teams like Mailpile and Commotion.\n\nPrior to this, she was Principal Security Engineer at the Open Internet Tools Project (OpenITP), directing the OpenITP Peer Review Board for open source software and working on adversary modeling, and also had a long career in the commercial security consulting space.  She also previously co-founded the Constitutional Analysis Support Team (CAST) and the Seattle-based Public N3rd Area hacker space."
