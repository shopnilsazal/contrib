title: 'Is Python ready for the Enterprise? by Ryan Stuart'
recordingDate: 1438658621
description: "There seems to be an opinion among some developers that Python isn't suitable for Enterprise. To put it another way, Python is great for small tasks where a scripting language works well, but not so suitable for more complicated software stacks. This talk tries to address some of these concerns. Specifically, we will look at:\r\n\r\n* Python Typing System for large code bases.\r\n* Is the GIL a problem?\r\n* The speed of Python execution.\r\n* The speed of Python development.\r\n* A case study: Caterpillar.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nJuly 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
