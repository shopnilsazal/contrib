description: "Manage Your Energy, Not Your Time by Joe Mastey\n\nHigh-tech culture is obsessed with managing time. In fact, if there’s one thing that we spend as much time on as actual work, it’s getting the most out of that work time. But here, like elsewhere, choosing the wrong optimization does more harm than good. Wringing every minute out of your day is more likely to burn you out than to turn you into a code-producing machine. Instead, we need to get better at managing our energy. Put down the kitchen timer, because in this talk you’ll learn about better research-driven approaches to get more out of work and life."
