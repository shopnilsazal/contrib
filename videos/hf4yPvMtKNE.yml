title: 'Clojure Conj 2012 - Challenges for Logic Programming'
recordingDate: 1433268254
description: "Challenges for Logic Programming by: Steve Miner\n\nThe core.logic library (a port of miniKANREN) has sparked an interest in logic programming among Clojure users. Back in the '80s, logic programming inspired the Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Systems Project, which was poised to leap past the rest of the world, but it didn't work out that way. In this talk, we'll review \"What Went Wrong\" (from Hewitt's infamous paper). We'll discuss some of the challenges that logic programming faces today and how Clojure might help."
