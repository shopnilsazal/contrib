recordingDate: 1458612162
description: "Many progressive IT organizations have already adopted agile methodologies and run in a CI/CD mode, while security processes and a level of security automation are still behind and can easily become a bottleneck if not changed.\n\nWe’ll show in our presentation how to convert the old approach to application security to a more progressive and a faster one. You will also learn how to extend a leverage of a small security team by utilizing QA regression unit tests for security processes. Achieving a greater level of productivity and security automation by utilizing open source and commercial tools will be also covered in our talk.\n\nOleg Gryb\nSamsung Strategy and Innovation Center\nSr. Manager, Security Engineering\nOleg Gryb is Security Architect working in the application security domain at Samsung Electronics Innovation Center.
