description: "WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT A MONAD? FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING FOR PEOPLE WHO HATE MATH\n\nFunctional programming means cleaner code, easier maintenance, and simpler testing, but most of us will never use it because it’s explained in such a complex, mathematical, and confusing way. This talk explains how we can get the benefits of functional programming today — no math required.\n\nJASON LENGSTORF\n\nJason Lengstorf is a developer, designer, author, and friendly bear. He’s worked in nearly every role in an agency and uses his 14+ years of experience to offer a unique, cross-functional approach to solving complex problems. He has written several books and dozens of tutorials about development, built and sold a successful web agency, and created award-winning web projects for companies including PlayStation, Intel, and Precision Nutrition. \n\nJason is passionate about building better careers by first focusing on building better lives. He focuses on work-life balance, efficiency, processes, and productivity to help people get more done in less time — so they can spend more time on the things that matter most. Jason recently joined IBM Design as a senior front-end developer and mentor to new hires, where he hopes to scale this philosophy throughout one of the largest companies in the world. \n\nHe lives in Austin, TX, spends most of his disposable income on food and travel, and can often be spotted in the forest foraging for nuts and berries."
