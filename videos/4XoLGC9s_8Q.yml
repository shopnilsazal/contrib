description: "by Pascal Chevrel\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nA community building project around the Firefox Nightly Channel\n\nEvery day, we compile the code for Firefox on our master branch, mozilla-central, and generate builds without the Firefox branding, those are calledFirefox Nightly build. Until recently, those builds were barely mentionned orpromoted on mozilla.org, localized versions existed but were only known to thelocalizers themselves, the download page was on a separate domain and hadn'tbeen redesigned since 2011.\n\nAs a result, we have very few Firefox Nightly users.\n\nWhat would be the impact for Mozilla if Firefox Nightly became a first-classcitizen among Firefox channels? How about getting back more technical users onthis channel reporting bugs as they get introduced into our codebase insteadof weeks or months later? Could we ship faster and better quality software ifwe had an army of Nightly testers reporting regressions and giving theirfeedback on a daily basis? How about engaging our existing community of power-users directly into the production process for Firefox as a long termparticipation project?\n\nThis talk is a recap of what the release management team has been working onin the last 8 months to turn the nightly channel in a more useful toolleveraging our existing community to ship a better Firefox and what we expectto do in 2017 around the nightly channel to serve our QA needs.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 10:00:00"
