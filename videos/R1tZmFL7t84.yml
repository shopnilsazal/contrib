description: "Alyvix: Under the hood Visual synthetic monitoring of network applications that work through proprietary protocols\nby Francesco Melchiori\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe open-source software Alyvix is a synthetic monitoring system, based oncomputer vision. It automates any application, interacting with GUIs exactlyas a human would do. In this way, Alyvix can check the availability and canmeasure the responsiveness of applications. From a computer science point ofview, Alyvix is an open-source Python-based software, which can be deployed onWindows 64-bit machines as a part of an open-stack of libraries. Alyvix mainlyrelies on the following open-source software projects: RobotFramework fordesktop automation, OpenCV and Pillow for image processing, TesseractOCR fortext recognition and PyQt for GUI programming. Francesco Melchiori, as Alyvixproduct manager, will explain how Alyvix works leveraging on theaforementioned packages, what software design choices have been taken.Finally, he will show how this computer vision solution solves the need of aneffective visual synthetic monitoring of proprietary network applications.This aims to suggest other use cases with the Alyvix API.\n\nThe open-source software Alyvix is a synthetic monitoring system, based oncomputer vision. It automates any application, interacting with GUIs exactlyas a human would do. In this way, Alyvix can check the availability and canmeasure the responsiveness of applications. Network applications suffer oflatencies, or even downtimes, because of many factors having to deal with thecomplexity of data communications, for example client software, protocols,telecommunication channels, backend hardware resources, etc. Monitoringapplication performances from the end user perspective is the first step forkeeping high the quality of the provided services. Alyvix provides GUI toolsto reproduce user interaction flows on any application, interacting throughmouse clicking, text typing or shortcut sending. Alyvix is not hardwired toapplication APIs but acts like a human user sitting in front of the monitor.Therefore, it is able to automate every on-premise or cloud application afterhaving built so-called test cases. Alyvix checks the availability of networkapplications and measures their responsiveness. Hence, it outputs how longtransactions take to be accomplished and reports the corresponding performancedata in HTML pages. In case of test failures, these reports will show ananimation of the broken transaction visually describing what has gone wrong.Through the integration with any monitoring system, for example Nagios orIcinga, performance time series charts can be created to recognize latencyspikes and service downtimes. Alyvix certifies the ongoing quality of serviceand highlights when and in which location it is higher or lower than expected.Thanks to these insights, IT operations teams can modulate infrastructureresources and IT clients can check their SLA with providers.
