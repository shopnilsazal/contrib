description: "By, Ben Klang\nWhen you want to talk to someone, where do you turn? Skype? Slack or HipChat? Maybe even an old-fashioned telephone? As great (or not) as these are, they all fail in one important way: Context. As developers, why donâ€™t we enable our users to communicate where they are doing everything else, right inside the browser or mobile app? The technology to make contextual communications is evolving quickly with exciting technologies like WebRTC, speech recognition and natural language processing. This talk is about how to apply those building blocks and bring contextual communication to your apps."
