description: "AppSec California 2015 - Day 1, Track 2, Slot 6\n\nTitle\n\nWe All Know What You Did Last Summer: Privacy and the Internet of Things\n\nAbstract\n\nThe devices we carry and systems we interact with on a daily basis generate a lot of information about us. This data includes financial and medical information, location data, personal connections, images and other data. Although you may think this information is private and secure, the data is often accessible to advertisers, hackers and others with malicious intent. One small piece of data is all it takes to unlock a wealth of information about you. Security researcher Ken Westin will be illustrating this point showing tools and techniques he has used in actual cases to track and convict criminals and then how those same tools can be used by criminals to track you. He will also show how personal data compromised in data breaches is sold and used against us as well and the role businesses can play in mitigating these risks to their customers.\n\nBio\n\nKen is a security researcher with 14 years experience building and breaking things through the use/misuse of technology. His technology exploits and endeavors have been featured in Forbes, Good Morning America, Dateline, New York Times, The Economist and has won awards from MIT, CTIA, Oregon Technology Awards, SXSW, Entrepreneur and named in Portland Business Journal’s 2013 “40 Under 40″.
