description: "Web Testing with Logic Programming by: Daniel Gregoire\n\nThere are a plethora of libraries and frameworks for authoring tests at all levels, but how do we test complex application states? Higher-level tests that need to verify complex scenarios tend to result in sequential, nested conditional logic that is both hard to read and does not represent the intention of a test: to verify the state of an application at a snapshot in time. Logic programming, like that provided by core.logic, provides one solution to this problem by providing a declarative syntax for asserting facts about a system. The logic engine can then prove the veracity of tests composed with core.logic (do the facts add up?), or can infer further facts about the system, which provides a new level of expressivity around the values we test. This presentation will use the clj-webdriver and webdriver-logic libraries to demonstrate these concepts by running tests against an application in a full web browser."
