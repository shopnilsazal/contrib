Once you get the hang of it, Scapy makes it easy to target a specific box or a whole network, and whether you have physical access or remote penetration, you can use MITM to open up new possibilities.\n\nBIO: Bob Simpson (Twitter: @bobby_simpson) is CIO for Finley & Cook, PLLC, a private accounting firm.
