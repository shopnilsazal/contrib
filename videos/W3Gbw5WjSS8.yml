Its the first major upgrade to a movie's image in more than 50 years, and it has brought new standards of quality, security, and technology into your local theater complex. This talk will cover what the new BIG PICTURE is all about, the changes made from film, both in the image and sound, and the new security methods involved that help prevent piracy. 3D and alternative content will also be discussed. Come see where the technology stands, and where it is going, and how to get the most out of your movie going experience.\n\nMike Renlund has been a fan of movies ever since he can remember. In 2001 he made the jump from online digital content to movies exhibition. For the past several years Mike has been working with major equipment manufacturers and studios to advance the field and bring a better experience to the masses. Mike has consulted for national and local chains in repair and design of digital cinema systems and installing new equipment. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
