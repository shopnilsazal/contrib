title: 'Reaktor Breakpoint 2018: Harri Santamala, Bad weather - good autonomous vehicles'
recordingDate: 1528978628
description: "Nobody denies that autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to make our traffic safer and more efficient. However, weather plays a critical role in the performance of AVs. During heavy rain, fog, or snow, most of the current AVs and ADAS sensors and algorithms function very poorly, if at all.\n\nVarying weather causes a new level of problems for AVs when it comes to perception, mapping, and dynamic control. This is especially relevant when we are ready to consider giving AVs full control over our daily mobility needs. After all, who would invest in a fleet of taxis if the driver is incapable of driving during the rainy season?\n\nAs autonomous vehicles are not limited by the narrow frequency of visible light, their vision can be enhanced by using a full spectrum of sensors. The solution to SAE L4-L5 snowtonomous driving lies in using smart sensor fusion supported lidar to enable true self-driving.\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018.

He is leading the company towards commercial shared driverless mobility systems."
