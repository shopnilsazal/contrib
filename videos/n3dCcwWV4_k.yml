description: "PyData London 2018\n\nFinding documents that are almost exact duplicates is difficult. Exact hashing algorithms do not work and pairwise comparisons do not scale. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is a scalable method for detecting near duplicate content that allows computation to be exchanged for accuracy. I will present the theoretical side of LSH and an open source Python implementation of the technique.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
