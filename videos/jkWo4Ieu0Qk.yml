description: 'Unit testing is nice, but without a proper integration testing you might not know how your application will behave once it''s deployed to the real environment. Before the Docker, configuring the environment for integration testing was painful – people were using fake database implementations, mocking servers, usually it wasn''t cross-platform as well. But now, we can easily prepare the environment with Docker for our tests. In this talk I would like to spread the word about TestContainers ( https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java ) – a Java library that supports JUnit tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container. A year ago we (ZeroTurnaround) decided to join our Docker-based test engine and TestContainers, and now it''s open-sourced, available to everyone, so you can test your apps like we do :)'
