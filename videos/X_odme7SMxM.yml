description: "There's More To a Partner Than the API by Jacques Fu | Stever Karp\n\nBuilding a product is hard. Partners can make that experience easier or more challenging depending on what they bring to the table. Our experience in building a payment platform has taught us that choosing partners and service providers is just as important if not more so than choosing your stack. We want to share our learnings and war stories from the frontline.\n\n​​A great partner adds strategic value, works with you to align roadmaps and provide visibility into the changing landscape (from their perspective), and shares their deep technical experience with you to improve collaboration and mutual benefit. A partner is more than just a SaaS API.\n\n​​These are some of our experiences with what works and doesn't work, and some red flags that you should look out for."
