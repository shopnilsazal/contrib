recordingDate: 1464793277
description: "PyData Berlin 2016\n\nThe development of large-scale Knowledge Base (KB) has drawn lots of attentions and efforts from both academy and industries recently . In this talk I will introduce how to use keywords and public available data to build our structural KB, and build knowledge retrieval system for different languages using python.\n\nMany large-scale Knowledge Bases (KB), such as Yago, Wikidata, Freebase, and Google’s Knowledge Graph, have been build by extracting facts fro structural Wikipedia and/or natural language Web documents.\n\nThe main observation of using knowledge base is that not all facts are useful and have enough information. To tackle this problem I will introduce how we build various data sources to help facts and keywords selection. We will also discuss important questions of KB applications including, - architecture of a KB processing and extraction system using Wikipedia and two public available KB including Wikidata and Yago; - method for calculating contextual relevance between facts. - how to present different facts to users.\n\nYago: https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/research/yago-naga/yago/\nWikidata: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page\nFreebase: https://developers.google.com/freebase/\nGoogle’s Knowledge Graph: https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/"
