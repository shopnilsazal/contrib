description: "This talk will examine the promise, potential and pitfalls of functional programming (FP) - both as a potential alternative to and extension of more widely-used programming paradigms. Drawing on real-world industrial experience of the exclusive use of pure functional programming over the past 5 years, the talk will highlight the benefits but also the limitations of FP. Can all the benefits of FP be gained by extending a traditional language? From a pragmatic, industrial perspective does pure FP go too far? Does it go far enough?\n\n\n\n\n\nLiked the song? It's \"Tank\" by Seatbelts"
