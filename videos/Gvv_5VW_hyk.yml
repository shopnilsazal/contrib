description: "This talk was recorded at CukenFest London 2018\n\nhttp://cukenfest.cucumber.io/\n\nWhen BDD was originally created by Dan North, he took out the word \"test\" and replaced it with \"should\", enabling people to talk through examples of how systems behave more easily than talking through tests. But if BDD's not actually about testing, what is it about?\n\nIn this talk we look at the three aspects of BDD, and how to use them to have even more effective conversations, not only writing software that matters but finding out quickly when it doesn't."
