description: "Using Kubernetes Local Storage for Scale-Out Storage Services in Production - Michelle Au, Google & Ian Chakeres, Salesforce (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nCompanies and their customers continue to generate and store data with rapid growth. Kubernetes with local persistent storage enables high-performance workloads and scale-out storage software services to keep pace with demand both on-premise and in the cloud. We'll show how we leverage the Kubernetes local persistent storage feature to run multiple distributed storage services in production clusters. Topics discussed and demoed include node and local disk preparation, local PV provisioning with multiple storage classes, workload scaling, recovery, and future improvements.\n\n\"About Michelle\nMichelle Au is a software engineer at Google and is leading the local persistent storage project in Kubernetes. Prior to Google, she was at EMC, working on cluster management and cluster communication protocols. She received a BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from UC Berkeley.\n\nAbout Ian\nDr. Ian Chakeres enjoys building cloud software teams, products, and technology. At Salesforce, Ian is constructing software infrastructure optimized for scale-out stateful services at Salesforce using containers and Kubernetes orchestration. Ian holds an Executive MBA from the University of North Carolina KFBS, a PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of California Santa Barbara, a MS in Electrical Engineering from the Ohio State University, and a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Ohio State University.\"\n\nWant to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)."
