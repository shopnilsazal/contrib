description: "Believe it or not, software development does not happen on Stackoverflow. It does not even happen in the IDE of your choice. It’s all in your head. And in order to stay in the game and work on the exciting projects we have to learn new technologies and skills. It’s a critical part of our job, yet the most exciting one - we have to constantly learn.\n\nJoin me in this talk to learn not only about what the Open Source is and how you can contribute to it, but mainly how it can help you boosting your skills and career."
