title: 'Scotland Ruby 2011 - Refactoring a Legacy Java Application to Rails'
recordingDate: 1432058307
description: "by: Nick Sieger\n\nWhile JRuby makes all kinds of sense as integration glue for enterprise Java applications, introducing Rails into an existing application without doing any significant rewriting may not be obvious. We'll present and demonstrate several strategies for incrementally moving portions of the application to Ruby and taking advantage of the productivity of Rails in a legacy Java environment."
