description: "Steward, the Kubernetes-Native Service Broker [A] - Gabe Monroy, Deis\n\nNo application is an island. Most applications interact with a diverse set of services, not all of which run on a Kubernetes cluster. How do you manage access to both on and off cluster resources? Join Gabe Monroy, CTO of Deis, for a discussion about service catalogs, explicit service bindings, and how they can help you rationalize heterogeneous computing environments. We will end with a demo of Steward, an open source service broker for Kubernetes.\n\nAbout Gabe Monroy\nGabriel Monroy (@gabrtv) is the CTO and creator of Deis. As an early contributor to Docker and Kubernetes, Gabriel has deep experience with containers in production and frequently advises organizations on PaaS, distributed systems, and cloud-native architectures. Gabriel speaks regularly at industry events including KubeCon, Dockercon, CoreOS Fest, Tectonic Summit, and QCon."
