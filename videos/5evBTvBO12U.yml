The\ntalk will cover the hardware and modules, discuss briefly the\nalternatives, and finally show a live demo.\n\n-----\n\nThe robot uses two main modules:\n\n - **OpenCV** (_Open Source Computer Vision Library_), an open-source\nlibrary that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms.\nUsage ranges from interactive art, to mines inspection, stitching maps\non the web or through advanced robotics.\n\n - **gpiozero**, a simple interface to everyday GPIO components used\nwith Raspberry Pi.\n\nThe first is used to recognize the people and the object; the second\nto control the robot."
