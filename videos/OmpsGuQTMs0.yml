title: 'Rocky Mountain Ruby 2013 An ode to 17 databases in 29 minutes by Toby Hede'
recordingDate: 1381625575
description: "A detailed, deep-diving, in-the-deep-end and occasionally humorous whirlwind introduction and analysis of a suite of modern (and delightfully archaic) database technologies. How they work, why they work, and when you might want them to work. For no extra charge I will attempt to explain the oft-misunderstood CAP theorem, using databases as a device for understanding the trade offs and compromises inherent in building complex distributed systems.\n\nIncluding but not limited to:\n\nPostgreSQL Redis Cassandra Hyperdex MongoDb Riak\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG7M/"
