description: "Quit managing the infrastructure to manage your infratsructure OpsTheater, an open source stack of best of breed infrastructure management tools\nby Walter Heck\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nIf you need to manage more then a reasonably sized infrastructure in today'sday and age you will want to automate things as much as possible. In order todo that properly, you'll need to use tools that help you manage yourinfrastructure. This poses a problem: before you can manage yourinfrastructure, you now need to manage the infrastructure you will use tomanage your infrastructure. The interesting bit is that if you use industrybest practices, a lot of that management infra will look the same or similaracross organisations. So why do we need to reinvent the weel over and over?\n\nThis talk will present OpsTheater, a stack of tools used to manage aninfrastructure made up of current industry best practices (Puppet, GitLab,Icinga, ELK stack). OpsTheater is a fully open source project that was startedin late 2015 and is growing to be a great set of tools that takes away thework we do over and over: managing the infrastructure to manage ourinfrastructure. We will look at the problems OpsTheater solves, the state ofthe project and what you can do with it today. If you want to help, we'll showwhere you an go and what you can do. If time permits, a demo will be addedshowing some of the things we can do with OpsTheater.\n\n\nRoom: UA2.220 (Guillissen)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 13:00:00"
