description: "Slides and more info - http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2016/robert-virding\n\nWhy yet another lisp? Why do we need/want a new lisp for the Erlang VM? What is it that makes the existing ones, even Clojure, a bad fit? LFE (Lisp Flavoured Erlang) has been designed to run efficiently on the Erlang VM and at the same time be a \"real lisp\" providing Lisp's good bits. We will describe the language and how it uses the properties of the system as well as some of the tooling around it."
