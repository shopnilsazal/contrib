description: "Extending Kubernetes 101 [A] - Travis Nielsen, Quantum Corp\n\nKubernetes provides the ability to extend the platform with your own custom types and controllers. We will walk through a tutorial to write a custom controller, also known as an operator. Patterns will be reviewed that will make your application a natural extension of the platform through CRDs and desired state management, all with the same security, lifecycle management, and API surface that native Kubernetes applications expect.\n\nAbout Travis Nielsen\nTravis Nielsen is a Principal Software Engineer for Quantum Corporation where he works on Rook â€“ a software defined storage initiative based in Seattle. Prior to Quantum, Travis was the storage platform tech lead at Symform, a P2P storage startup acquired by Quantum. Before joining the startup world, he was an engineering lead for the Windows Server group at Microsoft."
