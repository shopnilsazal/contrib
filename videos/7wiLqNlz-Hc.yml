description: "The Journey to Cloud Native - A Case Study with Mantl.io\n\nDevelopers are driving the market for cloud consumption and leading each industry into the new era of software defined disruption. There are no longer questions about elastic and flexible agile development as the way to innovate and reduce time to market for businesses. However, Physical and cloud Infrastructure does not enable application development platforms natively nor provide the ability to create applications that are cloud native with elastic services. In addition, businesses are moving to application development architectures leveraging cloud native technologies which are becoming more strategic to their business strategy. This presentation will look at the journey that developers take to transform to an application centric development model leveraging cloud native technologies. \n\nThis presentation will clearly define what a enterprises and services providers are deploying into production and how it enables elastic, flexible, and portable application workload deployment. The presentation will take a look at two production deployments and discuss the lessons learned and how to apply them to your cloud native journey."
