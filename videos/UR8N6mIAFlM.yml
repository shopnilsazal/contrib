description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nAre You Ready to Be Edgy? — Bringing Cloud-Native Applications to the Edge of the Network - Megan O'Keefe & Steve Louie, Cisco (Advanced Skill Level)\n\nMore devices means more data, more applications, and more pressure on the cloud to transport, process, and store massive amounts of data. Edge computing aims to mitigate this network bottleneck by offloading intensive compute and storage to many \"microdatacenters\" at the edge of the network. In this talk, Megan and Steve explore the state of edge computing and its benefits to users in the areas of lower latency, data privacy, and safety. They outline exciting use cases for edge, including machine learning, virtual/mixed reality, video, transportation, and natural disaster detection. Then, they discuss what makes an application \"edge-ready,\" from storage and network requirements to multitenancy and security. Finally, they demonstrate, using a prototype edge management platform built on top of Kubernetes, the process of deploying an edge application to multiple microdatacenters at once.\n\nNote: This demo and our team’s prototypes in Edge Computing are not part of any official Cisco products.\n\nAbout Megan\nMegan is a software engineer at Cisco, where she works on a team dedicated to innovation in cloud, video, and data center technologies. Megan has spent the last year immersed in edge computing, where she has worked with service providers to help prototype a new platform for cloud-native edge applications. In her spare time, Megan likes to experiment with Kubernetes and Golang, and loves to talk about all things edge and IoT.\n\nAbout Steve\nSteve Louie is a Software Engineer at Cisco responsible for developing distributed systems, focusing on bringing cloud-native methodologies to Cisco. Steve is a Kubernetes contributor, and wants to build a more elegant cloud. Steve holds a Masters degree in Computer Science from Lehigh University and specialized in entrepreneurship as an undergrad. When he's not writing Go code, he can be found Swing Dancing in Boston's Lindy Hop community."
