description: "The Frankenstein Framework - The Polyglot future of the web by Merrick Christensen\n\nThe web as a platform has historically made sharing code very difficult. However, thanks to ES6 modules this is a problem of the past allowing us to combine toolsets in ways we never could before. What happens when you take Backbone’s Models, Angular 2’s DI, React, maybe even some Ember Router then leverage them together in a project? The Frankenstein Framework. The time of “choosing a framework” is dead, compose your own frameworks today thanks to the power of ES6. (Webpack until ES6 is around for reals.)\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GWi5/"
