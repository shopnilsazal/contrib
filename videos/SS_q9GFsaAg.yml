description: 'My talk will cover four ranking and clustering projects that I consulted on this past year. The projects range from ranking Olympic athletes, mixed martial arts fighters, and cell phone carriers to clustering sentences to rank individuals by how much humility they evidence in their written language. For each project, I will address the particular data challenges and the solutions and techniques we proposed.'
