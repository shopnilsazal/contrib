description: "Microservices are all the rage, and so are security breaches! Learn what you can do to create one without the other.\n\nMicroservices give us many options. We can pick different technologies, mix synchronous and asynchronous integration techniques or embrace different deployment patterns. But they also give us different options for how we think about securing our systems. Done right, and microservices can increase the security of your vital data and processes. Done wrong, and you can increase the surface area of attack. This talk will discuss the importance of defence in depth, discussing the many different ways in which you can secure your fine-grained, distributed architectures.\n\nAudience: Developers, architects, technical leaders, operations engineers and anybody interested in the design and architecture of services and components.\n\nWhat You Will Learn: The audience should come away with a working framework for thinking about AppSec, and also understand how microservices can help (or hinder) building a secure system."
