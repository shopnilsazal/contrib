recordingDate: 1474648278
description: "PyData Chicago 2016\n\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/secret/cxZTghInOlIeOs\n\npomegranate is a python module for probabilistic modelling focusing on both ease of use and speed, beating out competitors, including scikit-learn, in benchmarks. In this talk I will describe how to use pomegranate to simply create sophisticated hidden Markov models, Bayesian Networks, General Mixture Models (and more!) and benchmark their implementations to other python packages."
