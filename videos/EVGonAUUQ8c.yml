description: "This 2016 GDC Europe talk, presented by IGDA executive director Kate Edwards, draws on her 20+ years of experience as a cartographer and game advisor to explain the primary factors game developers should consider in order to make their worlds seem more real, more relevant, and potentially free of inappropriate cultural cues.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
