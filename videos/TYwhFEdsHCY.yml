description: "Aaron Heady, Microsoft\n\nTraffic routing and failover strategies grow with the complexity of your service offering, and sometimes seemingly simple design choices of your services can dramatically impact what routing strategies you can use. Are all of your datacenters 100% identical, all data/services available everywhere? Do you have anything that requires affinity to a DC between multiple calls? What’s the experience for an end user when you do shift traffic? Do you have a client app on the user’s computer/phone that you can leverage to assist routing decisions or hide failovers? Or is the F5 key in the browser going to be how users recover? This really isn’t a conversation that can be thorough with just 50 minutes, but we can hopefully give you insight into what you need to be thinking about by sharing some of the things we’ve learned running Bing.com for a while."
