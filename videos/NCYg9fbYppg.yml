description: "Jonathan Wignall - Network Worms, What Is Possible\nNetwork Worms, What Is Possible\n\nNetwork worms have been around for almost as long as the computer networks they need to spread via, but it only with the advent of mass internet access that they have become commonplace. This presentation will outline what network worms are, and how they differ from a 'normal' computer virus. but in the main concentrate on what future worms could achieve.\n\nThe presentation will look forward to what we could see in both the near, and far future giving examples of what can be developed. Web replication and other possible distribution methods will be discussed and you will learn why so few worms currently effectively achieve mass distribution.\n\nNo prior technical knowledge is required of the audience, and should be understandable by those with limited knowledge of computers, although greater knowledge will be a plus.\n\nJonathan Wignall is the Chair of the Data and Network Security Council a UK not for profit information security campaign group, calling for improved online security/privacy protection. He also is an experienced college lecturer with research intrests in self replicating code and network dependency attacks."
