description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Marc Poppleton, Orange Labs.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-27\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/marcpoppleton/android-all-the-things\n\nWant to build your own DIY smart house stuff but cannot handle a soldering iron without turning everything into a smoldering pile of ash?\nI've got you covered! All you need is a Raspberry Pi, a bunch of off-the-shelf sensors and some Kotlin code (and a bit of Javascript). I'll show you how I made my smart house system using Android Things, Firebase, an Android App and Actions for Google without setting anything on fire unintentionally.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
