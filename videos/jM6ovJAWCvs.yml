description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nStretching the Mesh - John Joyce & Robert Li, Cisco Systems (Any Skill Level)\n\nMultiple clouds are a must in todayâ€™s IT world to prevent vendor lock-in, provide redundancy, a migration path, and other benefits. Developer's and IT admins demand that applications, and the micro-services that comprise them, be capable of running in multiple environments. A service mesh, instantiated by Istio, provides a new paradigm for connecting, managing and securing microservices. With services running in multiple clouds, the service mesh has to be established across clouds. In this presentation, John and Robert will show how an application can be stretched between two disparate cloud environments--public cloud and on-prem private cloud. The demonstration will show how the service mesh is stretched to fully enable service mesh features for all services and endpoints in both cloud environments. The summary will discuss how the Istio community has addressed this problem.\n\nAbout Robert\nRobert is a technical lead engineer at Cisco. For the past several years, I have been contributing to cloud infrastructure software development, especially in OpenStack. My current focus is to contributing to the Kubernetes & Istio communities.\n\nAbout John\nJohn is a principal engineer at Cisco responsible for developing cloud infrastructure and solutions. As part of the Cloud CTO Office, John currently focuses on contributing to the Kubernetes & Istio communities. Previously, John was an active contributor to OpenStack.
