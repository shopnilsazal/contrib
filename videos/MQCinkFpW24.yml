description: "Black Ops\nDan Kaminsky Chief Scientist, DKH\n\nIf there's one thing we know, it's that we're doing it wrong. Sacred cows make the best hamburgers, so in this year's talk I'm going to play with some techniques that are obviously wrong and evil and naive. There will also be a lot of very interesting code, spanning the range from high speed network stacks to random number engines to a much deeper analysis of non-neutral networks. Finally, we will revisit DNSSEC, both in code, and in what it can mean to change the battleground in your favor.\n\nDan Kaminsky: I play with toys\nhttp://dankaminsky.com\nTwitter: @dakami"
