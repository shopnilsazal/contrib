description: "\"Teaching Privacy Using Red Team Strategies: An Undergraduate General Education Curriculum\" \nRobert Olson (nerdprof)\n\nPrivacy is very important concept that, unfortunately, many undergraduate students don’t encounter frequently in their chosen courses of study. Often, when it is discussed, it’s discussed using a deeply philosophical approach to which students may have a difficult time connecting. This approach also often fails to connect privacy with many of the important technical nuances that can have a significant impact on modern privacy debates.\n\nThis talk will discuss an alternative approach used in a Spring 2015 undergraduate general education course titled Hacking, Surveillance, and Privacy. The goal of this class was to take a technical approach to teaching privacy concepts in order to ensure students would understand the technical details of modern privacy debates in an addition to the philosophical concepts.\n\nStudents were given hands-on experiences with penetration testing tools so that they might better understand how computer security impacts privacy while seeing first-hand how their privacy might be violated. Students were exposed to data-mining techniques so that they might understand the privacy implications of large-scale data collection. Finally, students were exposed to privacy tools so that they might understand the challenges in protecting one’s privacy against modern threats.\n\nRobert Olson is currently an instructor in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the State University of New York at Fredonia, where he teaches courses in security, data mining, and programming. He holds two graduate degrees in Interdisciplinary Studies (Cognitive Science) and Management Information Systems as well as several professional certifications. He has spoken at the Def Con 22 Crypto / Privacy Village, BSides Rochester, and several academic conferences. Most recently, his research has been focused on designing penetration testing agents and exploring new ideas in privacy protecting network protocols."
