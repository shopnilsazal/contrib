description: "Every group of people ends up with values that guide their work, whether they mean to or not. Be deliberate in choosing the values that matter to your team, put them into action, and communicate them to the people around you. Our team figured out our core values and we actually use them in making day-to-day decisions. Communicating them helped us launch a website redesign with minimal freakout. I'll share things to consider when figuring out your team's values, and how to use them in practice.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HCPP/"
