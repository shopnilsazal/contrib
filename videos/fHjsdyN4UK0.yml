description: "How I fixed UNIX atime! With 10 lines of code and feminism!!! By Valerie Aurora\n\nFile systems are way too hard for ordinary people to understand, right? No way!!! I'll explain how I saved billions of unnecessary disk writes by fixing one of the oldest file system problems in existence --- UNIX file access time updates! I'll explain it in terms even a computer beginner can understand! And I'll show how feminism helped me do it!!!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/KYiG/"
