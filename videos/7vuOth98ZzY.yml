description: "The Seven Righteous Fights by Heidi Waterhouse\n\nThere are seven fights that I have over and over again, whenever I start at a company. I'm here to convince you that it's valuable for everyone to have these things in mind from the inception of a project.\n\nHaving these fights early prevents you from doing the software equivalent of poking chocolate chips into an already-baked cookie"
