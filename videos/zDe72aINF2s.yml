description: 'A Role for Topology in Data Science: The mathematical discipline of topology offers a new approach to data analysis that is especially important in todayâ€™s world of complex, high-dimensional, noisy data. Topological methods extend and enhance traditional machine learning techniques to enable more nuanced data exploration, more refined segmentation, and more effective modeling. This talk will describe a topological method for detecting the underlying shape of any dataset, then give examples applying this technique in practice.'
