description: "I didn't know squat about C or building extensions in Ruby. But I did want a Ruby-controlled Lego Mindstorms robot to get kids excited about Ruby. We'll dive into the basics of building C extensions, build a Ruby DSL to teach kids to drive cool Lego robots, and show off the amazing things you can do when you pull up Ruby's floorboards and look at the actually-not-too-scary C code underneath.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FixF/"
