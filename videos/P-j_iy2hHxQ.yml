description: "The web development community has seen a rise in new web frameworks that provide small to large organizations with the opportunity to decrease development time and increase productivity. Frameworks such as Play! and Node.js as well as their supporting API(s) allow development staff to quickly and efficiently create and ship a product. But with these new frameworks come the same security issues that have plagued the web for years.\n\nThis talk will show how frameworks such as Spring and Django have solved these issues in the past, gaps in the newer frameworks, and provide code examples as well as offer helpful solutions to address these concerns within the frameworks discussed during this talk.\n  \n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
