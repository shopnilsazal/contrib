description: "Zack Fasel Urbane Security\n\nYes. \"The Cloud\" (drink). Even though many of us would much like to see use of public clouds decline, they're not going away any time soon. And with such, a plethora of companies now have revolutionary new solutions to solve your \"cloud problems\". From crypto to single sign on with two step auth, proxies to monitoring and DLP, every vendor has a solution, even cloud based for the cloud!\n\nWhat we haven't seen is much of an open source or community lead solution to these problems. So let's change that.\n\nZack will review the laundry list of security problems with various cloud providers (and their pluthera of APIs), provide some easy fixes to the common issues seen, and introduce a few new open source tools to help monitor and defend the data and access in the wild.\n\nZack Fasel is a Founding Partner at Urbane Security, a solutions-focused vendor-agnostic information security services firm focusing on providing innovative defense, sophisticated offense and refined compliance services. Heading up Urbane's Research and Security Services divisions, Zack brings his years of diverse internal and external experience to drive Urbane's technical solutions to organizations top pain points. His previous research and presentations at conferences have spread across numerous domains including Windows authentication flaws, femtocells, open source defensive security solutions and unique network and application attack vectors. When not selling out, he can be found lost in the untz unce wubs, dabbling in instagram food photography, or eating scotch and drinking gummy bears (that's right, right?). More information on him can be found at zfasel.com and on Urbane Security at UrbaneSecurity.com.\nTwitter: @zfasel"
