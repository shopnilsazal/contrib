description: "Copy of the slides for this talk are here: https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Cui/DEFCON-20-Cui-FRAK.pdf \n\nEmbedded Device Firmware Vulnerability Hunting Using FRAK, the Firmware Reverse Analysis Konsole\nAng Cui Red Balloon Security\n\nWe present FRAK, the firmware reverse analysis konsole. FRAK is a framework for unpacking, analyzing, modifying and repacking the firmware images of proprietary embedded devices. The FRAK framework provides a programmatic environment for the analysis of arbitrary embedded device firmware as well as an interactive environment for the disassembly, manipulation and re-assembly of such binary images.\n\nWe demonstrate the automated analysis of Cisco IOS, Cisco IP phone and HP LaserJet printer firmware images. We show how FRAK can integrate with existing vulnerability analysis tools to automate bug hunting for embedded devices. We also demonstrate how FRAK can be used to inject experimental host-based defenses into proprietary devices like Cisco routers and HP printers.\n\nAng Cui is the founder of Red Ballon Security Inc., which specializes in the development of offensive and defensive technologies for embedded systems. Ang is also currently a PhD candidate at Columbia University in the Intrusion Detection Systems Laboratory."
