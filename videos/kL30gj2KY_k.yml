title: 'Cloudlets: universal server images for the cloud'
recordingDate: 1266145397
description: "by Solomon Hykes \r\n\r\nIn this talk we will discuss the issue of server images, and how it affects inter-cloud portability. We will describe our vision for a universal format which can be shared and improved as easily as a Git repository, and how we're implementing it with cloudlets. \r\n\r\nCloudlets are universal server images for the cloud. They're lightweight, version-controlled, and you can export them to any bootable format known to man: Xen, KVM, Amazon EC2, or just a plain bootable CD. They can be shared and distributed with the semantics of tools such as Git and Mercurial. \r\n\r\nOur goal is to build the foundations for truly cloud-independent infrastructures. Our roadmap includes: \r\n\r\n* Multi-image stacks * Auto-scaling * Automated integration tests * In-place image editing * Integration with existing VM generation and configuration management tools \r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nâ—¦http://bitbucket.org/dotcloud/cloudlets \r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
