The internals of this type of devices (Architecture, PCB components, ENEA RTOS details) \n2. How to dump the Flash Memory \n3. Firmware update to bypass security checks and get access to restricted configuration\n4. How to Backdoor the pump by gaining code execution \n    a. Inside into the pump: Processes running, configuration files, etc. \n5. DEMO on stage! \n6. Takeaways: Recommendations to prevent these attacks from happening again"
