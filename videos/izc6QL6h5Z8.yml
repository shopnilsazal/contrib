description: "How can we make Ruby programming more pleasant? The most common (and easiest) methods are to make RubyGems or fix Rails defects. How about contributing to Ruby? Most people think that it's difficult to contribute or fix Ruby. Well, it is actually easy to contribute to or fix Ruby and many more people would be affected by your effort!\n\nHow can you start fixing Ruby? I'll introduce the methods to get started in improving Ruby, such as proposals of new features, writing documents, fixing websites, reporting defects and more.\n\nFurthermore, there are techniques to help get your proposals accepted, and I'll talk about those too. You can improve the world by contributing to Ruby.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGZG/"
