The goal of the WorldWide WarDrive (or WWWD) is to provide a statistical analysis of the many access points that are currently deployed.\n\nRoamer will discuss the origin of the project, many of the difficulties the project has run into with the press and \"other entities\", the truth behind the goals of the project and the direction the project is moving in the future. Also, the full statistical analysis and results of the Third WorldWide WarDrive will be revealed for the first time.\n\nChris Hurley (aka Roamer) is a Principal Information Security Engineer working in the Washington DC area. Primarily focusing his efforts on vulnerability assessments, he also performs penetration testing, forensics and incident response operations on both wired and wireless networks. He has spoken at several security conferences, been published in numerous online and print publications, and been the subject of several interviews and stories regarding the WorldWide WarDrive. He has worked as a DefCon Goon for the past four years and is the primary organizer of the DefCon WarDriving Contest."
