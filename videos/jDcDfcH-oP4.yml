Or 8 million visits in just 4/10 of a second?\r\n\r\nUser expectations are higher than ever when it comes to web performance, so much so that we've created an entirely new application architecture just to make it feel like our websites are faster than they actually are.\r\n\r\nThis talk will look at how we can improve our users experience at any scale through performance optimizations at every layer of the stack, from backend to browser."
