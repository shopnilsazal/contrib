Mutation testing will help you:\n\nWrite better tests\nProduce more robust code that better handles edge cases\nReveal what parts of your legacy application are most likely to break before you dive in to make new changes\nLearn about features in Ruby and your dependencies that you didnâ€™t previously know about\nThis talk assumes a basic knowledge of Ruby and testing. The examples in this talk will almost certainly teach you something new about Ruby!"
