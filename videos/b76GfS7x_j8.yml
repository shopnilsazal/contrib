title: 'Rails Conf 2013 Keeping the lights on: Application monitoring with Sensu and BatsD'
recordingDate: 1369413322
description: "By Aaron Pfeifer\n\nThe good news: you're quickly signing up new customers, you've scaled your Rails app to a growing cluster of 10+ servers, and the business is really starting to take off. Great! The bad news: Just 30m of failures is starting to be measured in hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Who's going to make sure the lights stay on when your app is starting to fall over? Or worse, what if your app is up, but sign-ups, payments, or some other critical function is broken? \n\nLearn how you can build a robust monitoring infrastructure using the Sensu platform: track business metrics in all of your applications, any system metric on your servers, and do so all with the help of BatsD - a time series data store for real-time needs. We'll also talk about how to look at trending data and how you can integrate Sensu against PagerDuty, RabbitMQ, or any other third-party service. Oh, and of course - everything's written in Ruby, so you can even use your favorite gems!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGaK/"
