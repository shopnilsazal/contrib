How about trying it for real? Now that we've got the kinect, lets hook it up to some hacking tools and see what it looks like to hack via kinect!\n\nJeff Bryner has 20 years of experience integrating systems, fixing security issues, performing incident response and forensics. He writes for the SANS forensic blog, has spoken at RSA on SCADA security issues, DEFCON 18 on the google toolbar and runs p0wnlabs.com just for fun.\nTwitter: @p0wnlabs"
