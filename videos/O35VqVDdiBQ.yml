description: "Simulation of MITM in PEAP with hostap application of EAP state machines from hostap for MITM simulation\nby Siarhei Siniak\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nIt's a talk about MITM in Tunneled Authentication Protocols and its consequentimplementation with a help of hostap project. The research is not original andyou may find a deeper overview in the paper: Pieter Robyns, Bram Bonné, PeterQuax, Wim Lamotte, Exploiting WPA2-enterprise vendor implementation weaknessesthrough challenge response oracles, July 2014.\n\nThere is a lot of information about hijacking internet connection. The mosttrivial case is unencrypted (open) wireless connection. But it is stillpossible if the network is protected with WPA/WPA2-Enteprise.\n\nThree days work was sufficient to modify the behaviour of MSCHAPv2 and a bitof PEAP methods in EAP state machine within hostap. In the end, proof-of-concept simulation demonstrates the attack flow.\n\nIt is reasonable, since this code base is widely spread and up-to-date, what'seven more important. Hence, it is a very good sandbox for EAP attacks.\n\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 11:00:00"
