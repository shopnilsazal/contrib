description: "In this workshop we'll learn how to transform complex, highly coupled code into a simpler, more readable and maintainable shape. We'll target known software anomalies with Refactoring Patternsâ€Ž, following steps with a confined scope, assuring that we stay distant from \"changed everything\" commits while achieving quick design improvements.\n\nWe'll talk different solutions for Fat Models, God Objects, long method chains, NoMethodError on nils, long methods, bad naming and cold coffee.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0U/"
