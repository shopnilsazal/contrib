title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2016 Tony Morris - The Expression Problem and Lenses'
recordingDate: 1466828242
description: "The Expression Problem (TEP), a new name by Phil Wadler for an old problem, has presented challenges to programmers for decades. The practical considerations are particularly pertinent in safe, purely-functional programming where accurate representations of software models are a primary goal.\n\nProposed approaches to TEP have consistently fell short of a reasonable solution.\n\nIn this talk, I will use the Haskell lens library to propose a resolution to TEP that achieves all the desired benefits, with minimal penalty. I will first describe The Expression Problem, the principles of the lens library, then demonstrate a principled resolution to TEP.\n\nTony Morris is a software product developer who has deployed functional programming techniques in industry for over 10 years. Tony teaches at the tertiary level and for professional programmers with a view toward producing a viable commercial result. Tony is currently a Senior Software Engineer at NICTA where he is tasked with promoting and educating on functional programming for the benefit of all Australian software developers.\n\nTony takes a fastidious, principled approach to functional programming both when deployed in practice and when in a learning environment to ensure maximum yield from the effort. Tony believes that exploring principles and the following consequences provides a rewarding experience for all involved.\n\nFor more on YOW! Lambda Jam, visit http://lambdajam.yowconference.com.au"
