description: "Hot Swapping Our Rails Front End In Secret - A Rebrand Story by Chris LoPresto\n\n“Everything looks like this, but we want it to look like that.” This is the story of how the team at Betterment replaced our front end code base to launch our new brand. Across all our apps. In secret. And make everything responsive. In 8 weeks.\n\nRails conventions come in handy when a wholesale UI transformation is called for. Learn how we launched a design system, dark deployed an all-new view layer, and unveiled our new brand identity right on schedule.\n\nWe shipped a lot of code extremely quickly yet managed to elevate code quality and capabilities in the process.\n\nConstraint breeds creativity."
