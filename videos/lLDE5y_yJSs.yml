description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup: Victor Makarenkov | Easy Spark: Exploiting large datasets for multi-class classification\n\nPyData Tel Aviv Meetup #3\n5 April 2017\nSponsored and hosted by Taboola\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nApache Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. At first glance, it seems that getting started with programming the Hadoop eco-system is quite cumbersome, and not so user-friendly for a data scientist or a machine learning specialist. In this talk I will briefly introduce Apache Spark, and its programming paradigm. I will show how to easily execute a distributed training of the common multi-class classifiers (na√Øve Bayes, random forest, logistic regression), without installing a single virtual machine, virtual box or a docker. I will share my experience of managing long-term software projects which are based on the Hadoop technology for data storage, extraction and transformation.\nCode: https://github.com/vicmak/Mining-Massive-Datasets\n\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData brings together both users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The goals are to provide data science enthusiasts, across various domains, a place to discuss how best to apply languages and tools to the challenges of data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.\n\nPyData is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) charity in the United States. www.numfocus.org"
