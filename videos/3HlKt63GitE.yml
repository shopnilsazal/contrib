recordingDate: 1347664369
description: "Everyone acknowledges that the software field has an issue with gender balance, but there are many of arguments about what to do about it. Recent events have caused the community to scrutinize how they treat the issues of race and gender. The social justice community uses the term 'anti-oppression' to describe techniques for being more inclusive to people of a wide variety of backgrounds, ethnicities, sexualities, and genders. Software developers generally lack exposure to these terms and techniques.\n\nIn this talk, Lindsey and Steve will introduce basic anti-oppression concepts, and provide specific examples of situations where we as software developers can use these tools to engender a more inclusive community."
