title: 'Bringing Tasks to NETMF via a Batmobile - (or a Batmobile code off) - Captain Obvious'

description: "Captain Obvious\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/dotnetfringe/sdkwfd/\n&quot;I would like to discuss the fully managed code, TLP inspired, Task API that I created for the Micro Framework (and net1.0). How having a task oriented API helps improve the portability of developers to NETMF. What&#39;s next, now that we have a Task API, maybe its time to think about a uOWIN?\nThis code is in a private repo on GitHub, and I will allow a Reader access for verification of existence. I am in the middle of a structural cleanup as I implement full build automation (including my xunit inspired test framework) and Nuget delivery. Once this structural change is complete, I will cleanup the history and open access.\nI recently put this code into production with an Outlaw Pinewood Derby car. It smashed into a wall 50 feet away about 10 feet high after running the track backwards. It survived mostly intact, and has since been rebuilt. I&#39;m willing to run it just about anywhere, and video it.\nI see the possibility of adding an I2C/SPI Accelerometer, and having an open code contest to use the platform in a unique way - such as logging, motion based motor start: pull back to wind up, and others.&quot;"
