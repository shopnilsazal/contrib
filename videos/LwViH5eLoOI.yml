description: "Lightning Talk - K8s Port: Cultivate an Engaged Community of Kubernetes Advocates through Gamification and Rewards - Ryan Quackenbush, Apprenda\n\nRecognizing the contributions made to the Kubernetes community has never been easier. By directly engaging them through a simple, gamified, performance-based system and by implementing an integration with GitHub, we’re highlighting work that’s being done amongst the members automatically.\n\nAbout Ryan Quackenbush\nRyan Quackenbush is Apprenda's resident Advocacy genius. After successfully building and driving Apprenda's internal social media and community amplification hub, he created the Kubernetes Portal to reward the people that have made Kubernetes into the defacto standard of container orchestration. When not impersonating Ted Theodore Logan, he lives in the Capital region of New York rooting for the Mets with his wife."
