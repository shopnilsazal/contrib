description: "Speaker : Patrick Chanezon (Docker)\n\nDocker moves very fast, with an edge channel released every month and a stable release every 3 months. This talk is right after DockerCon EU. Patrick will talk about what's new in Docker 17.09, which should have shipped in September, a recap of DockerCon EU announcements, and an update on the OCI standards and the Moby project, which is the upstream project from which Docker is built."
