description: "by Felix Salfelder\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nGnucap, the GNU circuit analysis package, is a flexible mixed-signal circuitsimulator with significant technical advantages over SPICE derivatives. One ismodularity. Gnucap implements a dynamic loader for extesions adding languagesupport or component models.\n\nRecently, some of the extensions for an experimental fork have been adapted tothe the main line. An overview over the development progress and availablefunctionality will be provided. This talk will demonstrate the use of gedaschematics and verilog device models in Gnucap driven circuit simulations.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 08:00:00"
