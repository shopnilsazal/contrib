description: 'Common Problems In Hyperparameter Optimization: All large machine learning pipelines have tunable parameters, commonly referred to as hyperparameters. Hyperparameter optimization is the process by which we find the values for these parameters that cause our system to perform the best. SigOpt provides a Bayesian optimization platform that is commonly used for hyperparameter optimization, and I’m going to share some of the common problems we’ve seen when integrating into machine learning pipelines.'
