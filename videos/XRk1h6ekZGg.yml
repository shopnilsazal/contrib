description: 'MacRuby is an implementation of Ruby 1.9 that is directly on top of Mac OS X core technologies. Recently, MacRuby has become viable as a tool for developing useful desktop applications for Mac OS X. However, as of March 2011, MacRuby is still missing some functionality that is present in cRuby. Therefore, MacRuby is not able to run Ruby on Rails. In my presentation, I will explain how I modified MacRuby to make it a suitable foundation for running Rails. I would also like to explain some of technical intricacies that I discovered along the way.'
