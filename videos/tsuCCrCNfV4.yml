description: "Adapting Brownfield Deployments to Cloud-Native Technology - Richard Hartmann\n\nWhile most people will hopefully agree that a modern greenfield deployment should be based on cloud-native technology, there's a huge installed base of brownfield installations which are hard to impossible to simply switch out over night. This talk is about lessons learned in a company offering everything from carrier and ISP services, over hosting and housing, to architecture and operations, and even web development migrating from a myriad of legacy monitoring systems to One Global Source of Truth: Prometheus. It will also cover technical problems, social challenges, unexpected surprises, and the sheer, distilled joy of removing pager fatigue."
