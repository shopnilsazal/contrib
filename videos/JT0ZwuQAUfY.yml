description: "by Sveta Smirnova and Alexander Rubin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nApache Spark is a cluster computing framework, similar to Apache Hadoop. Thereare a number of tasks where MySQL does not show great performance: for exampleMySQL is not massively parallel system and a single query will only utilize 1CPU core . Spark, on the the other hand is designed to be massively parallel;in addition Spark is a clustering framework, so you can easily add morecompute nodes so that Spark can utilize more resources and scale.\n\nApache Drill is similar project aimed to make data discovery easier. Forexample it allow you to join data sources in MySQL, MongoDB, flat files, otherRDBMS, etc.\n\nIn this talk I will demonstrate how to use Apache Spark together with MySQLfor data analysis. I will sho how Apache Spark aggregates data (wikipediapageview statistics) and stores the resultset in MySQL. I will also show howto use Apache Spark with multiple sources and join virtual tables from MySQL,flat files and even MongoDB.\n\n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 15:05:00"
