description: "\"Music is a world within itself, with a language we all understand\" said Stevie Wonder. That sounds a lot like programming! The parallels between music and software development are striking, and understanding how they intersect can teach us a lot about how we can improve our code, our craft, and our joy in how we approach our work. In this talk, which will include some *unique musical forms of live audience participation*, we will experience some of the patterns that connect two of the most human of activities: creating code, and creating music.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GXlW/"
