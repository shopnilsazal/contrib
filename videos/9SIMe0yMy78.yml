description: "From day one when you buy a piece of wireless technology, whether it be just a cell phone, laptop or a fitbit, you get a wireless signature. In this talk we will talk about some of the things that can identify you in an environment and how people can track you. We will look at bluetooth scanning apps that you can use every day to track people inconspicuously from your phone, while walking, metroing, or as a passenger in a car driving. (Note: Some of this will require additional hardware, but we will show how you would do this via a laptop if you can't/don't want to buy additional hardware)\n\nI will also be sharing how I was able to identify certain individuals who where around me was around me while traveling.\n\nThere will be a demo and walk anyone that is interested how they can do the same on their laptop right away. Depending on the setup of the room this year, this may mean one on one walking around or having individuals following along and field questions from the front of the room when experiencing problems.\n\nIndividuals that attend this presentation should be able to:\n\nUse their Android or iPhone to identify bluetooth in their environment\nUse Kismet (Android or Laptop) to identify users via wifi connections\n\nSpeaker Bio: \nJoshua currently works doing Incident Response in the Washington DC Area where he is part of the security group NovaHackers.
