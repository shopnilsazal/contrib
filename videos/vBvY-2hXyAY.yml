description: "Scott Fullam, Introduction to Hardware Hacking\nInterested in hardware hacking but were not sure where to start? This presentation is for you. I will show you how to get started with modifying equipment for fun and useful purposes. I will show you the best ways for opening the enclosures for electronic equipment without destroying it, how to identify electronic components, how to solder together circuits, where to get parts, and will do a walk through of several hacks i have completed. the talk is intended for beginners, but all experience levels will get a kick out of it.\n\nScott Fullam is the author of the O\"Reilly book \"Hardware Hacking Projects for Geeks\" published in February 2004.\n\nScott Fullam has been hacking hardware since he was 10 years old with his first RadioShack 100-in-1 electronic kit. He built an intruder alarm to keep his sister out of his room. Scott attended MIT earning Bachelors and Masters degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. While and undergraduate he built a shower detection system so that he could see if the community shower was in use to allow him to sleep in a few extra minutes in the morning if it was occupied. After graduating from MIT Scott designed children's toys and built close to 50 prototypes in 2 years. He then went to work at Apple Computer in the Advanced Technology Group designing digital still cameras. In 1995, Fullam co-founded PocketScience, which develops revolutionary mobile e-mail communications products and services. As the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Fullam personally developed all of the algorithms for the company's products. He also led the team that developed PocketScience's products and reference hardware. Scott now works as an independent consultant assisting consumer electronic companies design high quality products and manufacture them in the Far East. Scott holds 15 US patents. Never satisfied with how the consumer electronics products he own work, he often takes them apart and enhances their capabilities."
