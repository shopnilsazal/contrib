description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2017 by Chuck Greb, Mapzen.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-34\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/ecgreb/testable-android-architecture-android-makers-france\n\nToday we have many testing tools for Android including JUnit, Mockito, PowerMock, Robolectric, Espresso, and more. But how can you design your application to leverage each one most effectively? This talk introduces a modified version of the Model View Presenter (MVP) architecture that organizes your code to be more flexible, maintainable, and testable.\n\nUsing classic software design principles and modern code examples we will explore the topics of clean architecture and testability on Android. This talk covers all levels of the test pyramid including unit, integration, and UI tests. Other topics will include unit test rules, naming conventions, presenter lifecycle, persisting state, testing concurrency, mocking strategies, and working with legacy code.\n\nType: Android development\nExperience: expert\n\n Alex Karp Production"
