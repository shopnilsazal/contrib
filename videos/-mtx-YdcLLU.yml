This movement towards the elimination of cash has been picking up speed and mostly accepted by the populace as a huge convenience. We examine some reasons why this isn't such a good thing. We also look at legislation and laws in this area that give banks and the government unprecedented ability to track your financial transactions, cash and non with little or no cause. And finally some ways to avoid this scrutiny and protect your financial privacy.\n\nTony Howlett is President of Network Security Services, Inc.
