title: 'Dr Jessica Stauth: Portfolio and Risk Analytics in Python with pyfolio'
recordingDate: 1449251043
description: "PyData NYC 2015\n\nPyfolio is a recent open source library developed by Quantopian to support common financial analyses and plots of portfolio allocations over time. Pyfolio is a tear sheet that consists of various individual plots that provide a comprehensive image of the performance of a trading algorithm and features advanced statistical analyses using Bayesian modeling. (http://quantopian.github.io/pyfolio/).\n\nPython is quickly establishing itself as the lingua franca for quantitative finance. The rich stack of open source tools like Pandas, the Jupyter notebook, and Seaborn, provide quants with a rich and powerful tool belt to analyze financial data. While useful for Quantitative Finance, these general purpose libraries lack support for common financial analyses like the computation of certain risk factors (Sharpe, Fama-French), or plots of portfolio allocations over time.\n\nPyfolio is a recent open source tool developed by Quantopian to fill this gap. At the core of pyfolio is a so-called tear sheet that consists of various individual plots that provide a comprehensive image of the performance of a trading algorithm/portfolio. In addition, the library features advanced statistical analyses using Bayesian modeling. The software can be used stand-alone, w**ith our open-source backtesting library Zipline and is available on the Quantopian platform.\n\nThis talk will be a tutorial of how to get the most out of this library (http://quantopian.github.io/pyfolio/).\n\nSlides available here: \nhttp://www.slideshare.net/JessStauth/pydata-nyc-2015\n\nRelevant github repos:\nhttps://github.com/quantopian/pyfolio\nhttps://github.com/quantopian/zipline"
