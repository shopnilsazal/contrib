description: "Preetha Subbarayalu is a Senior Software Engineer on the Service Fabric team. She works on Reliable Collections and, specifically, the backing store that makes Reliable Collections reliably reliable. Deep interviews her and time is spent at the whiteboard digging into the architecture and implementation of Reliable Collections. \n\nReliable Collections enable you write highly-available, scalable, and low-latency cloud applications as though you were writing single computer applications. Remember the essence of Service Fabric articulated by our fearless leader, Gopal? The whole point of our blood, sweat, and tears is to make programming distributed systems easy, to make programming in the large feel like programming in the small. Tune in and see how this translates to what Preetha crafts.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nLinks:\n\nReliable Collections Docs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-reliable-collections\n\nTweet to @Carmine007 and @deepkkapur with ideas and feedback! We want to hear from you. Cheers!"
