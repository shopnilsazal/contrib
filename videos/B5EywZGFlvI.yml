recordingDate: 1433269161
description: "MiniKanren Philosophy by: Daniel P. Friedman\n\nDavid Nolen's popular core.logic library is based on miniKanren, a relational (logic) language embedded in Scheme. Two of the designers of miniKanren, William Byrd and Daniel Friedman, will describe the philosophy behind the design and implementation of miniKanren, and explain their thought process when writing miniKanren programs. They will also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of miniKanren, demonstrate several experimental language extensions, and explain what's next in the development of miniKanren."
