description: "Daniel Beck | Saturday 15:30 | Room A\n\n**Apologies for the poor quality video, the camera was unattended and the autofocus was being confused by something in the room.**\n\nIt could happen to you: your project is canceled, your team is “reorganized”, or your company is closing its doors. Some or all of your software, service, or API may not be long for this world. What will you say to the people using it? In this talk, you’ll learn how to cope when it’s time to break bad news to your users.\n\nWhether you’re deprecating significant features or shutting down entirely, you still have a chance to make life better—or at least a little less worse—for the people who have come to rely on your work. In this talk, you’ll learn how to:\n\n    cope with a stressful situation\n    plan your shutdown communications to make sure no users get left behind\n    let your users down easy with the appropriate voice, tone, and documentation\n\nFrom your initial announcement to your software's last day, you’ll learn how to say goodbye in a way that’s good for you and your soon-to-be-former users."
