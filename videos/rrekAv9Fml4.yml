description: "\"An introduction to PyTorch & Autograd\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - Anfiteatro 2]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nPyTorch is an optimized tensor library for Deep Learning, and is a recent newcomer to the growing list of GPU programming frameworks available in Python. Like other frameworks it offers efficient tensor representations and is agnostic to the underlying hardware. However, unlike other frameworks it allows you to create \"\"define-by-run\"\" neural networks resulting in dynamic computation graphs, where every single iteration can be different---opening up a whole new world of possibilities. Central to all neural networks in PyTorch is the Autograd package, which performs Algorithmic Differentiation on the defined model and generates the required gradients at each iteration. In this talk I will present a gentle introduction to the PyTorch library and overview its main features using some simple examples, paying particular attention to the mechanics of the Autograd package.\n\nKeywords: GPU Processing, Algorithmic Differentiation, Deep Learning, Linear algebra.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
