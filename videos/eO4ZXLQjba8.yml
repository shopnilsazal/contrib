description: "Presentation slides: http://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/avi-pfeffer-principal-scientist-charles-river-analytics\n\nPractical Probabilistic Programming with Figaro: Probabilistic reasoning enables you to predict the future, infer the past, and learn from experience. Probabilistic programming enables users to build and reason with a wide variety of probabilistic models without machine learning expertise. In this talk, I will present Figaro, a mature probabilistic programming system with many applications. I will describe the main design principles of the language and show example applications. I will also discuss our current efforts to fully automate and optimize the inference process."
