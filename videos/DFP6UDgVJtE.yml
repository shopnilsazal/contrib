This is because you're picking tools in the dark anyway, there is a 99% chance the tools you're picking are going to be wrong, so you might as well pick the one that you know really well.\n\nAfter you have your prototype, you should analyze it in order to find out what your needs are, and then take those needs with you when you wade through the vast amount of tools available, which will allow you to find the ones that are best for your app, and it's going to be a set of tools, not a single god-Leatherman. \n\nBlog entry by Adam Morse that I refer to in the video:\nhttp://xn--h4hg.ws/2015/07/27/too-many-tools/\n\nYou might want to read this article I wrote:\nhttp://www.quora.com/Why-did-Twitter-switch-to-a-Java-based-front-end-after-successfully-using-Rails-with-200-million-users/answer/Mattias-Petter-Johansson?share=1\n\nYou want to follow me on Twitter and Quora:\nhttps://twitter.com/mpjme\nhttp://www.quora.com/Mattias-Petter-Johansson"
