title: 'Lambda Jam 2014 - Ryan Senior - Contracts in Clojure with Schema'
recordingDate: 1410616845
description: 'Clojure has many tools for applying contracts to your code and improving it’s maintainability. This talk will briefly touch on several of the choices along with their benefits and drawbacks. The talk will then dive into Prismatic’s Schema library which has been used with a lot of success in the PuppetDB application. The talk will give an intro to Prismatic Schema, then discuss incrementally applying it to an existing codebase. The talk will discuss the benefits seen in PuppetDB after key pieces were migrated, including finding several existing bugs and users being able to self-diagnose configuration related issues. Finally it will discuss other uses for Schema metadata.'
