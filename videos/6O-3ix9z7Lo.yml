description: "Comparative studies in highways, organizations, automotive vehicles, teams, humility and patience by utilizing vagaries in both systems by Amanjeev Sethi\n\nI want you to imagine your organization as a freeway/highway and vehicles on it as the teams within the organization. Now, imagine if you could strip every major attribute you know about driving safely on a highway. What would it reveal about you, your team and your organization? In this talk, we will do this quick exercise and hopefully have some catharsis-based-revelations along the way."
