description: "This talk will introduce you to Industrial Ethernet Switches and their vulnerabilities. These are switches used in industrial environments, like substations, factories, refineries, ports, or other homes of industrial automation. In other words: DCS, PCS, ICS & SCADA switches.\n\nThe researchers focus on attacking the management plane of these switches, because we all know that industrial system protocols lack authentication or cryptographic integrity. Thus, compromising any switch allows the creation of malicious firmwares for further MITM manipulation of a live process. Such MITM manipulation can lead to the plant or process shutting down (think: nuclear reactor SCRAM) or getting into a unknown and hazardous state (think: damaging a blast furnace at a steel mill)\n\nNot only will vulnerabilities be disclosed for the first time, but the methods of finding those vulnerabilities will be shared. All vulnerabilities disclosed will be in the default configuration state of the devices. While these vulnerabilities have been responsibly disclosed to the vendors, SCADA/ICS patching in live environments tends to take 1-3 years. Because of this patching lag, the researchers will also be providing live mitigations that owner/operators can use immediately to protect themselves. At least four vendors switches will be examined: Siemens, GE, Garrettcom and Opengear.\n\nColin Cassidy is a security consultant for IOActive where he focuses on Industrial Control Systems.

He once placed second in an Eireann Leverett impersonation contest. He likes teaching the basics, and learning the obscure. He is sometimes jealous of his own moustache for being more famous than he is. If he could sum up his life in one sentence; he wouldn't. That would be a life-sentence! He is primarily known for smashing the myth of the air-gap in industrial systems with his master's thesis, finding authentication bypasses for industrial ethernet switches, and working with incident response teams to improve their understanding of industrial control systems security. He believes security takes an awful lot more than penetration-testing and speaks often about the wider effects of embedded system insecurity.\n\nTwitter: @blackswanburst\n\nRobert M.
