description: "Sriram Srinivasan, PayPal India Private Ltd.\n\nTroubleshooting of live site issues can be challenging especially when our production stack is made up of over 2000 applications and services. PayPalâ€™s SRE team is also involved in troubleshooting and driving resolution of the various live site issues reported by the customer and merchant support teams. Today to troubleshoot a live site issue, we go to multiple places depending on the issue at hand. Predominantly we go and look into the Centralized Application Logs. Then we also check the various data sources and the in-house alerts. There is so much of information to look for. A lot of effort goes into gathering data about the failed attempt/transaction from various sources internal to PayPal. Thus we needed an automated way to troubleshoot issues. So we have developed an Auto Troubleshooting Platform that aggregates the data from all the underlying data sources, troubleshoots and records the results. The Platform is built in a way that anyone can post any type of ticket and get it troubleshooted automatically. Auto Troubleshooting Results will be available in minutes and the same can be seen through a portal. In this talk, I will highlight the journey that we have undertaken in making this happen.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
