description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2017 by Steeve Morin, Zenly.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-53\n\nGoMobile is a technology that allows regular Go code to run on the phone and have it linked as regular libraries on both Android and iOS. It is used for both talking to the underlying system and to client apps.\n\nSince GoMobile has limited support for complex types and the callback/delegate pattern doesn't fit well with the Go paradigm, we will also present RxProto. RxProto allows to pass complex data types between the two runtimes in an easy and type safe manner. By leveraging Rx, it also provides seamless interfacing with the Go concurrency primitives without feeling foreign to the Android ecosystem.\n\nIn this talk we will present GoMobile, RxProto and the journey on how we wrote a common app backend for both our iOS and Android apps, starting with JSON/REST to Go/GRPC/Protobuf/Java.\n\nType: Android development\nExperience: expert\n\nAlex Karp Production"
