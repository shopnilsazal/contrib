recordingDate: 1460736390
description: "\"\nRocket League was a surprise success for Psyonix in 2015, but the game that launched emerged from a long process of feature cuts and failed prototypes. Join Psyonix design director Corey Davis in this 2016 talk as he discusses examples of how the Rocket League team avoided screwing up what evolved into a simple, but deep, experience by maintaining focus and exercising design restraint. Learn about how the team decided to focus on its single 'car soccer' game mode, expanded a niche hardcore game into a widely popular sequel, and made other small but critical decisions along the way using these principles.\"\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
