description: "Presented by Pete Graham\n\nWhat is functional programming, and when would you want to use it?\n\nCan you use Python to write programs in a functional style? Is this a good idea? What are the limitations, and when should you use an alternative functional language such as Haskell (Scala, Closure, Erlang, Lisp, etc)."
