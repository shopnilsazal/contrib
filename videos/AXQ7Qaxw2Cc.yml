description: "10,000 Yen into the Sea \nFLIPPER\n\nThe use of a pressure housing in an underwater vehicle can be difficult to implement without becoming a cost-center. Flipper will walk the audience through a new design for an Autonomous Underwater Glider which challenges assumptions about what is required or necessary to deploy sensors, transmitters, and payloads across long distances in the ocean. The speaker assumes no priory knowledge of subject matter & hopes the audience can help him to find new applications for this Open Source Hardware project.\n\nFlipper (@NickFLipper) is a hardware hacker obsessed with lowering the cost of underwater robots. Flipper spent 2 years as a member of his College's ROV team practicing waterproofing of CoTs components such as cameras, IMUs, and motors. These experiences inspired him to form the \"Mesa College\" team that participated in the 2011 & '12 AUVSI Robosub competition. During the first year of competition, the Mesa team took home a judges award for 'Innovation on a Budget'. Since that time Flipper has been employed by an EV manufacturer working to reduce the cost of high efficiency electric vehicles.\n\nMaterials: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Flipper/DEFCON-21-Flipper-10000-Yen.pdf \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Flipper/Extras.zip"
