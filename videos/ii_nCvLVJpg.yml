description: "Since these last few years our world has been getting smarter and smarter. We may ask ourselves: what does smart mean? It is the possibility of building systems which are nodes of a more complex network, digitally connected to the internet and to the final users. Our cities are becoming one of those networks and over time more and more elements are getting connected to such network: from traffic lights to information signs, from traffic and surveillance cameras to transport systems.\n\nThis last element, also called as Smart Mobility is the subject of our analysis, divided in three sub-element, each one describing a different method of transport in our city: Private transport: for this method we analyze the smart alternatives aimed to make parking activity easy, hassle free and more convenient Shared transport: we focus our attention on those systems which are sharing transport vehicles. In particular we deal with bike sharing which seems to be the most wide spread system in European cities Public transport: object of our analysis for this section is the bus, metro and tram network The aim of our analysis is understanding the ecosystem which each element belongs to and performing a security evaluation of such system. In this way the most plausible attack and fraud scenarios are pointed out and the presence of proper security measures is checked.\n\nAll the details discussed here are collected from a sample city, but the same methodology and concept can be applied to most of the smart cities in the world.\n\nBio:\nMatteo Beccaro is a security researcher, enrolled in Computer Engineering at Politecnico of Turin. He’s co-founder and CTO of Opposing Force s.r.l., the first Italian offensive physical security company. Matteo works and researches on network protocols, NFC and EACS security. He’s been selected as speaker at some of most prestigious international conferences like: DEF CON 21, 30th Chaos Communication Congress (30C3), BlackHat USA Arsenal 2014, DEF CON 22 SkyTalks, BlackHat Europe 2014, TetCon 2015, DEF CON 23 e ZeroNights 2015. As Chief Technical Officer of Opposing Force, Matteo works on vulnerability research activities and building physical intrusion.\n\nTwitter: @_bughardy_\n\nMatteo Collar is a student of Electronic Engineering at Politecnico di Torino. He has been studying Wireless networks and in the last few years he focused on NFC and Bluetooth. He presented the results of a progressive work of research at several conferences: DEF CON 21 (Las Vegas, 2013), 30C3 (Hamburg 2013), DEF CON Skytalks (Las Vegas, 2014), BlackHat USA 2014 Arsenal (Las Vegas), DEF CON 23 (Las Vegas, 2015), ZeroNights 2015 (Moscow) . He is going to continue his studies with a MSc in Electronic Engineering , Systems and Controls."
