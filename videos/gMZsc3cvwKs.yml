description: "Emily is an experimental language project focusing on simplifying the basis of programming languages: it models all language operations through composition of function-like entities, equivalent to combinators with state. This means functions, objects, classes, and variable scopes have the same interface and are generally interchangeable. The goal is to make FP language capabilities accessible to entry-level and FP-wary programmers by means of simple concepts and a configurable, scripting-language-like syntax.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HcNJ/"
