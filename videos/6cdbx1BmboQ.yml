title: 'GoGaRuCo 2013 - Built to Program by James Edward Gray II'
recordingDate: 1381334444
description: "James Edward Gray II has been programming long enough to learn a thing or two about how this computer stuff actually works. Nobody cares about that. Seriously, that's not the most common thing people ask him about. Instead, they often come with questions about why James tools around in an eletric wheelchair. Were legs just not hackable enough for his taste? Does he have a Charles Xavier complex? Does he not eat enough beta-carotene? James is ready to answer all of these questions. He believes the answers might even be just a little related to programming. Don't be surprised if you find yourself wishing for some neuromuscular disease of your very own. (Note: live genetic engineering is a violation of GoGaRuCo's insurance policy, but James can teach you how to fake a disability for the purposes of gaining deeper insight into codeâ€”allowable due to the Reprogrammed Humans for the Greater Good Act of 2442.)\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG7i/"
