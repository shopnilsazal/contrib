title: '#HITB2018AMS D1T2 - Smashing Ethereum Smart Contracts for Fun and ACTUAL Profit - Bernhard Mueller'
recordingDate: 1524555111
description: "Ethereum is an open software blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized apps. Over the past couple of years, its cryptocurrency Ether has taken the number two spot in market cap second to Bitcoin.\n\nIn Ethereum, state transitions are mediated by code (a.k.a “smart contracts”) running in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) which boasts a turing-complete instruction set, allowing for near-unlimited use cases including (but not limited to) crypto kitties. However, with great flexibility comes great potential for vulnerabilities. And in accordance to Murphy’s law, disaster has stricken several times, resulting in hundreds of millions worth of Ether being stolen or stuck in limbo for all eternity.\n\nIn this talk, I will investigate recent incidents, and shed light on the various types of flaws that occur in Ethereum smart contracts. I’ll show how to explore the blockchain and reverse engineer smart contract binary code using Mythril, the “nmap of Ethereum”. I’ll also demonstrate the use of symbolic analysis to detect different types of vulnerabilities, including those resulting from inter-contract calls. Finally, I’ll show how to autogenerate Ethereum exploits using the Z3 solver.\n\n=== \n\nBernhard is a security engineer at Consensys and a hacker with a decade-long track record. He has found dozens of zero day flaws in widely used software, published attacks on core Internet protocols, and written award-winning papers. He is also a winner of BlackHat’s “Best Research” Pwnie Award."
