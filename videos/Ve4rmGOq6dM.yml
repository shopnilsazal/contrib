title: 'DEF CON 24 Wireless Village - Brian Butterly and Stefan Kiese - Introducing the HackMeRF'
recordingDate: 1478726515
description: "During the past few years the IM-ME has gained quite some interest throughout the Hacker community. Initially designed and sold as a hardware chat toy/client for girls it consists of a simple display, QWERTY keyboard and a Sub-GHz RF enabled TI SoC (CC1110) with a 8051 controller. As the controller turned out to be re-programmable, various RF tools like spectrum analyzers and garage door bruteforcers have been implemented on just this platform. Sadly the device is becoming very rare, is slow and lacks memory for larger projects. In preperation for our home conference we decided to tribute the IM-ME by re-animating it as a conference badge based on TI's CC1310. Using the ARM Cortex M3 based SoC and a touch display we've created a sound successor - the HackMeRF. In our talk we will introduce the HackMeRF as an OpenHardware and OpenSource platform for RF hackers, researchers and developers. It will start with an overview of the IM-ME, as our inspiration, and further RF projects, which are currently available. Then, after covering the HackMeRF's development process and challenges, we will give a detailed insight into its components and hardware design. We will then present our current code base and show a few quick examples on how to implement protocols and get the device to talk. And, of course, we will show the actual device and present our current hardware design. As we want to make the HackMeRF available to everybody, we'd love to collect some feedback, ideas and further inspiration from the audience! ----------------------------- Some further technical information on the device can be found here: https://www.insinuator.net/2016/03/troopers-16-taking-the-badge-to-yet-another-level/ Our Website is sadly not quite finished, yet\"\n\nBios:\nBrian is a security researcher, analyst and simply a hacker at Heidelberg (Germany) based ERNW GmbH. Coming from the field of electronic engineering he tends to choose alternate approaches when hitting new projects. He currently works on the intersection of embedded-, mobile and telco-security, with tasks and research ranging from evaluating apps and devices through to analyzing their transport networks and backend infrastructures. Resulting from the broad range of practical experience and natural curiosity he has developed a very diverse set of skills and knowledge. He enjoys cracking open black boxes and learning about their details down to the electronic circuits and creating the tools he needs on the way. He is always happy to share his knowledge and findings.\n\n\nStefan works as a security researcher and analyst at ERNW and has extensive experience in hardware security. Through his former work he has background in SCADA and R&D of embedded systems. His personal main areas of interest are embedded systems, the IoT and – of course – their security issues."
