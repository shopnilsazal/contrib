title: 'Lone Star Ruby Conference 2011 State of the Art Telephony with Ruby by Ben Klang'
recordingDate: 1369718219
description: "The past 10 years has seen a revolution in the way we make phone calls and even the way we think about a telephone. Ruby is an ideal language to create power tools for building telephony applications. In this talk we will demonstrate how Ruby is the state of the art when it comes to interacting with the telephone network. Using the open source Adhearsion framework, we will demonstrate how you can easily integrate with existing Ruby applications or migrate legacy systems. We will cover how to get started immediately using cloud-based services, as well as how to build, deploy and manage your applications in-house. Network permitting, we will finish with a live demo designed to inspire ideas for ways you can integrate telephony into your application.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG9f/"
