recordingDate: 1502695053
description: 'Have you wondered how you can improve the performance of your applications under high load? You probably heard that reactive design can help meet better response time and make your applications more flexible. I will show you that you don’t need to rewrite your Java EE applications from scratch to achieve that. We’ll go through 5 ways how to reuse the knowledge of Java EE and Java 8 to improve your existing applications with a reactive design. We’ll apply them to a big production-like application step by step, walking through the code and demonstrating live. In the end, we’ll compare how much the performance and user experience can be improved. All that without learning a new framework or library, and limiting the amount of changes in the application source code to a bare minimum.'
