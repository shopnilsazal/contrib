recordingDate: 1510017335
description: 'Taking a modern day look on the 20 year anniversary of Craig Rowland''s article on Covert TCP, we explore current day methods of covert communications and demonstrate that we are not much better off at stopping these exploits as we were 20 years ago. With the explosion of networked devices using a plethora of new wired and wireless protocols, the covert communication exploit surface is paving new paths for covert data exfiltration and secret communications. In this session, we will explore uPnP, Zigbee, WiFi, P25, Streaming Audio Services, IoT, and much more. Through real-world examples, sample code, and demos; we bring to light this hidden world of concealed communications.'
