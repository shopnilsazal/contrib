description: "We are back after a long break with GoingNative #63, where Steve Carroll chats with Andrew Pardoe about the Visual Studio 2017 Build Tools and daily compiler builds on myget.org!\n\nThe Build Tools is an alternative wau to get the compiler, libraries, and Windows SDKs for C++ development without having to install the IDE. Great for build servers, CI servers, and other environments where an IDE is not necessary. You can download the Build Tools at: http://aka.ms/buildtools.\n\nWe also now offer a way to get the very latest \"hot off the press\" version of the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler at: https://visualcpp.myget.org/gallery/dailymsvc. If you want to test out the very latest features without having to wait, and give feedback on how the compiler is doing, this is the way to do it."
