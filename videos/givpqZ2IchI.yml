description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nConquering a Kubeflow Kubernetes Cluster with ksonnet, Ark, and Sonobuoy - Kris Nova, Heptio & David Aronchick, Google (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nKubernetes provides a unique environment for running distributed applications. In this demonstration we learn how Ark, Sonobuoy, and ksonnet are helping to craft a kubernetes configuration build for rock solid machine learning. In this talk we explore a kubernetes cluster configured for infrastructure optimization as well as data experimentation, model porting, and cloud specific configurations for advanced machine learning. We learn about the constructs behind the kubeflow project, and take ownership of them and our infrastructure with Ark and ksonnet. We validate the health of the cluster with Sonobuoy, and ensure that as machine learning engineers we are operating the healthiest cluster we can.\n\nAbout David\nDavid Aronchick was the Senior Product Manager for the Google Container Engine and led product management on behalf of Google for Kubernetes. David has been helping to ship software for nearly 20 years, founding and being part of the management team for three different startups, as well as squeezing in time at Microsoft, Amazon, Chef, and now Google. David is co-founder of the Kubeflow project, an effort to help developers and enterprises deploy and use ML cloud-natively everywhere.\n\nAbout Kris\nKris Nova is a Senior Developer Advocate for Heptio. She is a Kubernetes maintainer and contributor. She wrote the book on cloud native infrastructure. She spends her free time climbing mountains."
