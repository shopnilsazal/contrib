description: "This 2014 talk from developer Navid Khonsari addresses the challenges of telling real stories via the most popular medium of our time. Video games have traditionally avoided real-life narratives, but the influence of engaging with real-life events and the unparalleled impact it can have as a new form of entertainment is not only groundbreaking, but the inevitable next step for our industry. Using the 1979 Iranian Revolution game as a case study, the audience will learn about how to establish and be effective in this new genre.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
