description: 'REST APIs are the language of the web. Though simple to build, it''s also very easy to mess them up. You end up with a convoluted API, that''s hard to understand and even worse to use. I want to show you how to create REST APIs that are both comprehensible are maintainable and make your fellow developers happy.'
