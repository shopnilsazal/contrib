description: "*Note: Recorded from a live event\n\nAt the end of May 2013, Fluent returns to San Francisco for its second year. In addition to our continued, core focus on JavaScript and HTML5, Fluent is expanding its scope this year to include a broader scope of tools and technologies driving the front-end Web — including Node.js, Angular JS, mobile, the hottest APIs, and the business side of the Web.\n\nIn this free online conference, attendees will get a practical sneak peek at some of the most important topics we'll be covering at Fluent. If you're a developer, engineer, or are invested in the future of the Web in any way, It's your chance to see what we're covering and to find those can't-miss tracks and sessions. \n\nAbout the Presenters\n\n\"this\" in JavaScript - How It Really Works\nMartha Girdler - Etsy\n\nThe resolution of \"this\" in JavaScript is often a confusing subject for developers. I aim to take the magic out of \"this\" by describing the different scenarios functions can be called and how it affects the value of \"this.\"\nAbout Martha Girdler\n\n\nHardware Access and Device APIs with JavaScript and HTML5\nWes Bos\n\nThe browser on your device is growing up! With new HTML5 APIs we are able to access your device's hardware and start writing apps that rival native big boys. HTML5 APIs include access the the device's camera, microphone, GPS, compass file system and accelerometer. This talk will take a look at what we can start integrating into our apps today as well as what we can look forward to in future releases of mobile browsers. Be sure to make it out to this as as it will be packed with fantastic examples including a mobile based motion detection security camera and a CSS3 speedometer!\n\n\nPrototyping à la Node with Express\nPam Selle - AxisPhilly\n\nThis talk will discuss the how and why of rapid prototyping and user testing, a quick sample of simple testing methods, and how you can use Express.js (with git, Node, and Heroku) to get your prototype up at at 'em—with skills you already have.\n\nPrinciples of AngularJS\nBrad Green and Shyam Seshadri\n\nAngular brings together data binding, HTML extension, dependency injection, and a host of other powerful techniques for building modern web applications. In this talk, we'll describe why we picked these idioms and the development experience we're trying to achieve for both rapid prototyping and large-scale application development.\n\nAbout: Peter Cooper\n\nPeter Cooper is the founder of Cooper Press and the editor of several weekly newsletters, including JavaScript Weekly, and co-host of The JavaScript Show as well as the editor of several popular Ruby Web sites and author of Beginning Ruby. He publishes programming oriented e-mail newsletters, podcasts, screencasts and blogs full-time.\n\nHe also chairs O'Reilly's JavaScript and Web technology conference, Fluent.\n\nSimon St. Laurent\n\nSimon St. Laurent is a web developer, network administrator, computer book author, and XML troublemaker living in the Town of Dryden, NY. His books include Learning Rails, XML: A Primer, XML Elements of Style, Cookies, Office 2003 XML, and the XML Pocket Reference.\n\nYou can find his writing on everything from technology to Quakerism to life in Dryden to gardening to New York State politics aggregated at simonstl.com."
