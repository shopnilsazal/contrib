description: 'In October of 2016, a teenage hacker triggered DTDoS attacks against 9-1-1 centers across the United States with five lines of code and a tweet. This talk provides an in-depth look at the attack, and reviews and critiques the latest academic works on TDoS attacks directed at 9-1-1 systems. It then discusses potential mitigation strategies for legacy TDM and future all-IP access networks, as well as disaggregated "over-the-top" originating services and the devices on which both the access network providers and originating service providers rely.'
