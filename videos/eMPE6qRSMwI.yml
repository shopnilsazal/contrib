description: "Stefan Koopmanschap , Enrico Zimuel\n\nThe next generation of frameworks is upon us, and now that they're more decoupled and component-based than ever before and use the same standard for naming and autoloading, there is no reason to stick to a single framework for your projects. During this session, we will go through several ways of combining Symfony2 and Zend Framework 2, so that you walk away being able to focus even more on on writing the complex custom logic your project needs, and don't have to worry about the rest.\n\nhttps://joind.in/talk/view/9364\n\nhttp://www;afup.org"
