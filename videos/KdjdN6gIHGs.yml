title: 'DEF CON 13 - Metalstorm, Trust Transience: Post Intrusion SSH Hijacking'
recordingDate: 1391732764
description: "Metalstorm, Trust Transience: Post Intrusion SSH Hijacking\n\nTrust Transience: Post Intrusion SSH Hijacking explores the issues of transient trust relationships between hosts, and how to exploit them. Applying technique from anti-forensics, linux VXers, and some good-ole-fashioned blackhat creativity, a concrete example is presented in the form of a post-intrusion transparent SSH connection hijacker. The presentation covers the theory, a real world demonstration, the implementation of the SSH Hijacker with special reference to defeating forensic analysis, and everything you'll need to go home and hijack yourself some action.\n\nMetalstorm is a deathmetal listening linux hippy from New Zealand. When not furiously playing air-guitar, he works for linux integrator and managed security vendor Asterisk in Auckland, New Zealand. Previous work has placed him in ISP security, network engineering, linux systems programming, corporate whore security consultancy and a brief stint at the helm of a mighty installation of solaris tar. Amongst his preoccupations at the moment are the New Zealand Supercomputer Centre, wardriving-gps-visualization software that works in the southern hemisphere, and spreading debian and python bigotry. Oh, and his band 'Orafist' needs a drummer - must have own kit and transport to New Zealand."
