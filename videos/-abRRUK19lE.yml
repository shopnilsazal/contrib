description: "Lex Hider\nhttp://2013.pycon-au.org/schedule/30044/view_talk\nIn the immortal words of that modern day philosopher Homer Jay Simpson: \"Can't Someone Else Do It?\"                                                     \n                                                                                \nIf you're too lazy to configure your own servers: let Salt do it for you. Salt is an open source configuration management tool like Chef or Puppet but written in Python using ZeroMQ."
