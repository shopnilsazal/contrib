description: "How does Bundler work, anyway? by Andre Arko\n\nWe all use Bundler at some point, and most of us use it every day. But what does it do, exactly? Why do we have to use bundle exec? What's the point of checking in the Gemfile.lock? Why can't we just gem install the gems we need? Join me for a walk through the reasons that Bundler exists, and a guide to what actually happens when you use it. Finally, we'll cover some Bundler \"pro tips\" that can improve your workflow when developing on multiple applications at once.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H0pf/"
