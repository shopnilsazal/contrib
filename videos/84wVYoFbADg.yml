description: "by Pierre Ozoux\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nFree Software on the desktop was cool in the 2000s, but nowadays, we needFLOSS as a Service. If you go to dropbox, you signup with your email/password,boom, you get your cloud. If you go to Nextcloud.com, the call to action is\"download\". We'll never reach the 99%, we need a signup button on every freesoftware landing page. libre.sh is paving the way toward that direction. Thefirst step is to have an infrastructure to orchestrate these softwares.\n\nDuring this presentation, I'll show you how we leverage the power of docker tomanage hundreds of containers that deliver FLOSS as a Service for the 99%.I'll quickly explain why we choose docker. Then, I'll dive into showing, live,how to setup a full server with:\n\n  * HAProxy with let's encrypt  * Rocket.Chat  * GitLab  * ELK (for log collection)\n\nAnd all in less than 20 minutes. So then, you have no excuses to not host freesoftware for you and/or your organization :)\n\nlibre.sh in numbers:\n\n  * installed on 5 servers (4 different organizations) (that I know)  * running hundreds of containers  * offering 24 different applications (chat, git, cloud, mail...)  * with a wide range of different stacks (MySQL, Postgres, Mongo, PHP, Ruby, NodeJS...)  * and 4 modules (log collection, monitoring, backups, proxy)  * developped since 2 years\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:30:00"
