description: "By Team Yamanekko  (Yurie Yamane & Masayoshi Takahashi)\n\nLet's control physical devices using mruby on your board!\n\nmruby has not been released yet, but you don't have to wait for it. \nCurrent mruby is good enough for prototyping or learing.\n\nIf you have cheap microcontroller boards like STM32F4Discovery or Raspberry Pi, \nyou can run mruby on them and control physical devices, without other computers \nto control them. And if you have right mrbgems, what you need is writing \nsmall Ruby code, neither C nor assembler.\n\nIn this session, we will talk about how to use mruby and how to create \nand use mrbgems so as to controll LEDs, buttons, accelerometer and so on.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4o/"
