title: 'Back to BASICS - Back-pressured Asynchronous Scalable Immutable Composable Streams by Viktor Klang'
language: English
recordingDate: 1447405618
description: "Stream processing, to quote Mugatu, \"is so hot right now\".\n\nIn this presentation we'll explore fast data streaming using Akka Streams, an implementation of Reactive Streams, and how to design robust transformation pipelines—with built-in flow control—able to take advantage of multicore and going over networks.\n\nWe'll discuss possible pitfalls and how they can be avoided as well as explore how we can define immutable pieces of processing logic, as data we can reuse via composition—a veritable smorgasbord of stream transformations that transparently takes advantage of multicore hardware when executed."
