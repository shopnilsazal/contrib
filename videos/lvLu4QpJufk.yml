recordingDate: 1516816560
description: 'Apart from cool new features like the Java module system, a new process API and a brand new Java shell Java 9 also brings a lot of cool new security enhancements. These include DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security), extensions to the TLS negotiation, default PKCS12 stores and others. These may sound a bit specific at first and one may ask: what are their practical applications ? In the session we will demonstrate all those new features in a series of examples with some gory details. Session overview: - recap: TLS support up to JDK 8 via the JSSE (Java Secure Socket Extension) - demo: custom Java application server that integrates banking applications via different protocols and provides JSSE support - DTLS support in JDK 9 (as provided by JEP 219) - demo: the application server is extended with DTLS support (as provided by JDK 9) in order to support a legacy unrelaiable banking protocol - overview of the TLS protocol negoation extension in JDK 9 (as provided JEP 244) - demo: extending the application server and existing integrations with TLS protocol negotation - overview of the rest of the security enhancements in JDK 9 in a series of short examples around the sample application server Target level: expert.'
