Similarly, I'm able to trip other GFCI's (the type built-in to several apartment/home walls) creating a DoS on running electro domestics.\n\nElectro domestics might not be the worst this vulnerability has to offer, since GFCI's are used on many different types of electronics.\n\nI plan on building a directional antenna to hopefully perform remote electro domestic DoS. I will list all vulnerable patents, my discovered vulnerable products, all applicable frequencies, and all affected switch types (such as AFCI's). I also commit to do responsible disclosure of any sensitive electrical attacks, such as RF interference for equipment upon which people's lives or livelihoods may depend.\n\nMaggie Jauregui (@MagsJauregui) owns end-to-end Security Validation for the Wireless Product R&D group at Intel Corporation. She has around 3 years of security validation experience, specifically doing fuzzing, secure code review, and ad hoc penetration testing. At her previous job, Maggie owned DirectX Security Validation for the Graphics Driver Team at Intel Mexico after an internship in the 3D team doing Graphics Driver Sanity validation for the same group. Maggie studied her Bachelor in Computer Science at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara (2005-2010). Maggie's interests also include genetics, singing (lead female vocal of Agavers rock band), and modern/classic dancing.\n\nLinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/pub/maggie-jauregui/46/26a/358 \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/magsjauregui"
