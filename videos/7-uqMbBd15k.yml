Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nScaling Non-Traditional Contributor Mentoring Initiatives - Paris Pittman, Google (Any Skill Level)\n\nContributor growth is vital to the health of any open source project. So how do you do it? The common practice of 1:1 mentoring doesn't scale - takes up a considerable number of resources and forced relationships can be toxic. However, help in finding a mentor continues to be one of the most frequent requests by new contributors. What do you do when you have major skill gaps or need contributors of certain roles in large numbers? This talk will discuss modern, non-traditional approaches that can be applied to Kubernetes. We will cover the current strategies of the project, provide an update, and showcase how you can get involved.\n\nAbout Paris\nParis is a Developer Relations Program Manager on the Google Cloud Open Source Strategy team focusing on Kubernetes Community. She has 13 years of professional experience in attracting and retaining engineering talent for organizations and open source projects. She has also been organizing communities in one form or another for over 20 years, and at one point ran enough meetups to subsist solely on the free pizza leftovers."
