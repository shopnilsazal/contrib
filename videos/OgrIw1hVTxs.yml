description: "Meet Alex Wun, a Principal Software Engineer working on Service Fabric's Management core subsystem. Specifically, Alex owns the Cluster Manager which is responsible for orchestrating app, service, and cluster deployments and upgrades. In fact, the very notion of an application in Service Fabric terms is made possible by the Cluster manager. What does that mean, exactly? Tune in and find out. \n\nIn this interview Alex does a great job of describing the code behind the concepts he's sharing at the whiteboard. Please spend time here: http://aka.ms/sfrepo and specifically in the src/prod/src/management/clustermanager directory."
