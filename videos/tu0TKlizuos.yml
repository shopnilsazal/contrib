title: 'Tom Radcliffe  - Robust Algorithms for Machine Learning'
recordingDate: 1500674435
description: "PyData Seattle 2017\n\nMany companies implementing Machine Learning (ML) have learned that noise and other errors in the data set can cause stability issues resulting in time loss and headache.\n\nRobust algorithms are under-appreciated, particularly by people new to data analysis. This talk will review the basic idea of robust or non-parametric algorithms and look at some of the more important named algorithms, as well as looking at how to apply the philosophy of robustness to any problem."
