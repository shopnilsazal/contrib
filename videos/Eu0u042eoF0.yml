recordingDate: 1475782489
description: "PyData Carolinas 2016\n\nIn this talk we will look at a few machine learning algorithms and their Python implementations to build AI's that can play LaserCat, a video game written with Pygame. We start with building an imitation AI that can imitate a human player's decision-making. Then we build a self-evolving AI that can explore and learn on its own to eventually achieve super-human level."
