description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nContainer Storage Interface: Present and Future - Jie Yu, Mesosphere, Inc. (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nThe goal of Container Storage Interface (CSI) is to provide a standard API allowing a storage provider to write just one plugin that will work for all major container orchestration systems: Kubernetes, Mesos, Docker and Cloud Foundry. As the original co-author of the spec, Jie will give you an overview about CSI, and talk about many of the design decisions that were made earlier in the process and the rationales behind those design decisions. As an Apache Mesos PMC and committer, Jie will further discuss CSI from a container orchestrator's perspective and talk about why this interface makes the container orchestrator's life much easier. Finally, he will talk about the CSI support recently introduced in Mesos, and show you how seamless the integration is, and how easy it is to deploy a CSI plugin in Mesos.\n\nAbout Jie\nJie Yu is a Tech Lead at Mesosphere, Inc, focused on containerization, storage and networking. Jie is an Apache Mesos PMC member and committer, and is the co-author and maintainer of the Container Storage Interface (CSI) spec. Before joining Mesosphere, Jie was a software engineer at Twitter. Jie obtained his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan. Jie has spoken at various academic and industry conferences like OSS Summit, QCon, MesosCon, OOPSLA, MICRO, etc."
