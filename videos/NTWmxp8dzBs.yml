description: "Droidcon Paris 2015\nTasks are the plumbing of Android apps: you use them every day when developing. But the Task API in Android is one of the most difficult API to apprehend. The behaviour fragmentation between the Android versions does not help us either: taskAffinity, launchMode, flags, etc. In addition to the Task API, Android 5.0 introduced the Document Task API. This new feature is a big upheaval on how we manage tasks as Android developers and users.\n\nIn this presentation, we will have an in depth look at these APIs. We will see how to use them in typical use cases: an application with some restricted content to user connected with account but not all, an application with multiple documents opened in parallel, etc. \n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/mathieu_calba/task-and-document-api\n\nDroidcon Paris 2015, more information here: http://droidcon.fr/schedule/"
