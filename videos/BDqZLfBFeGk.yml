description: "Flow Control in JavaScript is hard! Native Promises in JavaScript have helped immensely, but the syntax is still a little callback-y. With Async + Await, we can write synchronous looking code without losing any of the benefits of JavaScript's asynchronous nature.\n\nWes explores how async + await works, best practices for flow control, and explores several solutions for handling errors.\n\nEVENT: \n\ndotJS 2017\n\nSPEAKER: \n\nWes Bos\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published on dotconferences YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\ndotconferences YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSRhwaM00ay0fasnsw6EXKA?spfreload=5\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YkUCxvaLEk&t=2s\n\nThumbnail: Shreyas Amargol"
