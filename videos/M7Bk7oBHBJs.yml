description: "by François Déchelle\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\n# The Armadito antivirus project\n\nWe will present Armadito, an open source and multi-platform antivirus. Itsoriginal modular architecture allows third-party developers to add their ownmalware detection modules, written in C and in the future in Python or Go.Current modules are signature-based (ClamAV), rules-based (YARA) orheuristics. It provides also real-time detection on GNU/Linux and MS-Windows.\n\nArmadito provides graphical user interfaces to notify of malware detection,launch scan, view statistics and journal. A central administration console,integrated as a GLPi plug-in, allows a system administrator to manage all theinstalled antivirus, view alerts, launch remote scans, deploy configuration orbases.\n\nProject has several opened issues that are not addressed yet: high memoryfootprint, sandboxing for scan modules, automatic generation of signaturebases from automatic malware collecting. Contributions from the free softwarecommunity would be highly appreciated.\n\nArmadito project is on github: (https://github.com/armadito)\n\n# The Armadito antivirus project\n\n## What is it?\n\nArmadito is an open source antivirus, that runs on GNU/Linux and MS-Windows.Its modular architecture allows easy integration of new detection algorithms.\n\nArmadito provides standard antivirus features: on-demand scan, quarantine,alerts, journal and real-time (or \"on-access\") protection. This protection isimplemented on GNU/Linux using fanotify and on MS-Windows with its own driver.\n\n## Modular architecture\n\nArmadito scans files using scan _modules_ , which are plugins written in C andusing a common API (load, configure, scan, unload).\n\nCurrent modules are:\n\n  * ClamAV using libclamav  * YARA  * heuristic for PE and ELF binaries  * heuristic for PDF documents\n\nA future extension is to allow writing modules in Python and Go languages.\n\n## User interfaces\n\nArmadito provides 2 user interfaces:\n\n  * a lightweight graphical user interface, showing only notifications plus \"systray\" icon, developed using native toolkits  * a full interface, developed using web technologies (AngularJS), that runs in a browser and uses the antivirus REST API\n\n## Antivirus administration\n\nThe installed antivirus can be managed from a central console, that allowsthrough a web interface to view alerts, launch remote scans, deploy new basesor configuration. This console is integrated as a GLPi plugin.\n\n## Next steps\n\nFuture developments of the project are:\n\n  * update MS-Windows code and release a MS-Windows version with installers  * make extensive testing  * improve documentation  * re-implement the heuristic module for PE/ELF binaries analysis  * provide an API to allow scan modules to be implemented in Python and GO  * improve code quality using sonarqube  * contribute to IRMA with Armadito plugin  * make Armadito antivirus be available inside virustotal.com and AVCaesar\n\n## Issues\n\nThe project has several opened issues which are not obvious to address:\n\n  * memory footprint is too high, approximately 450M when using the ClamAV module, when compared to standard antivirus which have a momory footprint in the order of 100M  * scan modules should run inside a sandbox because they parse complex formats and unpackers, and a bug in the parser or a deliberately malformed file can crash the module and therefore compromise the entire antivirus  * providing up-to-date and good \"signature\" bases is yet to be done; it requires a strong architecture for malware collecting and automatic signature (likely YARA rules) generation\n\nThe current team is small and contributions from the free software communitywould be highly appreciated.\n\n## Links\n\nCode: [github.com/armadito](https://github.com/armadito)\n\nDocumentation: [armadito-av.readthedocs.io](http://armadito-av.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\nTalk: [gitter.im/armadito/armadito-av](https://gitter.im/armadito/armadito-av)\n\nUbuntu PPA:[launchpad.net/~armadito](https://launchpad.net/~armadito/+archive/ubuntu/armadito-av)\n\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 13:40:00"
