description: "DEF CON the Mystery, Myth and Legend \nPanel\n\nIt's hard to throw a stone these days without hitting a security/hacking conference. But, when every year the Las Vegas Metro SWAT Team stages for an interdiction of your convention, you know you have something \"different\". From crawling through Air Ducts to surreptitiously \"acquiring\" telco equipment, these are the stories of DEF CON you don't often hear about. The stories of yesteryear that not only helped shape defcon but also the people who make up today's hacker and infosec communities at large. DEF CON is the event that helped spawn a generation of hackers and changed the landscape of information security. So come join us for a trip down memory lane as we reveal some of the secrets and stories of what architected the mystery, myth and legend of the hacker community you see today... Now that the statues of limitation have passed.\n\nPanel classified until further notice"
