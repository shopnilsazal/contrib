description: "Adam Bresson - Palm OS Security\n\nMy talk will focus on protection of info and device via encryption/decryption, Palm OS / hardware architecture, and the structure of a Palm application. Techniques for implementing security for information, accessing Palm system modes and understanding code will be covered.\n\nMy Background: I'm a three year veteran of the Palm scene affiliated with PDAZone, PalmWarez and PalmOlive. I am dedicated to understanding the system and operational functions of the world's first usable PDA. I believe a Palm can do a whole lot more than just store numbers and appointments. My discussion will share my deep knowledge of this device. \n\nDEF CON 8.0 was held July 28th - 30th, 2000, in Las Vegas, Nevada USA"
