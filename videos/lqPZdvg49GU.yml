description: "RailsConf 2018: Automating Empathy: Test Your Docs with Swagger and Apivore by Ariel Caplan\n\nUgh, documentation.\n\nIt's the afterthought of every system, scrambled together in the final days before launch, updated sparingly, generally out of date.\n\nWhat if we could programmatically verify that our API documentation was accurate? What if this helped us build more intuitive APIs by putting our users first? What if documentation came first, and helped us write our code?\n\nWith Swagger and Apivore as our weapons of choice, we'll write documentation that will make your APIs better, your clients more satisfied, and you happier."
