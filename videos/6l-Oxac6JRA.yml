description: "by Daniel Borkmann\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThis talk presents an overview of the Linux kernel's eBPF subsystem and how itintegrates into tc (traffic control) and XDP (eXpress Data Path) for providinga high-performance, in-kernel programmable networking data plane. Since thelast fosdem, many new eBPF-related features found its way into the Linuxkernel. This talk highlights some of the most important advances along withsome examples on how this facility can be programmed.\n\n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 12:00:00"
