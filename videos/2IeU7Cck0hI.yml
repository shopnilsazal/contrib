This presentation will go over a brief history of home automation techniques, cover modern technologies used today, detail some of the current exploits used against modern automation and security systems, and give examples on how to defend against them. Youâ€™ll be provided with the knowledge necessary to build your own home-Skynet system- complete with passive and active defenses against physical and wireless attacks. If you like Raspberry Pis, RF hacks, dirty soldering jobs, and even dirtier code, then this is your talk.\n\nChris Littlebury is a Senior Penetration Tester with Knowledge Consulting Group (KCG). He enjoys hardware hacking, turning wrenches, and opportunities to combine the two. He also claims to have created the first Raspberry Pi-powered, wireless BBQ smoker."
