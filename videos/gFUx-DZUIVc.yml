description: "Rails is the New Rails  by: Michael Bleigh\n\nThe sweeping changes brought on by Rails 3 and 3.1 havenâ€™t just make our existing development patterns easier, they have opened up the ability for us to build new patterns that accomplish more in a more beautiful and efficient way. In this session you will see how thinking about new features in a different light can lead to real innovation for your development practices. Examples include baking routing constraints into your models, application composition with Rack, truly modular design with the asset pipeline, and more."
