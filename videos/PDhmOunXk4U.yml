description: "GDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.  Subscribe to the channel to stay on top of regular updates, and check out GDC Vault  for thousands of more in-depth talks from our archives.\n\nFollow us on Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/Official_GDC\n\nWhen children are the game's core audience, we cannot rely solely on traditional techniques for running playtesting studies; instead, we must adapt to ensure the participants are able to give meaningful responses. Using Skylanders Swap Force as an example, this 2014 talk from Activision's Gareth Griffiths outlines the approaches we use at Activision to run successful studies with children, and the techniques we developed to collect and make sense of the data. Using examples from actual studies, we will show how children of differing ages uncovered a diverse range of issues - from character creation to level design. \nCheckout our Facebook page for GDC exclusives\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GameDevelopersConference\n\nhttp://www.gdconf.com/"
