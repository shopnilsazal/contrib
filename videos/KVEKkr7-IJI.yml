description: "Extending Kubernetes: Our Journey & Roadmap [I] - Daniel Smith & Eric Tune, Google\n\nWhat is the vision for Kubernetes Extensibility? Do you know the difference between initializers, cloud providers, and the CRI? In this talk we will describe how extension points in Kubernetes have evolved and go over the options today, and what they let you do. As we go over the extension points, we’ll give our vision for how they will evolve in the future, and talk about the sorts of things we expect the broader Kubernetes ecosystem to build out of them.\n\nAbout Daniel Smith\nCurrently TL of Kubernetes’ API Machinery sub-team, Daniel has been working on Kubernetes since before it was open sourced, and contributed enough in the early days that he’s still one of the top contributors overall. Before that, Daniel worked on Google’s borg and AppEngine. He lives in Mountain View with his wife and two children.\n\nAbout Eric Tune\nEric has worked on Kubernetes since before the first public release. He has contributed to Security, Tenancy, Application Controllers, Charts, Jobs, documentation, and more. Before Kubernetes, he worked on Google's Borg system, on datacenter-scale efficiency and performance measurement, and on web search."
