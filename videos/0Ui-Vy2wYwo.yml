description: "By, Benjamin Tan Wei Hao\n\nThis talk is about Elixir â€“ a functional, meta-programming aware language built on top of the Erlang VM.\n\nI introduce some of Elixir's more interesting language features. Then I will demonstrate some of the features that Erlang gives Elixir for free, such as the OTP framework, that let's you build fault tolerant and distributed systems.\n\nSo come along and join me to experience programming joy.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FrUX/"
