description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nViktor Klang - Chief Architect at Typesafe\n\nABSTRACT\nStream-based programming holds the promise of unifying IO with traditional Functional Programming manipulation of collections. In this session we will introduce you to Akka Streams—an asynchronous Stream-based programming library with non-blocking back pressure implemented on top of Akka—an implementation of the Actor Model. We'll demonstrate the Flow API—a lifted representation—as well as a pluggable way of transforming the lifted representation into the execution representation—Flow Materialization. We will also discuss the implications of non-blocking back pressure for fan-in (many producers to single consumer) as well as fan-out (single producer to many consumers) as well as discuss dynamic runtime optimization as well as compile time optimization.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
