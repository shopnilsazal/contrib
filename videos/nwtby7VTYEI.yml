description: 'In engineering we apply systematic thinking to business and technical problems. This skill is also present in other fields, and with domain specific knowledge we can apply the same systematic thinking to other parts of our lives. We will talk about dietetics and nutrition for hackers, and how choosing your diet is like choosing your software libraries, including evidence-based analysis, library/project implementation, and testing.
