title: 'GeeCON Prague 2017: Vaclav Pech - JetBrains MPS - why modern language workbenches matter'
recordingDate: 1516816639
description: 'People often develop dialects and domain-specific lingo that let them describe things accurately and communicate effectively. Language workbenches bring the same flexibility into the world of programming languages. The need for high-level computer domain-specific languages is universal and can be identified both in academia and in industry. JetBrains MPS is an open-source language workbench that clients from many industries have chosen to implement their DSLs. Weâ€™ll see real-life examples from domains such as medicine, insurance, embedded software development, bioinformatics, enterprise systems and legislation. Why do companies invest in DSLs? What are the key benefits for them? How do the typical DSLs look like and how they are implemented? I want to answer these fundamental question during this practical session.'
