description: '“How do I get more people using my app and more feedback from my users?” This looks like a job for the #WindowsInsiders program! This session showcases some of the ways in which being an Insider helps you as a developer such as getting your app integrated into Feedback Hub, amplification of your app to our giant community, career coaching and our brand new, top-secret Cohorts-As-A-Service offering.  You’ll also get to meet other Insider app devs and hear their stories of success.'
