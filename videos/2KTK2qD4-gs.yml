description: "Developers are constantly throwing around jargon and buzz words when describing applications and talking through code. To a new engineer, it can seem like we’re speaking an entirely different language. One might assume we’ve tried come up with semantic metaphors for what we’re doing, but how often do we actually stop to think about where these terms came from?
