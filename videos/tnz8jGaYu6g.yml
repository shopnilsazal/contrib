recordingDate: 1525249449
description: 'Apart from cool new features like the Java module system, a new process API and a brand new Java shell Java 9 also brings a lot of cool new security enhancements. These include DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security), extensions to the TLS negotiation, default PKCS12 stores and others. These may sound a bit specific at first and one may ask: what are their practical applications ? In the session we will demonstrate all those new features in a series of examples with some gory details. The session will first provide background information on the support for TLS in JDK 8 and use that knowledge to demonstrate the new security enhancements by building separate modules for a simple banking application server used as a showcase - namely a simple XMPP module that demonstrates how to leverage ALPN for protocol negotiation and a simple SIP module that demonstrates how to get started with DTLS.'
