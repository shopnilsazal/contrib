description: "Thanks to Python and R, data scientists and researchers have in hands highly powerful tools to program with data, simulate and publish reproducible computational results. Educators have access to free and open environments to teach efficiently statistics and numerical subjects. Thanks to cloud computing, anyone can work today on advanced high capacity technological infrastructures without having to build them or to comply with rigid and limiting access protocols. By combining the power of Python, R and public clouds such as Amazon EC2, it became possible to build a new generation of collaboration-centric platforms for virtual data science and virtual education of considerable power and flexibility.\n\nThis tutorial aims to familiarise the attendees with what public clouds can do for e-Science and e-Learning, to present the challenges and opportunities raised by the use of Python and R on such infrastructures and to introduce Elastic-R, one of the first free Python/R-centric virtual data science platforms (www.elasticr.com)."
