description: "In this GDC 2015 Indie Soapbox microtalk, Ashley Zeldin of Adorkable Games discusses her approach to failures, in an effort to have the game dev community not hide from things that didn't work, but embrace them as a way to learn and grow towards success.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
