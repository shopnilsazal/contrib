description: "Matheus Rossato and Luiz Muller, ContaAzul\n\nWe will share how a small startup in Brazil went from a small hundreds to thousands of customers on our platform with a small Ops team and evolved to a central SRE team, and other SRE members distributed on other teams. We intend to point out how SRE diverts from Ops and why we weren't doing real DevOps."
