description: "Data Science for Good: Stopping Illegal Deforestation Using Deep Learning:\nInterested in using your data skills to give back? Delta Analytics is a Bay Area non-profit that provides free data science consulting to grant recipients all over the world. Rainforest Connection, a Delta grant recipient, worked with Delta fellows to detect illegal deforestation by applying deep learning to audio streamed from rainforests in Peru, Ecuador and Brazil. We will share insights from our work with Rainforest Connection, discuss our fellowship and partnership process, and suggest some best practices for skill based volunteering."
