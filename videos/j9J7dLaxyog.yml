title: 'RailsConf 2015 - Bending the Curve: How Rust Helped Us Write Better Ruby'
recordingDate: 1431532095
description: "by Yehuda Katz and Tom Dale\n\nRuby is a productive language that developers love. When Ruby isn't fast enough, they often fall back to writing C extensions. But C extensions are scary for a number of reasons; it's easy to leak memory, or segfault the entire process. When we started to look at writing parts of the Skylight agent using native code, Rust was still pretty new, but its promise of low-level control with high-level safety intrigued us. We'll cover the reasons we went with Rust, how we structured our code, and how you can do it too. If you're looking to expand your horizons, Rust may be the language for you."
