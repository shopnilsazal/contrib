recordingDate: 1450200425
description: "In this GDC 2014 talk, veteran level designer Matthias Worch (Unreal 2, Dead Space 2) conducts a provocative talk on why a game is \"a series of interesting decisions\". As he notes: \"What is \"orthogonal unit differentiation\" and why is it important? Meaningful choice is one of the staples of good and compelling game design, but as a concept it is still poorly understood and has rarely been explored in detail. This is especially true for the discipline of level design.\" \nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
