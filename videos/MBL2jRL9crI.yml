description: "RailsConf 2018: Ten Years of Rails Tutorials by Michael Hartl \n\nCome see how Rails has evolved over the years through the lens of introductory Rails tutorials. Marvel at Rails pre-REST, survive the merger with Merb, feel the joy & pain of the then-new asset pipeline, and watch testing techniques grow, evolve, and simplify. Leave with a deeper appreciation for where Rails came from and where it is today."
