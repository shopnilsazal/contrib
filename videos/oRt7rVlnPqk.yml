title: 'RubyConf 2014 - It''s so quiet. Let''s make music. by Loren Segal'
recordingDate: 1417795996
description: "Ruby is used for a lot of things, but for some reason, only a few people are using it for music. In a language that is meant to make programming fun, the lack of such creative code is scary. Let's fix the current landscape by learning how to use the tools available in Ruby (and some not) to let those creative juices flow. We will be focusing on how to build sounds from the ground up (the powerful amplitude, and the majestic waveform), so you don't need any prior audio wizardry. Just bring yourself and a Ruby console and we just might create some beautiful music in a beautiful language.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FkBN/"
