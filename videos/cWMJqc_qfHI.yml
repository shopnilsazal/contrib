title: '[DevFest Nantes 2014] JHipster, a Yeoman generator for AngularJS and Spring Boot'
recordingDate: 1417093404
description: "JHipster is an application generator that creates a modern JavaScript application (with AngularJS, Grunt, Bower...) that works seamlessly with a more classical Java back-end (with Spring Boot, Spring Data, Hibernate, Maven). With more 800 Github stars, 50 contributors, and articles on Infoworld and SDTimes, JHipster has become in less than a year the most widely used Spring application generator, and the #3 Yeoman generator. \nIn this session, we will show how to quickly create an application, modify it, work with hot reloading of both JavaScript and Java code, and deploy everything to the cloud. There will be live coding.\n\nPr√©sentation par Julien Dubois"
