description: "Lightning Talk - Netflix OSS on Kubernetes - Christian Posta, Red Hat\n\nSome popular Netflix OSS components were created at a time when nothing better existed. Kubernetes bakes a lot of these concepts into the platform so that developers can simplify their applications regardless of language choice and still take advantage of things like service discovery, failover, loadbalancing, configuration, etc. So does Netflix OSS still have a place?\n\nAbout Christian Posta\nChristian Posta (@christianposta) is a Principal Middleware Specialist/Architect at Red Hat and well known for being an author (Microservices for Java Developers, Oâ€™Reilly 2016), frequent blogger, speaker, open-source enthusiast and committer on Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Camel, Fabric8 and others. Christian has spent time at web-scale companies and now helps companies creating and deploying large-scale distributed architectures - many of what are now called Microservices based. He enjoys mentoring, training and leading teams to be successful with distributed systems concepts, microservices, devops, and cloud-native application design."
