description: "Dockerized Development Environments\nNot Just for Production\n\nDocker has been widely touted as a game changer for running code in production. People have been quick to praise it's novel approach to packaging system dependencies and code together, making replicable environments between machines a trivial task.\n\nThis same replicable nature and approach to managing systems dependencies make this tool indispensable on a Developer's local machine.\n\nThe Impact of Containers on Development Environments\nDevelopment environments can make the daily life of a Developer heaven or hell and directly influence the productivity of the whole team unit. An unobtrusive environment that allows Developers to choose the tools they like to use is a pleasure to work with. When you combine this with a simple provisioning solution that gets your new hires up and running fast, you're letting people focus on the code first.\n\nConcrete Examples\nI've had the pleasure of working on some fantastic Development teams during the course of my career, and I'd like to walk you through a fictional Django project, that leverages containers to implement many of the efficiencies these teams enjoyed.\n\nPresentation page -- https://2017.pycon.ca/schedule/62/"
