description: "Vault and Secret Management in Kubernetes [I] - Armon Dadgar, HashiCorp\n\nSecret data is everywhere, from database credentials, TLS certificates, API tokens, to encryption keys. Manageing secrets is a difficult challenge, but HashiCorp Vault provides an answer. In this talk, we discuss the challenges in secret management, provide an overview of Vault, and discuss how Vault and Kubernetes can be integrated. Integrating Vault solves the basic secret management challenge of securely distributing credentials, but also gives applications running Kubernetes access to features like dynamic secrets which are generated on demand and cryptographic offload to securely manage data in transit and at rest.\n\nAbout Armon Dadgar\nTwitter Tweet LinkedIn Connect  Websitehttps://hashicorp.com\nArmon (@armon) has a passion for distributed systems and their application to real-world problems. He is a founder and CTO of HashiCorp, where he brings distributed systems into the world of DevOps tooling. He has worked on Nomad, Vault, Terraform, Consul, and Serf at HashiCorp, and maintains the Statsite and Bloomd OSS projects as well."
