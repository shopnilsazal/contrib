title: 'Building a Real World, End User, Open Source Application in Clojure - Moritz Heidkamp, Moritz Ulrich'
recordingDate: 1435946210
description: "In the last few months we've implemented and open sourced the document management system Pepa.\n\nIn this presentation we'd like to showcase how such an end-user facing application can be built using the great open source libraries the Clojure ecosystem has to offer, e.g. Liberator, Stuart Sierra's Component, core.async, Transit, and Om.\n\nWe'll discuss how we implemented a push-enabled web interface, background workers, configuration, authorization, and several more aspects of a real-world application on this technology stack."
