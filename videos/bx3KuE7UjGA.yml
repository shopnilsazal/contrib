MINIX 3 is the third major version of MINIX and is now focused on very high-reliability and security. When you buy a TV set, you just plug it in and it works perfectly for the next 10 year. We are trying to make operating systems as good as that. The current version of MINIX 3 can detect device driver crashes and some server crashes and automatically replace the failed component without user intervention and without affecting running processes. The talk will discuss these aspects as well as new work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
