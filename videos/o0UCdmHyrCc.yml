The Jury        What is special about it?        Arne Babenhauserheide        It does away with ceremony        by following the format used        to write for human actors        without sacrificing        any of the power of writing        in a real programming language.        The Jury        Did you not hint at a prototype        of such a system at FOSDEM 2016?        Arne Babenhauserheide        Yes, and now it works well!    \n\n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:00:00"
