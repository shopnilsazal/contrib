description: "Keynote: Cloud Native Architectures with an Open Source, Event Driven, Serverless Platform - Daniel Krook, Senior Software Engineer, IBM\n\nNew cloud programming models enabled by serverless architectures are emerging, allowing developers to focus more sharply on creating their applications and less on managing their infrastructure. The OpenWhisk project started by IBM provides an open source platform to enable these cloud native, event driven applications.\n\nAbout Daniel Krook works with customers and the community to create first of a kind cloud solutions based on the OpenStack, Cloud Foundry, Docker, and OpenWhisk open source projects. Most recently he has been building bots and IoT prototypes backed by serverless, event-driven cloud architectures."
