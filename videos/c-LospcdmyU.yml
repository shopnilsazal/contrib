description: "Learn how to optimize your development flow by leveraging the type-safe, functional-first, SAFE Stack. Make your applications SAFE with Suave (or Giraffe/Saturn), Azure, Fable, and Elmish. The Suave/Fable combination provides shared code between server and client respectively, with automatic server/client updates whenever a file is updated. Elmish provides a client-side model-view-update architecture as made famous by Elm. The SAFE Stack's build tooling generates docker images that can be hosted in Azure, providing a simple, built-in continuous deployment experience. After this talk you'll know everything you need to maximize your productivity while providing SAFE web applications to your users.\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree"
