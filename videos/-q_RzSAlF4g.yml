title: '#HITB2016AMS CommSec Track D1 - Pentesting Chatops - Melanie Rieback'
recordingDate: 1466056475
description: "ChatOps, a concept originating from Github, is chatroom-driven DevOps for distributed teams, using chatbots (like Hubot) to execute custom scripts and plugins. We have applied the concept of ChatOps to the penetration testing workflow, and found that it fits outstandingly – for everything from routine scanning to spearphishing to pentest gamification. This talk discusses the tools that we use (RocketChat, Hubot, Gitlab, pentesting tools), and provides battle stories of using Pentesting ChatOps in practice.\n\n======\n\nMelanie Rieback is the CEO/Co-founder of Radically Open Security, the world’s first non-profit computer security consultancy company.  She is also a former Assistant Professor of Computer Science at VU who performed RFID security research (RFID Virus and RFID Guardian), that attracted worldwide press coverage, and won several awards (VU Mediakomeet, ISOC Award, NWO I/O award, IEEE Percom Best Paper, USENIX Lisa Best Paper). Melanie also worked as a Senior Engineering Manager on XenClient at Citrix, where she led the Citrix Vancouver office. She was also a Senior Managing Consultant in the Cyber Crime Expertise and Response Team (CCERT) at ING Bank, where she set up the CCERT Analysis Lab and was the lead technical project manager of the ING Core Threat Intelligence Systems. For fun, she founded the Dutch Girl Geek Dinner in 2008.
