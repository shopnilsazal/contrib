description: "PyData SV 2014 \nI will describe data science efforts at Berkeley, with a particular focus on teaching and the new Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS), funded by the Moore and Sloan Foundations. BIDS will be a space for the open and interdisciplinary work that is typical of the SciPy community. In the creation of BIDS, open source scientific tools for data science, and specifically the SciPy ecosystem, played an important role."
