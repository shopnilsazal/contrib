description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2017 by Jeroen Mols, Philips Hue.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-5\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/jeroenmols/the-art-of-organizing-resources\n\nDo you remember the last time you had to dig into strings.xml to find the right String to use? Or that you manually had to go over all drawables to find the one you needed?\n\nWhenever we start a new project, we take a lot of care in setting up our architecture, CI, build flavors,â€¦ But do you also have a strategy to name your resources?\n\nYou should! Because the lack of XML namespaces, makes managing Android resources tedious. And causes things to grow out of control easily, especially in large projects.\n\nSo let's introduce a simple scheme that will solve your pains: - easy lookup of any resource (autocomplete) - logical, predictable names - clean ordering of resources - strongly typed resources\n\nThis talk will explain the mechanism, its advantages, limitations and provide an easy to use cheat sheet.\n\nType: Android development\nExperience: beginner\n\nAlex Karp Production"
