title: 'Ghost in the Machine - Bridging VR and IoT by Etienne Caron, Shopify EN'
recordingDate: 1529097144
description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Etienne Caron, Shopify.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-6\n\nIn this session, we'll bridge the real and the virtual. We'll first see how to build a simple Android Things powered robot with off-the-shelf parts. Then we'll build a VR remote control app, using Google's Daydream SDK.\n\nSamples shown in this session are written in Kotlin. Some familiarity with OpenGL is helpful, but not required.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
