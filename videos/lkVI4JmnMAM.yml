description: "by Justin Campbell\nWe all love Ruby. Maybe we’ve only been paid to write code in Ruby (and maybe JavaScript). But there are so many other languages out there, and they all have strengths, weaknesses, and very different communities surrounding them.\nLet’s talk about language exploration. We’ll discuss how to learn a new language, considerations when introducing things to production, and come up with some ideas for Ruby and it’s ecosystem. Plan on dipping your toes in Elixir, Go, Haskell, Rust, and Scala during the session.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GWIb/"
