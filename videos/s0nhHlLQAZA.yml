description: "Lucky 225, Phreaking in the Age of Voice Over IP\nPhreaking in the age of Voice Over IP? What the hell is Voice Over IP? If you're asking this question and you'reinterested in phones and thought phreaking was dead back in the early \"80s when blueboxing died, or 2002 when ATandT killed redboxing on long distance calls then this is the speech for you. Or if you know what VoIP is but want to know how the hell it has any impact on phreaking you should also attend. \n\nThis talk intends to educate it's audience on the new age phreakers. Most of the discussion will involve a detailed explanation of Calling Party Number(CPN), ANI, and Caller ID, and the differences between all three, we will also be covering the basics of phreaking with Voice Over IP technology, Asterisk, and VXML.\n\nNot all of this presentation will be dealing with VoIP, this is a basic new age phreaking presentation that will show the latest techniques that phreaks are using today it's not just about free calls either, hell you get that with VoIP anyways! You will learn not only why VoIP is important, but such things as Spoofing Caller ID(and no we don\"t mean orangeboxing, Social Engineering Telus, our methods are simple to use and will cost as little as $15/month)\n\nAs technology is rapidly changing, so is our phone system. We will be discussing a basic over view of Voice Over IP and some of the services provided by many of these so-called \"Broadband phone companies.\" We will also be discussing Calling Cards that use VOIP technology to provide cheaper rates to their customers. We intend to explain how VoIP is changing the phone system and making it very easy for the every day consumer to spoof Caller ID by spoofing Calling Party Number(CPN), and how this can be exploited to circumvent security in such things as Voicemail, Credit Card Activations, and even Telephone company numbers that when you call from your \"own phone\" will give you complete control over your dial-tone telephone line. We also plan on showing how easy it is to get around services like \"Call Intercept\" without even spoofing Caller ID. We will also be discussing why *67 and Complete Caller ID block features offered from the phone company are not adequate privacy protection as anyone can still get your phone number when you call them with your number blocked, we\"ll of course describe how this can be possible. As time permits there may very well be much more, you wont want to miss this presentation.\n\nLucky225 is the co-host of an internet streaming radio show \"Default Radio\" that streams on Rant Radio a free non-profit shoutcast server that has been running for 6 years). He has been a writer for 2600 magazine since 1999 and has spoken at both H2K2 and Defcon 11. He has been an avid phone phreak since his early teens in High School and has much experience with the telephone system and a wide variety of knowledge ranging from regular telephones, payphones, cell phones, and voicemail systems to ANI, Caller ID, PBX's, switches, VoIP and much more.\n\nStrom Carlson is one of the last true phone phreaks; he has an intense interest in the structure and history of the telephone network and an intense distaste for fraud, theft, and vandalism. He collects all things related to telephony (including recordings), and although he is rapidly running out of space in which to store his many cubic meters of telephone equipment, he will eagerly and compulsively snap up anything made or published by Western Electric if given the chance. He encourages all phone phreaks and interested parties to learn what they\"re really talking about; he also encourages you to listen to everything on http://www.phonetrips.com/ and to poke around http://www.stromcarlson.com/"
