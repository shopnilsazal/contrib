description: "In a world that is changing at an unprecedented speed the brands are struggling to keep pace with changing customer habits.\n\nThe statistics show that not only consumers are always connected, but also that smartphones are increasingly used even while shopping and apps are widely preferred over access via web browser. In short, the revolution is underway but most companies hesitate, risking the loss of opportunities in an environment where you do not need to reach the widest possible audience, but the potential buyers, when they have reasons for interest in your offer and with the right messages.\n\nIn this talk we will show a survey conducted by MobileBridge and recent data showing how to engage customers through various touchpoints and how this can positively affect economic performance, using some real cases as examples."
