recordingDate: 1412693928
description: "By, Blithe Rocher\nFor software engineers, troubleshooting is one of the toughest and most important skills to develop. When problems arise, a beginning developer's first instincts are to panic and head to StackOverflow. Rather than quick fixes, it's important to seek a deeper understanding of what went wrong.\n\nBiologists, chemists, and physicists increase understanding about the world by applying the logical steps of the scientific method to discover solutions to complex problems. Like scientists, developers can learn troubleshooting skills by treating each problem like a mini \"science\" experiment.\n\nIn this talk we'll explore how using the scientific method can lead to greater understanding and more viable solutions to complex problems.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FV3e/"
