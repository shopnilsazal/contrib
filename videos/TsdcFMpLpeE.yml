description: "Near real-time Updates for Cooccurrence-based Recommenders\n\nMost recommendation algorithms are inherently batch oriented and require all relevant history to be processed. In some contexts such as music, this does not cause significant problems because waiting a day or three before recommendations are available for new items doesnâ€™t significantly change their impact. In other contexts, the value of items drops precipitously with time so that recommending day-old items has little value to users.\n\nIn this talk, I will describe how a large-scale multi-modal cooccurrence recommender can be extended to include near real-time updates. In addition, I will show how these real-time updates are compatible with delivery of recommendations via search engines."
