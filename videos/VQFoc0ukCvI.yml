description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nAutoscale your Kubernetes Workload with Prometheus - Frederic Branczyk, CoreOS (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nTime to autoscale your cloud native deployments, but how do you make it happen? In the past, easier said than done. Lack of guidance and inconsistent implementations of solutions have made autoscaling on Kubernetes a pain. Tedious extensibility and difficult maintenance with Heapster were some of the causes for this. Those days are over! At Kubernetes sig-instrumentation, we have developed and standardised the resource and custom metrics APIs. These APIs are finally giving Kubernetes the autoscaling capabilities it so desperately needed. Frederic Branczyk, software engineer at CoreOS, will explain the history of autoscaling on Kubernetes, elaborate on the design and usage of these newly developed APIs, and describe how they benefit the consistency of autoscaling. He will talk about the recommended way to autoscale Kubernetes using Prometheus, and end with a demo showcasing just that.\n\nAbout Frederic\nFrederic is an engineer at CoreOS contributing to Prometheus and Kubernetes to build state of the art modern infrastructure and monitoring tools. He discovered his interest in monitoring tools and distributed systems in his previous jobs, where he used machine learning to detect anomalies indicating intrusion attempts. He also worked on projects involving secrets management for distributed applications to build sane and stable infrastructure."
