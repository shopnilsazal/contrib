description: "Mage2 - Electronic Weaponry or How to Rule the World While Shopping at Radio Shack\nThese days, all hackers have jobs and make some type of money. No matter if you are an independent researcher/ consultant/ 1337 hacker/ or entrepreneur, sometimes you have to deal with the corporate crap, one way or another. Now, how about those who really have to deal with it on a daily-basis in the corporate world? Well, this is an updated version of my DEF CON15 talk, shorter in time, yet, heavier on rants. Years go by, and most companies still don't understand their employees, and or keep the old style management. On the flip side, the new generation of hackers are getting into good companies, making good money, and some think they reached the peak of their career.\nWhat's up?\nWe like to blame the companies and bosses, but, how about our own faults and mistakes? You might be part of the problem, not the solution. And those stupid rules you have to follow, might exist because of your actions.\n\nIt's easy and common to say your boss is a douchebag, but what happens when YOU become the boss and have to manage the newer (and old) generation? Is it that easy? In addition to just covering the corporate bullshit, I am gonna touch on how some of the cultural differences around the world and try to help the hacker community or the companies to better understand each other.\n\nLuiz \"effffn\" Eduardo is a security consultant, researcher and hacker who's been around the corporate world around the globe for almost 20 years.\n\nHe's somewhat known in the hacker community for helping with the wireless networks at your favorite security cons and is the founder and one of the organizers of the YSTS security conference in Brazil.\n\nThroughout his career Luiz has worked with possibly all types of networking technologies on the enterprise and service provider sectors, as well the security around these technologies and also has been a speaker at security events around the globe including: DefCon, ShmooCon, LayerOne, Toorcon, H2HC, HitB Malaysia and others. You can follow Luiz on Twitter as well.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
