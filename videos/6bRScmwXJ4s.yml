description: "Joshua Marpet - Facial Recognition: Facts, Fiction; and Fcsk-Ups!\nFacial Recognition sucks. But it's getting better. Big brother is watching, and he is interested in what you do, where you go, and who you talk to. Whether it's Deep Packet Inspection, or Facial Recognition, the idea of personalization as applied to privacy invasion is a fascinating and cogent issue.\n\nGovernments are using it to locate fugitives with fake id's in the DMV database. DHS-like agencies, the world over, are starting to use it to find terrorists flying in or out of their country. Police departments can identify criminals from street side video surveillance cameras. When will you be added to a list? And what ramifications will that have on your life?\n\nLearn how good Facial Recognition is, common ways to defeat it, and where the science of Finding Waldo in a crowd is going.\n\nJoshua Marpet is a Security Solutions Specialist at WhiteHat Security, providing strategic guidance to WhiteHat customers and prospects on their website risk management programs. Additionally, he strives to educate the market-at-large about the need for effective website security.\n\nMr. Marpet is a popular speaker at industry events including Black Hat and Bsides, and has served as an adjunct professor of computer science at St. Johns University's Tobin College of Business. He is currently writing a textbook about Physical Security in a Networked World.\n\nPrior to WhiteHat, Joshua worked as an information security consultant focused on penetration testing, auditing and forensics. Early in his career, he worked in law enforcement. He was later able to combine those skills with his interest in technology to create security systems for the airline, gaming, and prison industries. Mr. Marpet earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Fairleigh Dickinson University.\n\nHis industry certifications include C|EH (Certified Ethical Hacker), from ISC(2), as well as the ever popular Application Security Specialist.\n\nTwitter: @quadlingdageek\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
