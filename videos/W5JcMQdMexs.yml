title: 'Introduction to webpack - Chris Klug'
recordingDate: 1529905431
description: "As our web development code moves further and further towards the front-end, with the browser becoming a host for running complex programs, and not just show information, the need for managing our front-end resources becomes bigger...and harder. There are several ways to do this, but currently it seems as though webpack is the way that people are gravitating towards. \nUnfortunately, getting started with webpack offers a bit of a hurdle to get over. Webpack configurations can look fairly complicated, and getting started can seem like a daunting task! But with large JavaScript frameworks like Angular and Aurelia buying into it, we developers do not have much choice. We have to understand it!\n\nIn this session, you will get a basic introduction to how webpack works, the concepts behind it, and how to get started playing around with it. The topic is too big to make you an expert in an hour, but hopefully you will walk out understanding concepts well enough to both start configuring your own bundles, as well as be able to understand most of the stuff you see in the more complicated bundle configurations you will run across."
