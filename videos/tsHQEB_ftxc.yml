description: 'Shortly after Adelbert Chang entered college as a computer science major, he contemplated changing his major several times, usually in the direction of physics and mathematics. That all changed when he was introduced to functional programming â€” at once both mysterious and beautiful. In this talk, Adelbert will elaborate on his early perspectives on computer science, math, and physics, and discuss how he ended up so enamored with functional programming.'
