description: "Building a Bank with Kubernetes - Oliver Beattie, Monzo\n\n\"In this talk Oliver Beattie, Head of Engineering at European startup bank Monzo, explores how they are building a micro-services core banking platform, and how Kubernetes enables it all.\n\nIt's a new kind of bank – unshackled from beastly, complex legacy systems – one that belongs in the 21st century, and one with the best technology in the world. Topics covered include:\n\n* Architecting applications with extreme performance and consistency requirements\n* RPC at scale between thousands of services in a container environment (discovery, load balancing, fault-tolerance, and observability)\n* Managing resources across physical data centres and multiple cloud providers\n* How Kubernetes is particularly well-suited to building very secure applications\"\n\nAbout Oliver Beattie\nOliver Beattie is Head of Engineering at Monzo, leading the development of the distributed systems to power a new kind of bank. He previously worked on Hailo's global micro-services platform. Find his first-person musings on Twitter @obeattie."
