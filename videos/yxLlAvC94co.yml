description: "In 2005 Linus Torvalds—creator of Linux kernel—started searching for a version control system (VCS) that he could use for managing Linux' source code. Being unsatisfied with available systems, he set out to create his own that could help him efficiently do his job.\n\nFast forward to 2017: Microsoft is finishing transitioning of their Windows' source code to git—arguably the most popular version control system on the planet.\n\nHowever—according to my observations—git is often misused. Even some \"senior\" developers know only basics: commit, push, and pull.\n\nIn this talk I will give you some intuitions about git that will help you while working with it. I shall start with describing why git works the way it does. Having shown you basics, I will discuss the tradeoffs of some of the work models that people adopt. Finally, I will show you some of the superpowers of git."
