recordingDate: 1425914711
description: "BY: STEVE TREVATHAN\n\nEmber allows us to design highly adaptive, extendable, and fast web apps, but with those possibilities comes greater responsibility. Successfully leveraging the characteristics that make the technology worth while requires a myriad of methods, principles, and patterns that aren’t readily obvious to those breaking into single page application design. In this talk I’ll hone in on those requirements with relevant examples and give the audience a starting point to make their next Ember.js product design successful.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GO1K/"
