recordingDate: 1383356929
description: "This presentation is an introduction to the new world of automobile communication, data and entertainment systems, highlighting the Ford Sync System.\n\nThe Ford Sync System is a remarkable technological advance that has changed the automobile industry. While hard drives have been used in automobile entertainment applications for some time now, the Ford Sync System is different. It allows the user to interact with the car's communication system in a brand new way. If a vehicle with the Ford Sync system is used to commit a crime or to hide data, how would examiners be able to determine what data might be contained in the Ford Sync System? How does it get there? What forensic process or type of exploitation can be used to determine what traces are left behind on the car's hard drive? This presentation will take the audience through the process of various methods of infilling, hiding, acquiring data, and conducting a forensic exam on the Ford Sync System.\n\nTyler Cohen is known in the digital forensic community for her work with forensics on alternate media devices and has given presentations at conferences all over the country on the topic, including the Defense Cybercrime Conference, High Tech Crime Investigation Association, Defcon, TechnoSecuity, Technoforensics, and the California District Attorney Association.
