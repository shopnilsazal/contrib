description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nFollowing the 'Applying functional programming in code design' session from Wednesday, I'd like to conduct a 'crash course' on functors and monads, and why they are important - and useful - regardless of the language you are writing code in.\n— \nComputer Science student at Faculty of Electronics at Wrocław University of Technology. Loves metaprogramming and doing as much as possible during compile time, instead of wasting precious cycles at runtime. \n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
