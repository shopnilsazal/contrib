description: "LOOK MUM, NO HANDS!\n\nA typical interaction with a device or interface involves touching it. Either you’re pressing buttons on a controller, swiping on a touchscreen or clicking on your laptop’s trackpad. But what if you could control things without the use of your hands? What if you could use… your thoughts?\n\nCHARLIE GERARD\n\nI come from a marketing background and changed career a couple of years ago to become a developer. I started my dev career as a Software Developer and consultant @ ThoughtWorks in Sydney, working on various types of projects from small websites for startups to complex software for big corporations. I quickly developed a great interest in tinkering with hardware, cutting edge technologies and creative coding. Therefore, I have spent a lot of my personal time over the past few years prototyping projects to mix technology, design and art. \n\nI also contribute to the community by writing tutorials about my experiments and by giving talks at meetups and coding bootcamps to share my passion for creative technologies and hopefully motivate developers to explore that space. I recently moved to London in the hope of being part of more innovative projects."
