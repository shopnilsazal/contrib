description: "Schemas for the Real World by: Carina C. Zona\n\nApp development, especially for social, challenges us to evaluate how to code for the complexity of modern life. Examples include the growing range of labels people ascribe to their important relationships, sexual orientation, and gender. Users are giving push-back to questions that carry ill-fitted assumptions or constrain their responses.\n\nFacebook, Google+, and developers in many other industries are grappling with these issues. The most resilient approaches will arise from an app's own foundations. We'll look at schemas' influence on product scope, UX, and analytics. Then we'll check out a range of approaches for bringing modern realities into any app's schema, views, and logic."
