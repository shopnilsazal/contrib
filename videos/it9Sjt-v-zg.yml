Every day, we all trust millions of people, organizations, and systems — and we do it so easily that we barely notice.  But in any system of trust, there is an alternative, parasitic, strategy that involves abusing that trust.  Making sure those defectors don't destroy the very cooperative systems they're abusing is an age-old problem, and we've developed a variety of societal pressures to induce cooperation: moral systems, reputational systems, institutional systems, and security systems. Understanding how these different societal pressures work — and fail — is essential to understanding the problems we face in today's increasingly technological and interconnected world.\n\nABOUT BRUCE SCHNEIER\n\nBruce Schneier is an internationally renowned security technologist, referred to by The Economist as a \"security guru.\"  He is the author of eleven books — including the best sellers Liars and Outliers, Beyond Fear, and Secrets and Lies -- as well as hundreds of articles and essays, and many more academic papers.  His influential newsletter \"Crypto-Gram,\" and his blog \"Schneier on Security,\" are read by over 250,000 people.  He has testified before Congress, is a frequent guest on television and radio, served on several government technical committees, and is regularly quoted in the press.  Schneier is the Chief Security Technology Officer of BT."
