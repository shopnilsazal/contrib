recordingDate: 1435934844
description: "Build Better Desktop Apps with Ember by Estelle DeBlois\n\nEmber.js describes itself as a framework for creating ambitious web applications. But “ambitious” doesn’t have to stop at the boundaries of the web world.\nProjects such as NW.js have shown that it was possible to write cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies. NW.js goes even further, letting you interact with Node modules directly in the browser. But here’s the catch: without proper guards and good code organization, issues can arise quickly, leaving you fighting your way through an environment where Node and browser contexts don’t always play well together.\nIn this talk, we will explore some of the challenges you may face, and how you can overcome them with simple tools and techniques. You don’t have to look very far for answers. Ember and Ember CLI provide just the right hooks to make desktop applications a breeze to develop and test."
