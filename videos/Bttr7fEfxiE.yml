recordingDate: 1391474512
description: "Zac Franken: Biometric and token based access control systems: Are you protected by two screws and a plastic cover?\n\nAn overview and demonstration of common access control and biometric systems. This will include the key elements of their implementation and includes in-depth technical analysis of their common weakness. I will then demonstrate bespoke hardware developed to perform an attack that renders most access control systems useless.\n\nZac Franken has been running operations for Defcon for nearly 14 years. Generally preferring to stay behind the scenes, he finally has allowed himself to be talked into a presentation. When not running Defcon operations or attending security conferences, he skulks in his dormant volcano lair .With a penchant for physical security and access control systems, he noodles around with access control systems, designs workarounds, and weeps at the inadequacy of todays access control technology."
