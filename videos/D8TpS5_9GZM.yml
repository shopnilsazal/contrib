description: "Everyone acknowledges that the software field has an issue with gender\nbalance, but there are many of arguments about what to do about it.\nRecent events have caused the community to scrutinize how they treat\nthe issues of race and gender. The social justice community uses the\nterm 'anti-oppression' to describe techniques for being more inclusive\nto people of a wide variety of backgrounds, ethnicities, sexualities,\nand genders. Software developers generally lack exposure to these\nterms and techniques.\n\nIn this talk, Lindsey and Steve will introduce basic anti-oppression\nconcepts, and provide specific examples of situations where we as\nsoftware developers can use these tools to engender a more inclusive\ncommunity."
