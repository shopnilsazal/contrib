description: "In this 2016 GDC talk, Loveshack's Joshua Boggs offers a blunt and punchy look at the strategies and ideas FRAMED used to position itself as a must-have premium title at launch on iOS. Boggs then discusses how this pre-release acclaim actually turned out for FRAMED, and how a weak launch was turned around without a single update.\n\nRegister for GDC: http://ubm.io/2gk5KTU\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
