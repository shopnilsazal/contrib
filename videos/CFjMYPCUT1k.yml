description: "Jos Weyers - Key Impressioning\nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-19/dc-19-presentations/Weyers/DEFCON-19-Weyers-Key-Impressioning.pdf\n\nWe've all seen lockpicking explained on several security venues. You might even have tried it yourself. But what if you need to open a lock a number of times? Wouldn't it be great to have an opening technique that would supply you with a working key in the process? A method to do this has existed for quite some time, but until recently it has remained quite unknown. Some time ago impressioning locks got \"re-invented\" by the lockpick community and the skill evolved to the level now shown at several international championships. What is it? How does it work? What skill is involved? Why is it the most interesting way to open a lock? These questions, and more will be answered in this talk.\n\nJos Weyers After ending second in the ongoing toool.nl competition four times in a row, he decided to do some training. 300-400 blanks later he slashed the then world record time of 4 minutes and 23 seconds to impression an ABUS C83 - he did it in 87 seconds! He's the current Dutch champion (second time in a row), the current German Meister (that's champion :-)) and current world record holder in this particular lock opening technique. Most people know him as the Dutch Kilt guy."
