description: "From the 2014 Velocity Conference in New York City, Mikey Dickerson's keynote: \"One Year After healthcare.gov: Where Are We Now?\"\n\nhealthcare.gov, possibly the most closely watched government IT project of all time, launched to intense media scrutiny on October 1, 2013…and spectacularly fell on its face. The next six months would be a watershed in the federal government, as a trillion-dollar agency came to grips with the fact that there was no product to buy, and no check they could write, to deliver a working website. Yet the site did eventually become functional, helped by what Time Magazine described as “a team of unknown coders and troubleshooters who dropped what they were doing in various enterprises across the country and came together in mid-October.”\n\nAs best as we can in 25 minutes, we’ll catch you up on the legacy of healthcare.gov, the current state of the art in federal government technology, what has become of those formerly-unknown engineers, and what these all have to do with each other.\n\nAbout Mikey Dickerson (Federal Government | United States Digital Services Team):\nMikey Dickerson worked in Site Reliability Engineering at Google from 2006 to 2014, modulo side trips to work on the Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012. In 2013 he took one more leave of absence to join what became known as the “ad hoc” team that rescued healthcare.gov after its disastrous launch on October 1. He has been on a baffling through-the-looking-glass adventure ever since, including a move in August 2014 to become the Administrator of the newly created United States Digital Service.\n\nWatch more from the 2014 Velocity New York Conference: http://goo.gl/kmrqJF\nFind out more about Velocity: http://velocityconf.com/\n\nDon't miss an upload!
