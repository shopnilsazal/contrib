description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Ryan Cooke, Pinterest.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-71\n\nWe are now operating in a data-driven world. If your company isn't using metrics to determine what their next step is, then your company is likely moving blindly. That is fairly universally accepted, but what's worse is when what your metrics tell you isn't true. It is very easy for a metric logging error to complete invalidate your conclusion. This talk discusses what we at Pinterest do to avoid this.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
