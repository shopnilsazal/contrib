recordingDate: 1384990850
description: "Doppelganger: The Web's Evil Twin\nEdward Zaborowski Senior Security Engineer, Apptis\n\nUsers and administrators alike surf the web assuming that, for the most part, what they are looking at is what the website served to their browser; however, an attacker can deploy a malicious proxy, altering responses and requests, as well as potentially stealing sensitive data, all without a user being aware.\n\nIn this presentation I will discuss some of the attacks that a hacker can use when deploying a malicious proxy. Additionally, I will discuss Doppelganger, a tool that I've written to expedite some of the discussed techniques, its current capabilities, future additions, and more.\n\nEdward Zaborowski started working in the computer security field when he enlisted in the US Air Force. During his enlistment he had the opportunity to help provide a wide array of security services such as intrusion detection, penetration testing, and incident response. He separated from the USAF in 2001 to continue his career in computer security and is currently working as a senior security engineer for Apptis based in Chantilly, VA.\n\nWhen not he's not delving into security, he also enjoys as hobbies programming and video games (or programming video games) and can usually be found pwning or being pwned -- usually the latter -- in Call of Duty or DotA.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
