description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2017 by Florian Mierzejewski, Novoda.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-10\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/florianmski/taking-care-of-your-ui-tests\n\nMost Android UI testing talks focus on how Espresso works and how to start writing simple tests. This is fine for a simple app but maintaining and expanding those tests gets harder as the app grows.\nThis talk will focus on writing complex tests scenarios while making sure we keep them maintenable, extandable and readable. Iâ€™ll use a released app we developed as an example. This will involve multi-screen scenarios, handling asynchronous operations, providing a fake environment as well as some common and less common Espresso gotchas.\n\nType: Android development\nExperience: expert\n\n Alex Karp Production"
