recordingDate: 1400458563
description: "Camlistore is your personal storage system for life. It's one of the oldest large Go programs, developed in concert with the Go standard library from June 2010 until present, and has had many gophers hack on it. It's seen and helped shaped the standard library from before r56 to r60, to Go 1 (the first stable release in March 2012), 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. Hear about Camlistore's goals, see it in action, see fun code, and hear some of the Go standard library history.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0f/"
