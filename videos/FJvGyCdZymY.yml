description: "Scripts that Scale with F# and mbrace.io:\nNothing beats interactive scripting for productive data exploration and rapid prototyping: grab data, run code, and iterate based on feedback. However, that story starts to break down once you need to process large datasets or expensive computations. Your local machine becomes the bottleneck, and your are left with a slow and unresponsive environment.\n\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate on live examples how you can have your cake and eat it, too, using mbrace.io, a free, open-source engine for scalable cloud programming. Using a simple programming model, you can keep working from your favorite scripting environment, and execute code interactively against a cluster on the Azure cloud. We will discuss the relevance of F# and mbrace in a data science and machine learning context, from parallelizing code and data processing in a functional style, to leveraging F# type providers to consume data or even run R packages."
