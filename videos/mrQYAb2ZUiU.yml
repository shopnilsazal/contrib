title: 'Using Ruby to Craft and Test Beautiful Command Line Applications by Nikhil Mungel and Shishir Das'
recordingDate: 1337019058
description: "In any *nix system, the command line is the standard method of reliably interacting with the system. We are used to the exhaustive, fast and predictable nature of core-utils as well as the shell itself.\n\nYet most user-space CLI tools leave much to be desired in terms of the user experience design and playing nicely with other CLI tools.\n\nRuby's powerful abilities of dealing with textual data as well as its ability to directly interface with POSIX libraries and the underlying system itself makes it a great candidate for writing CLI apps.\n\nDrawing from our experiences, we will discuss -- how to model CLI apps in Ruby; how to test CLI apps; standards to follow while accepting commands, arguments and options; making CLI apps fit nicely into the *nix ecosystem; and delighting users with self-documented, easy-to-use, powerful CLI apps."
