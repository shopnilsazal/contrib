description: "Kubernetes at DigitalOcean: Building a Platform for the Future [B] - Joonas Bergius, DigitalOcean\n\nLike in much of our industry today, DigitalOcean has been on a journey to evolve its monolithic architecture of the early days towards one made up of cloud-native micro services. This talk will provide an overview our journey from where we started to what our motivations were, share what we built and provide you with lessons we learned along the way.\n\nYou can expect to take away examples and ideas of how you can make Kubernetes your own as the platform for the future reinforced by concrete examples of exactly how and what we have done at DigitalOcean.\n\nAbout Joonas Bergius\nJoonas Bergius is an Engineering Manager at DigitalOcean, where he has been working with Kubernetes since late 2015 to build a runtime platform for the engineering teams at DigitalOcean."
