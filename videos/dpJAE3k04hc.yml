description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nFrom Data Centers to Cloud Native - Dave Zolotusky & James Wen, Spotify (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nSpotify’s infrastructure is undergoing a drastic transformation from data centers running a large amount of proprietary services to public cloud hosted, cloud native services. Two years ago, all of Spotify’s services ran on on our own hardware. Today, they are running in Google Cloud Platform, and Spotify is in the process of replacing many of the proprietary systems with cloud native solutions like kubernetes, gRPC, and istio. James and Dave will talk about the work that went into moving services into GCP and how Spotify got to where it is today. They will then cover ongoing work and plans to modernize the service infrastructure and migrate to cloud native services. This includes running service in kubernetes on GKE, migrating from a proprietary messaging stack to gRPC, as well as integrating the new infrastructure with existing service discovery and monitoring systems.\n\nAbout Dave\nDave Zolotusky is a software engineer on Spotify's Infrastructure and Operations team in Stockholm, Sweden. His team builds and maintains the core platform that the rest of Spotify runs on. Before joining Spotify, Dave worked at Amazon Web Services, VMware, and Microsoft.\n\nAbout James\nJames Wen is a Site Reliability Engineer at Spotify. He's currently on a Spotify task force focused on revamping Spotify's infrastructure and adopting Kubernetes and co. Prior, James was the Team Lead (Anchor) of the Cloud Foundry Buildpacks team at Pivotal and a core contributor and maintainer of Bundler. James has previously spoken about buildpacks at Cloud Foundry Summit Europe and Spotify's infrastructure journey at QCon New York. In his free time, he absolutely loves climbing, whether it's on gorgeous Fontainebleau slopers or nasty plastic crimps"
