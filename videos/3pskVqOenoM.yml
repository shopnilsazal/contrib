recordingDate: 1431614137
description: "By, Michel Weksler\nPayments applications typically require a strong audit trail, very predictable failure behavior and strong transactional integrity. In Ruby/Rails, ActiveRecord allows any part of the code to modify anything in the database, failures are often silently ignored, and database transactions are hidden for convenience by default. In this talk I'll explore how to solve those problems and use RoR to build a large scale payments system."
