description: "Providing Containerized Cinder Services to Baremetal Kubernetes Clusters [I] - John Griffith, NetApp & Huamin Chen, Red Hat\n\nKubernetes deployments running on OpenStack clusters require a full OpenStack: Keystone, Nova, and Cinder services.\n\nThis talk presents a more pervasive and simplified deployment architecture by integrating Containerized standalone Cinder services with baremetal Kubernetes. Cinder services offer many storage features that are still missing in Kubernetes. Cinder is supported by many storage vendors, with over 70 storage drivers in its repository. A Containerized standalone Cinder service makes these features and extensive storage products available to Kubernetes cluster.\n\nKey to this architecture is a Kubernetes volume provisioner that provisions Cinder volumes and transparently converts Cinder volumes to Kubernetes supported storage types, such as iSCSI, Fibre Channel, NFS, or Ceph RBD.\n\nBased on the these technologies, the new architecture enables enterprise customers to deploy Container services in a dedicated cluster and consume advanced storage features.\n\nAbout Huamin Chen\nA passionate system software developer, Huamin Chen contributes to open source projects spanning from A to Z: Apache BigTop, Ceph, fio, Gluster, Kubernetes, Tachyon, and ZFS. Huamin Chen is currently employed by Red Hat.

Primary responsibilities are upstream contributions to cloud related open source technologies. Currently active in Kubernetes Storage SIG, CNCF CSI project and various other communities. \n\nJohn has over fifteen years of engineering experience in both hardware and software engineering. Heâ€™s been an active user and contributor to open source for over a decade. In addition to his technical contributions, John also spends a lot of his time talking to people who are interested in learning about various Cloud technologies as well as gathering feedback from current users."
