title: 'GeeCON Prague 2017: Roman Pickl - Continuous Code Quality with the SonarEcosystem'
recordingDate: 1516816560
description: 'SonarQube is the leading platform for static code analysis and Continuous Code Quality. In this talk we will look into all three lines of defense of the SonarEcosystem and how they can help to find bugs before they enter your codebase (or at least go into production). After this talk, youâ€™ll have a good overview of the SonarEcosystem as well as actionable starting points for increasing your code quality. Furthermore, we will share learnings from using SonarQube for more than 4 years and pointers to additional resources. I first talked about this topic at the local java meetup in vienna and received very favorable feedback.'
