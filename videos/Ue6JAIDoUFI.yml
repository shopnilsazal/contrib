description: "The Cavalry Isn't Coming: Starting the Revolution to Fsck it All! \nNICHOLAS J. PERCOCO SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND HEAD OF SPIDERLABS, TRUSTWAVE \nJOSHUA CORMAN DIRECTOR OF SECURITY INTELLIGENCE, AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES\n\nWe have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that security is now top of mind for the people of planet Earth. The bad news is that their security illiteracy has lead to very dangerous precedents and this is likely just the beginning. The reactionary stances taken by the hacker community has induced burnout and fatigue with many of us watching our own demise. We're here to help us all hit rock bottom in the pursuit of something better. At some point the pain of maintaining inertia will exceed the pain of making changes, so it is time for some uncomfortable experimentation. While it may be overwhelming to think about, this is what we do. We hack systems. Finding flaws in the digital world comes naturally to us. We can and must do the same to the physical world; the media, governments, and lawmakers in order to survive the next decade. Let's get started.\n\nNicholas J. Percoco (@c7five) has more than 16 years of information security experience and leads SpiderLabs at Trustwave. Prior to joining Trustwave, Percoco ran security consulting practices at VeriSign, and Internet Security Systems. As a speaker, he has provided unique insight around security breaches, malware, mobile security and InfoSec trends to public (Black Hat, DEFCON, SecTor, You Sh0t the Sheriff, OWASP) and private audiences (Including DHS, US-CERT, Interpol, United States Secret Service) throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Percoco and his research has been featured by many news organizations including: The Washington Post, eWeek, PC World, CNET, Wired, Network World, Dark Reading, Fox News, USA Today, Forbes, Computerworld, CSO Magazine, CNN, The Times of London, NPR, Gizmodo, Fast Company, Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nJoshua Corman (@joshcorman) is the Director of Security Intelligence for Akamai Technologies and has more than a decade of experience with security and networking software. Most recently he served as Research Director for Enterprise Security at The 451 Group following his time as Principal Security Strategist for IBM Internet Security Systems. Mr. Corman's cross-domain research highlights adversaries, game theory and motivational structures. His analysis cuts across sectors to the core security challenges plaguing the IT industry, and helps to drive evolutionary strategies toward emerging technologies and shifting incentives. Mr. Corman is a candid and highly-coveted speaker with engagements at leading industry events such as RSA, DEFCON, Interop, ISACA, and SANS. As a staunch advocate for CISOs, Corman also serves as a Fellow with the Ponemon Institute, on the Faculty for IANS, and co-founded Rugged Software -- a value-based initiative to raise awareness and usher in an era of secure digital infrastructure. His passion for challenging the status quo won him the title of Top Influencer of IT by NetworkWorld magazine in 2009. Corman received his bachelor's degree in philosophy, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude, from the University of New Hampshire. He resides with his wife and two daughters in New Hampshire.\n\nMaterials: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Percoco-Corman/DEFCON-21-Percoco-Corman-The-Calvary-Isnt-Coming-Updated.pdf"
