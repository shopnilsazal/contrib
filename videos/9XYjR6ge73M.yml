description: "PyData Ann Arbor Meetup - July 13, 2017\nSponsored by NumFOCUS, TD Ameritrade, and MIDAS\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Ann-Arbor/\n\nPyData Ann Arbor: Gus Gordon | Designing an Algorithmic Trading Strategy with Python\n\nGus Gordon is a Data Engineer at Quantopian (https://www.quantopian.com/), an algorithmic investing platform and hedge fund manager. He works on the research team, developing tools for analyzing financial data and evaluating the performance of trading strategies. Gus studied physics and economics at Bucknell University.\n\nIn this talk, Gus will go through a clean example of how to design a financial trading strategy using open source Python tools. We'll start off by analyzing a raw trading signal in alphalens, then transition that signal into an algorithm that we can backtest with zipline. Finally, we'll review the results of the backtest by going through some plots generated by pyfolio."
