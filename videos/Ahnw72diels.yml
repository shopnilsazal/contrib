We will look at some features and techniques of Python’s\nunittest.mock library and cover some useful tips and common scenarios,\nso this will be useful to those who have some experience mocking but\nwould like to do so more effectively.\n\nSummary of proposed content:\n\n1. A short introduction to what mocking is and why it is useful.\n2. Tour of Python’s mock library and how to make the most of it\n    * Creating and manipulating Mock objects\n    * Setting up return values and side effects to control test environment\n    * Inspecting mocks - different ways to examine a mock object and\nfind out what happened during the test\n    * How and where to patch\n3. Common mocking situations - scenarios where mocking is particularly\nuseful and/or tricky to get right. For example - date/time,\nfilesystem, read only properties\n4. Some discussion of when mocking is and isn't helpful.\n\nFocus will be mainly on Python's unittest.mock module but we will also\nhave a brief look at some other useful libraries."
