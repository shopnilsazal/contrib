description: "Sean Bonner is a Los Angeles-based entrepreneur, journalist, activist and enthusiast. Bonner has co-founded hackerspaces and blog networks, an art gallery, design firm and record label. He is a board member of Coffee Common, works closely with Neoteny Labs in Singapore and Tokyo and has been a regular contributor to BoingBoing. Heâ€™s one of the co-founders of Safecast (previously RDTN).\n\nSean will be talking about Safecast (previously known as RDTN), a group he co-founded in March after the 3/11 earthquake in Japan and resulting problems at the Fukushima nuclear reactor showed a vast lack of radiation data available to the public that wasnâ€™t coming from a corporation or activist group. Safecast aims to create a global open data network of sensors and is currently focused on Japan. Sean has just returned from Tokyo and will be talking about their efforts there."
