description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2015\nhttp://gotocph.com\n\nDebasish Ghosh - Software Consultant, Brick Alloy\n\nABSTRACT\nA domain model built on the principles of functional programming already has the goodness of immutability, compositionality and modularity. In this talk we demonstrate how to make functional domain models reactive, i.e. how to make them more responsive, elastic, resilient and scalable. We start with[...]\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:http://gotocon.com/cph-2015/presentation/From%20Functional%20to%20Reactive%20-%20Patterns%20in%20Domain%20Modeling\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocph\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
