description: "Find more information here: http://15.droidcon.de/session/fitness-motion-recognition-android-wear\n\nCounting is what computers do best and we should let them do it whenever possible. That's true for spreadsheets and it's true for fitness. Wearables exist to count your steps, measure the distance you run, and track how your pulse races after a workout. So why are we still counting pushups, situps, and burpees like they did in the Stone Age?\n\nIn this presentation, I will talk about the steps necessary to implement this kind of motion recognition on Android Wear:\n\n- Measuring the motion being recorded by the device\n- Deriving a pattern that represents the motion you want to recognize\n- Implementing the pattern recognition in the most battery-efficient manner possible\n\nCome find out how you can add motion recognition to your fitness app, game, or whatever else you're developing."
