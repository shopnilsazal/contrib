title: 'Ruby On Ales 2016: Introducing the Crystal Programming Language by Will Leinweber'
language: English

description: "Developer happiness is what brought me to Ruby in the first place. And of all the new compiled languages, Crystal is the only one that shares this value. The syntax and idioms are entirely Ruby inspired. Although Crystal looks very similar to Ruby, there are big differences between the two. Crystal is statically typed and dispatched. While there are no runtime dynamic features, the compile-time macros solve many of the same problems. In this session, weâ€™ll take a close look at these differences as well as the similarities, and what Ruby developers can learn from this exciting language.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/IPwv/"
