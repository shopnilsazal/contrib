language: English

description: "By Stephan Hagemann\n\nYou have a big Rails app and are feeling the pains? Stories are hard to deliver, code is hard to refactor, and your tests take a looong time? Getting you and your codebase out of this situation requires you to stop developing a \"Rails application\" and start refactoring towards your domain. I will discuss how and where you refactor towards a more structured and manageable application, a component-based Rails architecture.\n\nFor his day job Stephan is a Pivot - developing software at Pivotal Labs. With every project he especially enjoys the continuous search for doing the right thing, and doing that right. Outside of that he enjoys more work: on his old house or his rock climbing skills.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0v/"
