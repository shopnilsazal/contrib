description: "Damien George\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/199/view_talk\nMicroPython is a lean and efficient reimplementation of Python 3 with a\r\nreduced standard library, and brings the awesomeness of Python to computing\r\ndevices with few resources, such as microcontrollers.  In this talk I will\r\ndetail my journey in building MicroPython and the various projects that it\r\nhas been used in and the people who are using it.  I will talk about running\r\na successful Kickstarter campaign (actually two of them!), circuit board\r\nmanufacturing, working with the European Space Agency, working with the BBC\r\non the micro:bit project, and the challenges of managing and funding\r\nopen-source software.  There will also be some live demos!"
