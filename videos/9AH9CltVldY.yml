description: "To Feel or Not to Feel; That is the Question by Hsing-Hui Hsu\n\nIn the tech industry, and especially in the open source community, there are many frustrations and problems that everyone experiences. It is no secret, however, that these problems are not evenly distributed. Those who tend to be underrepresented in the industry find their feelings of marginalization compounded by behavior that has come to be viewed as the norm.\n\nAnd while it is also no secret that speaking out about these issues can in itself be a problem, it is not as simple as it seems. Will standing up to injustice harm your career? Are harassment and *-ism just something you should expect? Is there a certain initiation/hazing period that you have to simply suffer through before you can be taken seriously? Do certain marginalized subgroups have it worse than others, and what does that mean for those who don't have it the worst? In this talk, we'll take a deep dive into the many not-often-discussed nuances of a widely known problem.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HOIC/"
