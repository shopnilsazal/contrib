description: "Revenge of the Geeks: Hacking Fantasy Sports Sites - Dan Kuykendall\n\nIn this talk, I'll show how all my IT security geek friends in the OWASP community can win the Super Bowl! I'll walk through the anatomy of a hack against popular Fantasy Football and Baseball mobile applications showing every \"sneak play\" required to control the application. The tools and techniques used in this hack can be applied against any mobile application. These applications leverage rich new formats like JSON and REST to deliver a rich user experience, and are not surprisingly exposing the same familiar vulnerabilities like SQL and command injection, yet are not being effectively tested.\n\nIn this particular application, mistakes with the application's session management enable me to break down the nested communication formats and finally inject targeted payloads to manipulate both team lineups, to make sure my players were on top and to cause my opponents to lose. I also found that I could post false comments on the message board from the victims account.\n\nAfter we walk through the sack, I mean hack, we'll abstract these techniques, tie them directly to OWASP best practices, and apply them to other mobile applications so participants will walk away with specific tools and techniques to better understand mobile back-end hacking. Are you ready for some football?\n\nThis presentation will:\n--Provide overview and details about each of the various formats (JSON, REST, SOAP, GWTk, and AMF) in popular use today\n--Provide clear examples of basic mobile app insecurityRevenge of the Geeks: Hacking Fantasy Sports Sites In this talk, I'll show how all my IT security geek friends in the OWASP community can win the Super Bowl!
