description: "Running Multi-site, SAP Applications on Kubernetes and CoreOS - Nishi Davidson, SAP & Victoria Rozhina\n\n\"SAP Labs uses Kubernetes to deploy and scale containerized applications in select private clouds.\n\nKubernetes promises an environment consistent enough to optimally deploy and fail over workloads.\n\nWe’ll demo and talk about how we move from the current state of Enterprise applications, virtualization in private datacenters, to a world where we run (and fail over) workloads between clouds using containers and Kubernetes.\"\n\nAbout Nishi Davidson\nNishi has been in the enterprise cloud infrastructure and application space for 13 years working across engineering, customer engagement/architecture and product management in South East Asia and the US markets.
