Talk will introduce aiohttp, aioredis & aiopg -\ncornerstones for building modern Python backends and show common\nproblems & solutions while switching to aio stack.\n\nBut not only Python changed. In second part, I'll talk about what new\nhappened in frontend development, how new ES6 features modified\nJavaScript, and what React.js & Flux means for Python developers.\n\nTalk will cover real-world web application, which used aio stack on\nbackend and React.js & Flux approach on frontend and provide useful\nobservations for other developers interested in these topics."
