description: "Minecraft is not an educational game. It's a game used in education. It has gained traction with over 10,000 schools, in spite of the difficulty setting up the Java game and servers in a classroom environment. In this 2016 talk, Microsoft's Michelle Dauphiny Becker, discusses how the Minecraft team and its partners have broken down barriers to entry to make the popular game accessible to K-12 classrooms across the globe.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
