recordingDate: 1339520759
description: "Ari Juels and Ting-Fang Yen, RSA Laboratories\n\nAn Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a targeted attack against a high-value asset or a physical system. Drawing from analogies in the Sherlock Holmes stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, we illustrate potential strategies of deception and evasion available in this setting, and caution against overly narrow characterization of APTs."
