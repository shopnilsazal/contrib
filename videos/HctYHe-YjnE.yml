description: "RailsConf 2017: In Relentless Pursuit of REST by Derek Prior\n\n\"That's not very RESTful.\" As a Rails developer you've probably heard or even spoken that proclamation before, but what does it really mean? What's so great about being RESTful anyway?\n\nRESTful architecture can narrow the responsibilities of your Rails controllers and make follow-on refactorings more natural. In this talk, you'll learn to refactor code to follow RESTful principles and to identify the positive impact those changes have throughout your application stack."
