description: 'The dark-web including TOR, FreeNet and I2P, is that part of the Internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines and where anonymity and confidentiality is enforced at the root. For these characteristics, cyber- criminals started abusing the dark-web to conduct illicit or malicious activities like illegal trading, malware hosting, and more recently targeted attacks.
