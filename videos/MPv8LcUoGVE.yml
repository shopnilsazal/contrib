title: '#HITB2016AMS D2T2 - Go Speed Tracer   Guided Fuzzing - Richard Johnson'
recordingDate: 1466840176
description: "The past few years have seen a leap in fuzzing technology. The original paradigm established a decade ago resulted in two widely deployed approaches to fuzzing: sample based mutation and model based generation. Thanks to ever-increasing computational performance and better engineering, newer guided fuzzing approaches have proven to be supremely effective with a low cost of deployment. This talk will explore a few different approaches to guided fuzzing through dynamic analysis including code coverage analysis, constraint solving, and sampling/profiling based feedback mechanisms.\n\nNovel contributions in this talk include:\n\n– Opensource Windows Driver enabling Intel “Processor Trace”\n– DBI based tracing engine for Windows/Linux/OSX binaries\n– American Fuzzy Lop with full support for Windows binary targets\n\n=====\n\nRichard Johnson is a computer security specialist with a focus on software vulnerability analysis. Currently the Research Manager of Talos Group for Cisco, Richard offers 15 years of expertise and leadership in the software security industry. Current responsibilities include research and development of advanced fuzzing and crash analysis technologies facilitating the automation of the vulnerability triage and discovery process. Richard has presented annually at top-tier industry conferences worldwide for over a decade and was co-founder of the Uninformed Journal."
