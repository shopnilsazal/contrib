description: "Title: Zero Down Time Operations: How to Get Atleast 3 9's of Uptime\nPresented by: Taylor Weibley\n\nNo one wins an award for having the most popular status site. I'll show you the top practical techniques we (37signals) use for keeping our sites available at all times, even during scheduled maintenance!
