description: 'Ever wondered how Microsoft takes the combined work of over 11,000 engineers developing  Windows at Microsoft, bring it together in one branch, build, test and get it onto your desktop. Want to know what happens to the telemetry, error reports and bugs that you send and how Microsoft tracks them through to fixes. In this session we''ll take you through the VSTS based engineering system used by Windows, talk about the transformation to Agile practises and to Git for version control and talk about what improvements we are hoping to make in the future.'
