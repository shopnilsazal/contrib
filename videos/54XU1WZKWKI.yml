description: "Let's Continue to Talk About Pay by Lauren Voswinkel\n\nOn International Workers' Day I asked the world to #talkpay, and many people did. Pay transparency is critical in order to address pay inequity in our field, as well as others, but there's more to it than that. I'd like to discuss why this taboo surrounding pay got started, illustrate just how concerted of an effort there is to prevent workers (including tech workers) from pushing for higher pay, and why, exactly, we NEED to talk about pay.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HNmz/"
