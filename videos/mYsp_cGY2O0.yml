description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nKubernetes 101: DIY Workshop - Bridget Kromhout, Microsoft (Beginner Skill Level)\n\nIf you want to level up the k8s game at your organization, maybe what you need is a hands-on workshop. In this whirlwind tour of a successful interactive workshop, we'll look at how to give people a guided hands-on k8s experience. If you're into dev or ops or some portmanteau thereof, this is relevant to your interests. We&rsquo;ll be following an Azure variant based on open-source k8s training http://container.training/, as well as checking out AKS (Azure Container Service); there are takeaways no matter which public or private cloud you use.\n\n\"About Bridget\nBridget Kromhout is a Principal Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft. Her CS degree emphasis was in theory, but she now deals with the concrete (if 'cloud' can be considered tangible). After 15 years as an operations engineer, she traded being on call for being on a plane. A frequent speaker and program committee member for tech conferences, she leads the devopsdays organization globally and the devops community at home in Minneapolis. She podcasts with Arrested DevOps, blogs at bridgetkromhout.com, and is active in a Twitterverse near you.\""
