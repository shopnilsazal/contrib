description: "Copy of the slides for this talk are here:https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Maloney/DEFCON-20-Maloney-Railgun.pdf \n\nWeaponizing the Windows API with Metasploit's Railgun\nDavid \"thelightcosine\" Maloney Software Engineer, Metasploit Rapid7\n\nNo part of the Metasploit Framework has been shrouded in more mystery and confusion than the Railgun extension. Railgun is one of the most powerful tools in the Metasploit arsenal when it comes to Post Exploitation. In this talk we will examine what Railgun is, and how we can use it to turn Windows completely against itself by weaponizing the Windows API libraries. We will demystify Railgun by explaining exactly how it works under the covers and how you can use it to create powerful post modules.\n\nDavid \"thelightcosine\" Maloney is a Software Engineer on the Metasploit Team at Rapid7. Before joining the team, he was a frequent contributor to the open source side of the project. As a contributor he specialized in Post Exploitation. Before Rapid7 he was a Penetration Tester, most recently for Time Warner Cable. David is also one of the founders of Hackerspace Charlotte in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nTwitter: @thelightcosine"
