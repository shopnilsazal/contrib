description: "Andrew Hamilton, Zefr, Inc.\n\nPython has become the default language for tool building for SREs. Go stands a good chance to become the new preferred language for such development. In this talk we'll quickly discuss the similarities and differences between Python and Go and why Go is a great fit for SRE and Operations tasks. Then we'll go through a basic example of building a tool and how Go can make us more efficient."
