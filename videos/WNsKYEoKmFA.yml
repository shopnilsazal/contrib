recordingDate: 1391814886
description: "Jennifer Granick, Top Ten Legal Issues in Computer Security\n\nThis will be a practical and theoretical tutorial on legal issues related to computer security practices. In advance of the talk, Granick will unscientifically determine the \"Top Ten Legal Questions About Computer Security\" that Defcon attendees have and will answer them as clearly as the unsettled nature of the law allows. While the content of the talk is audience driven, Granick expects to cover legal issues related to vulnerability disclosure, copyright infringement, reverse engineering, free speech, surveillance and civil liberties.\n\nJennifer Stisa Granick joined Stanford Law School in January 2001, as Lecturer in Law and Executive Director of the Center for Internet and Society (CIS). She teaches, speaks and writes on the full spectrum of Internet law issues including computer crime and security, national security, constitutional rights, and electronic surveillance, areas in which her expertise is recognized nationally.\n\nGranick came to Stanford after almost a decade practicing criminaldefense law in California. Her experience includes stints at the Office of the State Public Defender and at a number of criminal defense boutiques, before founding the Law Offices of Jennifer S. Granick, where she focused on hacker defense and other computer law representations at the trial and appellate level in state and federal court. At Stanford, she currently teaches the Cyberlaw Clinic, one of the nation's few public interest law and technology litigation clinics.\n\nGranick continues to consult on computer crime cases and serves on the Board of Directors of the Honeynet Project, which collects data on computer intrusions for the purposes of developing defensive tools and practices and the Hacker Foundation, a research and service organization promoting the creative use of technological resources.\n\nShe was selected by Information Security magazine in 2003 as one of 20 \"Women of Vision\" in the computer security field. She earned her law degree from University of California, Hastings College of the Law and her undergraduate degree from the New College of the University of South Florida."
