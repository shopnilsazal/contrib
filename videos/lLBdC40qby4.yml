description: "Keynote: Your Philips Hue Light Bulbs Are Turned On By Kubernetes - Mark van Straten, Senior Software Architect, Q42\n\nPhilips Hue is one of the leading global Internet of Things platforms and has integrations with Amazon Echo, Google Home, IFTTT & Nest to make your lights work for you. The platform has grown considerably during the past years and to accommodate this has been migrated towards Google Container Engine at the end of 2015.\n\nWe needed to find out how to do zero downtime deployments, grasp how scaling works in Kubernetes, provide ourselves with monitoring and logging and above all find out how to do all these things and more while staying agile in the process. Come join me if you want to start using Kubernetes in production but are not sure yet what you are going to be facing.\n\nAbout Mark Van Straten\nLove to talk about Kubernetes, Rx or Coffee. Technical lead of the Philips Hue Cloud"
