title: 'RailsConf 2015 - Implementing a Strong Code-Review Culture'
recordingDate: 1430390263
description: "By Derek Prior\n\nCode reviews are not about catching bugs. Modern code reviews are about socialization, learning, and teaching.\n\nHow can you get the most out of a peer's code review and how can you review code without being seen as overly critical? Reviewing code and writing easily-reviewed features are skills that will make you a better developer and a better teammate.\n\nYou will leave this talk with the tools to implement a successful code-review culture. You'll learn how to get more from the reviews you're already getting and how to have more impact with the reviews you leave.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/G6iP/"
