description: "By, Yonatan Bergman\nBoard games are seeing a huge resurgence right now, everywhere you look people are playing new games. The Internet and crowd funding has made it possible for almost anyone to design and develop a physical board game.\n\nJoin me while I share the story of how I used Ruby to design my first board game. How I honed the game mechanics and optimized all the different moving parts. You will leave this talk knowing the process of designing and developing a board game from scratch and how Ruby can help you iterate fast on new ideas using simple code, simulations and some statistics.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FTev/"
