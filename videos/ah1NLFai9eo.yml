description: "by Brabo Silvius\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nFROSTED is an acronym that means \"FRee Operating System for Tiny EmbeddedDevices\". The goal of this project is to provide a free kernel for embeddedsystems, which exposes a POSIX-compliant system call API. In this talk I aimto explain why we started this project, the approach we took to separate thekernel and user-space on Cortex-M CPU's without MMU, and showcase the latestimprovements on networking and supported applications.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 14:00:00"
