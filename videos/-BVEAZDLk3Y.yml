Addingnew behaviors and search methods can be a mess.\n\nDon't struggle anymore! This talk shows you how to decouple you from the ORMand writing general search behaviors for all your entities with thespecification pattern. Your new specifications are not tied to any specificORM and can be reused on different levels.\n\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 14:00:00"
