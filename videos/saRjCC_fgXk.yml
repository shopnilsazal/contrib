description: "\"Generally speaking I have a hard time dealing with authority for authorityâ€™s sake.\" Most of us can relate to this - but how do you deal with it?\n\nThis is an experiment with a podcast-style format where David and I  lift the non-tech aspects of life at work. These other \"things\" and conflicts can often severely limit your performance and enjoyment of dev life.\n\nMusings 2.0?? Maybe!\n\nLet us now what you think of this format and the discussion in the comments. \n\nSubscribe if you want more of this!\n\nThe topic discussed is taken from the Fun Fun Forum https://www.funfunforum.com/t/help-me-mpj-and-david-pick-a-theme-for-an-on-the-job-collab/4969/2 (patron-only). Access to the forum is available to all patrons of Fun Fun Function: https://www.patreon.com/funfunfunction\n\nThere's a companion discussion on how to deal with anti-motivation on DevTips: https://youtu.be/tS9Ug-vm1oU"
