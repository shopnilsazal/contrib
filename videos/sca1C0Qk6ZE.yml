description: "'Did you mean?' experience in Ruby and beyond by Yuki Nishijima\n\ndid_you_mean gem is a gem that adds a Google-like suggestion feature to Ruby. Whenever you mis-spell a method name, it'll read your mind and tell you the right one. \n\nAlthough the history of the gem isn't long, it got so many improvements since it's first released back in February 2014. In this talk, I'll talk about what improvements have been made after a quick introduction of how it works. \n\nHave a custom Exception class and want to make it 'correctable'? Let's learn how to create your own finder so you can improve your coding experience in Ruby.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Ghc7/"
