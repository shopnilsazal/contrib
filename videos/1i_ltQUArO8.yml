title: '#HITB2016AMS D2T1 - Attacking Next Generation Firewalls: Breaking PAN OS - Felix Wilhelm'
recordingDate: 1467204133
description: "“Next-Generation” firewalls provide functionality well beyond the traditional filtering capabilities. They offer deep protocol inspection, application identification, user based filtering, VPN functionality and more.\n\nWhile this significantly increases the attack surface of these devices, little public research is available. In this talk I will present an in-depth analysis of one of the leading NGFW solutions: PAN-OS. Besides describing the overall system architecture, I will discuss and demonstrate several critical vulnerabilities in the different components that can result in a full remote compromise of the appliance. To go beyond 2015 & the pure bashing of security appliances, I’ll also present some positive insights.\n\n=====\n\nFelix is a security researcher working for ERNW Research. His main interests are application security, reverse engineering and virtualization security. Felix has disclosed critical vulnerabilities in popular products such as Xen, Hyper-V, IBM GPFS or FireEye’s MPS and has presented his work at international conferences like PHDays, Hack in the Box, 44Con, Infiltrate and Troopers."
