description: "Bruce Potter - Bluetooth - The Future of Wardriving\nBluetooth - The Future of Wardriving\n\nBy some estimates, there are more Bluetooth radios deployed than 802.11 radios. However, Bluetooth as largely been ignored by the security community. Over the next several years, this will change dramatically as Bluetooth security tools catch up with 802.11 security tools. Bluetooth devices tend to be always-on machines that generally contain and transmit highly personalized information. Due to limitations of the platforms and interfaces that utilize Bluetooth, many developers chose to avoid implementing security mechanisms. This combination of private information and lowered security makes Bluetooth a likely candidate for attacks targeted at an individual... or simply an interesting protocol to keep voyeurs happy.\n\nThis talk will cover the basics of the Bluetooth protocol and its security mechanisms. I will discuss attacks that may be carried out against Bluetooth enabled PANs. I will compare Bluetooth and 802.11, especially from a discovery and interception point of view. Finally, I will present The Shmoo Group's new Bluetooth wardriving utility.\n\nBruce Potter has a broad information security background. From application security assessments to low-level smartcard analysis to wireless network deployments, Bruce has worked in both the open- and closed-source communities. Trained in computer science at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Bruce now serves as a Senior Security Consultant for Cigital, Inc. in Dulles VA. Bruce is founder and President of Capital Area Wireless Network, a non-profit community wireless initiative based in Washington DC. In 1999 Bruce founded The Shmoo Group, an ad-hoc group of security professionals scattered throughout the world. Bruce co-authored 802.11 Security published through O'Reilly and Associates. He is co-authoring Mac OS X Security to be published by New Riders Publishing in May of 2003."
