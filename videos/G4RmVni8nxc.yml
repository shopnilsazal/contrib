description: "View slides for this presentation here:\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/PyData/matt-greenwood-scott-draves-the-polyglot-beaker-notebook\n\nPyData NYC 2014\nThe Beaker Notebook is a new open source tool for collaborative data science. Like IPython, Beaker uses a notebook-based metaphor for idea flow. However, Beaker was designed to be polyglot from the ground up. That is, a single notebook may contain cells from multiple different languages that communicate with one another through a unique feature called autotranslation. You can set a variable in a Python cell and then read that variable in a subsequent R cell, and everything just works â€“ magically. Beaker comes with built-in support for Python, R, Groovy, Julia, and Javascript. In addition, Beaker also supports multiple kinds of cells for text, like HTML, LaTeX, Markdown, and our own visualization library that allows for the plotting of large data sets. This talk will motivate the design, review the architecture, and include a live demo of Beaker in action."
