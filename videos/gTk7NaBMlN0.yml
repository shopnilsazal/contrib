description: "Modern Databases by: Eric Redmond\n\nChoosing a data storage engine is an important decision, but it doesnâ€™t have to be painful if you know the landscape. Weâ€™ll look at several DBMSs (and a few youâ€™ve never heard of), compare and contrast them based on use-cases, and how to plug each into Ruby.\nAuthoring the book \"Seven Databases in Seven Weeks\" has opened up a whole world of database alternatives that I never before seriously considered. Itâ€™s an important decision to be made by research, not buzzwords â€“ and weâ€™ve sifted through them so you donâ€™t have to. At the very least we can settle the Mongo v. Couch debate (hint: theyâ€™re both awesome).\nThis is not the same RailsConf talk. This is split into two parts:\nThe components of modern databases:\nA 30,000 foot view of the current database ecosystem\nUnderstanding why the CAP theorem is true\nUnderstanding map/reduce from the Ruby perspective\n12 databases in 12 minutes:\nThe similarities/differences of the most popular open source DBs today\nWhen to use them, when to avoid them\nWhich Ruby drivers to use"
