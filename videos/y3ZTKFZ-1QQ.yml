title: 'Ryan Rosario - Sentiment Classification Using scikit-learn'
recordingDate: 1402200866
description: "PyData SV 2014 \nFacebook users produce millions of pieces of text content every day. Text content such as status updates and comments tell us a lot about how people feel on a daily basis and how people feel about the web of things. In this talk, we discuss a system based on scikit-learn and the Python scientific computing ecosystem that describes and models positive and negative sentiment of user generated content on Facebook. Unlike more traditional polarized word counting methodologies, our system trains machine learning classifiers using naturally labelled data to achieve high accuracy."
