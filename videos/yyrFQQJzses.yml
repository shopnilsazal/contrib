description: "You know JRuby and you love JRuby, but you have no idea how to contribute. What's a Rubyist to do? In this talk, JRuby core team members will give you a tour of the codebase, showing how JRuby parses Ruby code, implements Strings and other core classes, and eventually compiles and optimizes JRuby code on the JVM. You'll learn how to debug JRuby, profile performance or memory hotspots, implement extensions in Java or Ruby, and ultimately how to contribute back to JRuby.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GXlH/"
