description: "\"Inspect (Or Gadget)\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - Anfiteatro 2]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nIntrospection is often seen as a bad coding practice and as\nsuch a gadget.\nNevertheless, the Python Standard Library provides different tools\n(among them the 'inspect' library) to easily identify a generator,\nrecover the source code of a function or get a function signature.\nWe propose to spend 1/2 hour to dig into what introspection has to offer\nto developers, to see what tools are available, what you can get out of\nthem and some useful use cases that we met in our practice at Criteo.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
