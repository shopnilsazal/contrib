description: "RailsConf 2017: Goldilocks And The Three Code Reviews by Vaidehi Joshi\n\nOnce upon a time, Goldilocks had a couple extra minutes to spare before morning standup. She logged into Github and saw that there were three pull requests waiting for her to review.\n\nWe've probably all heard that peer code reviews can do wonders to a codebase. But not all type of code reviews are effective. Some of them seem to go on and on forever, while others pick at syntax and formatting but miss bugs. This talk explores what makes a strong code review and what makes a painful one. Join Goldilocks as she seeks to find a code review process that's neither too long nor too short, but just right!"
