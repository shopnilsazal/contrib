description: "by Dave Cridland\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nMetre is an XMPP Server, but not one that serves XMPP. Instead, it lives inthe nether regions between servers - being a Man In The Middle by design andintent - filtering and securing traffic as required.\n\nMetre supports pretty well every bell, whistle, and in fact any other musicalinstrument of XMPP Server to Server security. It then filters traffic, dropsstanzas you don't want, eliding it totally on occasion.\n\nIt'll throw your traffic over TLS, over DANE, over SATCOM.\n\nIt'll log it all.\n\nIt'll protect your autonomous security domain.\n\nIt'll wag its little tail when it sees you in the morning, but you won't haveto take it for walks.\n\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 15:20:00"
