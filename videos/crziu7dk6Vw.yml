description: "Five machine learning techniques that you can use in your Ruby apps today By Benjamin Curtis\n\nMachine learning is everywhere these days. Features like search, voice recognition, recommendations - they've become so common that people have started to expect them. They're starting to expect the apps we build to be smarter.\nTen years ago, machine learning and data mining techniques were only available to the people dedicated enough to dig through the math. Now that's not the case.\nThe most common machine learning techniques are well known. Standard approaches have been developed. And, fortunately for us, many of these are available as ruby gems. Some are even easy to implement yourself.\nIn this presentation we'll cover five important machine learning techniques that can be used in a wide range of applications. It will be a wide and shallow introduction, for Rubyists, not mathematicians - we'll have plenty of simple code examples.\nBy the end of the presentation, you won't be an expert, but you'll know about a class of tools you may not have realized were available.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2G/"
