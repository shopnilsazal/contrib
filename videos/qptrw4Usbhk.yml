description: "Faced with the challenge of securing hundreds of applications in our organization, we struggled to find the capacity to manually scan them all and still have the time to focus on our more critical issues. Having to deal with a wide variety of programming languages, platforms, legacy applications and needing to prioritize a never ending list of applications with limited time and resources\nSound familiar?\n\nJoin our journey and live demo of how we are utilizing \"machines\" to automate assessments. We'll show you the technologies we chose not to use, and why; how understanding our requirements better allowed us to focus on the things we really needed rather than the ideal solution.\n\nOur team will showcase how we've utilized a blend of Jenkins, HP Fortify SCA/SSC, OWASP ZAP, OWASP DefectDojo, Slack and Jira to create an automation-scanning and reporting platform.\n\nWe're anticipating a highly collaborative session and hope you'll join - feedback, criticism and praise are all welcome!\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
