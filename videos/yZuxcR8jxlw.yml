description: "Ian Lewis - Deep Learning with Python & TensorFlow\n[EuroPython 2016]\n[22 July 2016]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/deep-learning-with-python-tensorflow)\n\nPython has lots of scientific, data analysis, and machine learning\nlibraries. But there are many problems when starting out on a machine\nlearning project. Which library do you use? How do they compare to\neach other? How can you use a model that has been trained in your\nproduction app? In this talk I will discuss how you can use TensorFlow\nto create Deep Learning applications. I will discuss how it compares\nto other Python machine learning libraries, and how to deploy into\nproduction.\n\n-----\n\nPython has lots of scientific, data analysis, and machine learning\nlibraries. But there are many problems when starting out on a machine\nlearning project. Which library do you use? How do they compare to\neach other? How can you use a model that has been trained in your\nproduction application?\n\nTensorFlow is a new Open-Source framework created at Google for\nbuilding Deep Learning applications. Tensorflow allows you to\nconstruct easy to understand data flow graphs in Python which form a\nmathematical and logical pipeline. Creating data flow graphs allow\neasier visualization of complicated algorithms as well as running the\ntraining operations over multiple hardware GPUs in parallel.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss how you can use TensorFlow to create Deep\nLearning applications. I will discuss how it compares to other Python\nmachine learning libraries like Theano or Chainer. Finally, I will\ndiscuss how trained TensorFlow models could be deployed into a\nproduction system using TensorFlow Serve."
