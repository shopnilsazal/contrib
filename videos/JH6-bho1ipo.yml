description: "This week, James is joined by friend of the show Laurent Bugnion, Software engineer and UX enthusiast at Valorem/IdentityMine, introduces us to the world of developing with the MVVM Light Toolkit with Xamarin development. The MVVM Light Toolkit offers Xamarin developers a MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) library that adds data binding, commands, navigation, extensions, and a whole lot more to traditional development with Xamarin. Laurent even shows us the use cases and compatibility with Xamarin.Forms. \n\nShow Links:\n\nMVVM Light Toolkit: http://www.mvvmlight.net/ \nMVVM Light Toolkit Pluralsight Course: https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/mvvm-light-toolkit-fundamentals\nLaurent's Site & Blog: http://www.galasoft.ch/\n\nFind James on Twitter: http://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno \nGitHub: http://github.com/jamesmontemagno\nBlog: https://montemagno.com\nand his weekly development podcast Merge Conflict: http://www.mergeconflict.fm\n\nNever Miss an Episode: https://twitter.com/thexamarinshow\nFollow @TheXamarinShow\n\nUseful Links:\n\nXamarin Developer Center & Blog: https://developer.xamarin.com/\nXamarin and Azure: https://www.xamarin.com/azure\nMobile DevOps: https://www.xamarin.com/mobile-devops\nXamarin University Self-Guided: https://university.xamarin.com/self-guided\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree"
