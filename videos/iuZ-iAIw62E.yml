description: "Hi, I'm [NAME] and I'm an introvert. But contrary to what you might think, it's not a problem and I am not working on it. In fact, I've embraced it.\n\nIn this session, we'll explore the strengths of introversion within the realm of programming and software development. We'll discuss how it plays a role in your interactions with other developers, your preferred work environment, and yes, even your code.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FixL/"
