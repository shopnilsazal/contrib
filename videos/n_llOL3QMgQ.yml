Experienced in both frontend and backend, he's keen on designing interfaces and APIs for long-living enterprise systems. Tomek aims to provide a truly scalable architecture, solving both technical and organisational issues. He considers software development as a challenge of creating small and maintainable pieces of code that provide big business profit. TDD, CI, agile are also among his interests. \nTomek takes part in international projects from financial and data analysis sectors, currently working in Cybercom Poland as Senior Software Consultant. Tomek regularly speaks at conferences in meetups and does workshops on JavaScript and JS-related related technologies.\n\n\nng-enterprise\nClick... and here it is. Our AngularJS application has been deployed to 120 Scandinavian banks, starting to replace an old legacy system. It took us over 1 year to reach production and we learned some lessons you'll never read in any tutorial. \n\nClick... tech-part. How would you deal with data binding and cross-component communication in a huge system? What does a directive represent in an enterprise-scale application? How to make 2 architectures, the legacy and angular, co-exist? And, damn, the backend is down again! \n\nClick... business-part. So all these people are Java developers...? Guys, are you really sure, that this latest JS buzzword is our biggest concern at the moment? By the way - did Angular 2 make our AngularJS interface a legacy app already? And does anyone know if the backend is up anyway? \n\nI'll share my experience of doing something really amazing, yet difficult, having Angular playing the lead role in crazy financial sector!"
