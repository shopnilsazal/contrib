description: 'Over the last year we shipped no less than three "point releases" of C# (7.1, 7.2 and 7.3), full of small but useful language features. Mads and Dustin will race you through a tour of these, before turning to some of the big things we have in store for the future: Nullable reference types, recursive patterns, asynchronous streams and more.'
