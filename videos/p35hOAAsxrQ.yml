recordingDate: 1491874395
description: "The Open Service Broker API and the Kubernetes Service Catalog [B] - Paul Morie, Red Hat & Chip Childers, Cloud Foundry Foundation\n\nThe next frontier for Kubernetes is allowing seamless integration with the vast array of service brokers available in the microservice-based software ecosystem via a service catalog. The Open Service Broker API is an industry standard that allows service operators to integrate with multiple platforms using a single API specification.\n\nIn this session, you’ll learn exactly what the Open Service Broker API specification is, its history, how the cross-ecosystem collaboration on the API specification is happening and especially how the Kubernetes ecosystem is building integrations with this specification via the service catalog project. We’ll briefly talk about how to get involved in the Kubernetes Special Interest Group (SIG), and if the audience behaves, we’ll even do a demo!\n\nAbout Chip Childers\nA proven DevOps visionary and leader. Before coming to the Foundation, Chip was vice president of Product Strategy at CumuLogic. He spent more than 15 years in engineering leadership positions within the service provider industry including work with SunGard Availability Services and Qwest Solutions. He has served on the board of directors for the Distributed Management Task Force; and is a member of The Apache Software Foundation.\n\nAbout Paul Morie\nPaul is a Principal Engineer at Red Hat and is a committer to the Kubernetes project. He is currently leading the Kubernetes Service Catalog SIG and the champion of the service-catalog Kubernetes incubator repository. Before Kubernetes, he worked on the first three versions of Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform and built multi-tenant platforms for the financial and insurance industries. He likes spending time with his wife, scale model making, and striving for perfect hair."
