With Pandas dealing with data-analysis is easy and simple but there are some things you need to get your head around first as Data-Frames and Data-Series.\n\nThe tutorial provides a compact introduction to Pandas for beginners:\n\n-reading and writing data across multiple formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL, HTML,â€¦)\n-data visualisation\n-statistical data analysis and aggregation.\n-work with built-in data visualisation\n-inner-mechanics of Pandas: Data-Frames, Data-Series & Numpy.\n-working and making the most of indexes.\n-how to mangle, reshape and pivot\n\nThe tutorial will be provided as Jupiter notebooks.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
