description: "One of the greatest challenges of video game AI is that of creating believable companions that inhabit the world. This GDC 2014 talk from Irrational's John Abercrombie explains how these seemingly contradictory design goals of BioShock Infinite's companion character, Elizabeth, were solved by leveraging philosophies from other entertainment mediums, as well as one of Irrational's core design pillars.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
