title: 'AlterConf Seattle 2015 - Updated Spoon Theory for the Tech Industry by: Whitney Levis'
recordingDate: 1441121216
description: "Spoon theory is an analogy used to try to explain the lived experience of people with lupus, which may not be obvious to the casual observer but have a major impact on the day-to-day capacity of the individual with the condition. Many communities have adopted this metaphor to discuss limitations inherent in their circumstance. My journey with spoons has been long and winding. Starting with my experience as a neurodiverse person (specifically on the autism spectrum) and winding my way through my recent experiences with lupus, we will consider many types of spoons, their quantities, and the coping skills I use to manage my spoons. Finally we will journey through the contexts I've encountered in tech and look at the support I've received and the work we can do to support those with less spoons.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HCPN/"
