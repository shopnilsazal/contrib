description: "PyData NYC 2015\n\nThere is a lot of hype and speculation about the deep web. Whether focused on size or variety, there's one common theme ... opportunity. The intelligence gathering phase of any decision should not end at a Google search. Many companies are already tapping this wealth of data with open tools and practices.\n\nComing from a background of tracking black markets on the web in the DARPA Memex program, we will show how to use tools that go beyond the surface web and pull out rich structured data to analyze. In this presentation, we'll dive into using our Python based open source tool stack for building an analytics search engine and utilizing the rest of the Python ecosystem for analysis.\n\nSlides available here: http://www.slideshare.net/kriehl/memex-pydata-new-york-2015"
