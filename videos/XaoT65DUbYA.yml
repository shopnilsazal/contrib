description: "Josef Heinen - Getting more out of Matplotlib with GR\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nPython is well established in software development departments of\nresearch and industry, not least because of the proliferation of\nlibraries such as _SciPy_ and _Matplotlib_. However, when processing\nlarge amounts of data, in particular in combination with GUI toolkits\n(_Qt_) or three-dimensional visualizations (_OpenGL_), Python as an\ninterpretative programming language seems to be reaching its limits.\nIn particular, large amounts of data or the visualization of three-\ndimensional scenes may overwhelm the system.\n\nThis presentation shows how visualization applications with special\nperformance requirements can be designed on the basis of _Matplotlib_\nand _GR_, a high-performance visualization library for Linux, OS X and\nWindows. The lecture focuses on the development of a new graphics\nbackend for _Matplotlib_ based on the _GR_ framework. By combining the\npower of those libraries the responsiveness of animated visualization\napplications and their resulting frame rates can be improved\nsignificantly. This in turn allows the use of _Matplotlib_ in real-\ntime environments, for example in the area of signal processing.\n\nUsing concrete examples, the presentation will demonstrate the\nbenefits of the [GR framework][1] as a companion module for\n_Matplotlib_, both in _Python_ and _Julia_. Based on selected\napplications, the suitability of the _GR framework_ will be\nhighlighted especially in environments where time is critical. The\nsystemâ€™s performance capabilities will be illustrated using demanding\nlive applications. In addition, the special abilities of the _GR\nframework_ are emphasized in terms of interoperability with graphical\nuser interfaces (_Qt/PySide_) and _OpenGL_, which opens up new\npossibilities for existing _Matplotlib_ applications.\n\n[1]: http://gr-framework.org"
