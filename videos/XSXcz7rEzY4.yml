title: 'Ian Huston - Using Cloud Foundry for Data Driven Python Apps'
recordingDate: 1418147132
description: "PyData NYC 2014\nAs a data scientist I frequently need to create web apps to provide interactive functionality, deliver data APIs or simply publish results. It is now easier than ever to deploy your data driven web app by using cloud based application platforms to do the heavy lifting. Cloud Foundry is an open source public and private cloud platform that supports Python based applications (along with other languages) and enables simple app deployment, scaling and connectivity to data services like PostgreSQL, Redis and Cassandra. To make use of the full PyData stack I have created a Heroku-style buildpack which uses conda for package management. This means for example that you can get a private IPython Notebook server up and running in seconds. In this talk I want to show you how to:\n-deploy your first app using Cloud Foundry,\n-connect to databases and other data services,\n-use PyData packages with a Heroku-style buildpack,\n-find public and private Cloud Foundry installation options."
