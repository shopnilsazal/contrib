description: "Rae Knowler | Thursday 09:30 | Assembly Room\n\n**Apologies for the occasional mumbled speech over this video, a mic was accidentally left live next to the mixer for part of Thursday, it's mostly not too intrusive**\n\nThe default settings of some libraries and tools are so useless, or even dangerous, that they should never be used. While they give the impression of being easy to use or performant, they actually represent traps for the unwary user. I will show the concrete problems caused by these defaults, and the correct way to proceed with Python in each case.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/bellisk/unsafe-at-any-speed-pycon-uk-26th-october-2017"
