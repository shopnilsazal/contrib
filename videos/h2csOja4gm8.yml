description: "\"Multiple small services are more scalable and favored over single monolithic applications. But, after you split the app into multiple services, you lose the flexibility of testing using Factories (data setup) and ActiveRecord (data verification). This talk explores a way to use DRuby to access factories/models across multiple services from an external Cucumber testsuite to test a distributed system like one big app.\n\nThis talk is based on using druby for testing 2 experimental services and not based on real world usage: https://github.com/sathish316/druby-integration-tests\n* This talk uses the word distributed systems loosely to mean multiple small services in an SOA based architecture\"\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8V/"
