An Introduction to Tor, Darknets, and Bitcoin \nMetacortex SECURITY RESEARCHER \nGrifter SECURITY RESEARCHER \nThis is an introduction level talk. The talk itself will cover the basics of Tor, Darknets, Darknet Market places, and Bitcoin. I will start by giving the audience an overview of Tor and how it works. I will cover entry nodes, exit nodes, as well as hidden services. I will then show how you connect to Tor on both Linux/OSX and Windows and demo it off. Once we are connected to Tor, I am going to show how to find Tor hidden services and then demo off browsing around some marketplaces. Once the audience has a solid grasp on what the market places offer, I am going to start dealing the process of purchasing something off of it. I will cover bitcoin and bitcoin mining. After we know about how bitcoin works, we will cover purchasing items. I will cover purchasing PO Box's and the pickup of packages. Finally I will finish up with some concerns you may want to be aware of and my recommendations to help make the use of TOR, Bitcoin, and Marketplaces more secure.\n\nAs a infosec professional by day, Metacortex much prefers his hacker by night persona. Most of his free time time is spent helping run both DC801 and the Salt Lake City based HackerSpace 801 Labs. He loves talking about anything hacking related and does everything he can to help promote and build the northern Utah hacking community.\n\nTwitter: @metacortex\n\nGrifter has been a DEF CON Goon for 14 years. He is currently the Senior Goon in charge of DEF CON Evening Event space and the DEF CON Villages. In previous lives he served as a Security, Vendor, and Skybox Goon, Coordinator of the DEF CON Movie Channel, former Organizer of the Scavenger Hunt, and Administrator of the DEF CON Forums. He birthed the idea of the DEF CON Villages and DC Groups into the world, and he's not sorry about it.\n\nGrifter has spoken at DEF CON numerous times, as well as related Hacker, Security, and Industry conferences. He has co-authored several books on various information security topics, and has somehow found a way to convince people to give him money for what he keeps inside his head.(The technical stuff, not the dirty stuffâ€¦yet.) He uses this money to provide food and shelter for his family in Salt Lake City, Utah, where he is an active part of DC801, and a founding member of the 801 Labs hackerspace."
