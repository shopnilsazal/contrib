description: "Filmed at PyData London 2017\nwww.pydata.org\n\nDescription\nThis talk discuses an approach to personalise search results by leveraging techniques of recommender systems .We use Pyspark to set up the data and calculate recommendation and preference elements and Elasticsearch as a search engine\n\nAbstract\nThese days a lot of companies are building recommendations engines. The techniques for doing so are widely known and open source technology is accessible. We were experimenting to investigate how we can leverage our recommendations engine to extend personalisation to search results. Besides surfacing items that are relevant based on the search term our approach aims to increase relevancy for each user by considering their personal preferences. We use Pyspark to set up the data and calculate recommendation and preference elements and Elasticsearch as a search engine where we integrate our recommendations approach. We are looking into various ways of how to incorporate customer preferences such as item similarities, matrix factorisation output and preference inference.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
