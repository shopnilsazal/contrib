recordingDate: 1472750261
description: "Sebastien Lambla\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2016/netfringe/sfcxpy/\nHypermedia and unicorns are so 2011! The next evolution in APIs on the web may well be linked data. With the recent adoption of json-ld by Google, we may finally be seeing the semantic web break into our world, providing the benefits of graphs to extract semantics from your APIs. We will discover, by visiting a magical world, what resources are and how they relate to one another. Don't be afraid, you will discover many mythical creatures, from resources and tuples to json-ld, hydra, and maybe even a sprinkle of RDF. So come feed the links!"
