description: "By: Ben Carey\n\nAgile methods promise an iterative and incremental approach to building software. Unfortunately, the iterative portion is often omitted when it comes to incorporating true user feedback and observation. In this workshop, participants will learn how to apply a method known as â€œdiscount usability testingâ€ to allow for fast and useful feedback from users that can be incorporated into their product delivery process."
