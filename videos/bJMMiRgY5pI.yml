description: "Find more information here: http://droidcon.de/session/common-pitfalls-mobile-testing\n\nWriting tests for Mobile Applications is no big deal anymore. Most of the Frameworks have matured and provide a stable quality and a adequate documentation on how to use it. So when talking about testing e.g. during code reviews developers no longer ask \"How can I (technically) write tests for Mobile?\" and the Code Coverage increases constantly. \n\nBut there are still many pitfalls when writing tests, a technically working testcase is not necessarily a good testcase or in worst case it is no testcase at all. During my talk I will show some examples from past projects with common mistakes when writing Unit, Integration or Instrumentation Test and show techniques, tools or just questions-to-ask to avoid this mistakes and write good and sufficient tests."
