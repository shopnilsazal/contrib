description: "\"Discovering Descriptors\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - PythonAnywhere Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nPython is full of amazing (yet often overlooked) features, that can help us write better, cleaner, and more maintainable code. One of them is the descriptors interface.\n\nBy means of descriptors, we can run code when accessing or setting properties of another object. This can have a lot of applications, and keeping descriptors in mind might come in handy when facing a hard problem.\n\nThe goal of the talk is to explore descriptors, and how they can be written, as well as analysing some interesting examples in well-known libraries or projects in order to identify scenarios where descriptors are the Pythonic way to go.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
