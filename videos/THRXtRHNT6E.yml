description: "One of the hottest technologies of late is no doubt Blockchain. But what is a blockchain? Put simply, a blockchain is a digital transaction of records that’s arranged in chunks of data called blocks. These blocks then link with one another through a cryptographic validation known as a hashing function. Linked together, these blocks form an unbroken chain — a blockchain. A blockchain is programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.\n\nStill confused about what can a blockchain really do? In this session, you will learn the fundamentals of blockchain, as well as learn how to implement Smart Contracts using Ethereum."
