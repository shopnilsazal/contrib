description: "RailsConf 2017: Accessibility (when you don't have time to read the manual) by Katie Walsh\n\nFor some, making web applications accessible is a must; Government websites fall under Section 508 and retail sites need to reduce legal risk.\n\nBut for others it seems like a luxury; Consultants are expensive, and so are the developer hours spent trying to parse the notoriously hard-to-read WCAG 2.0 docs.\n\nThere is an easier way to start!\n\nIn this session, we will demystify the WCAG 2.0 basics. Weâ€™ll use Chrome Accessibility Dev Tools to discover and fix common issues. You will leave with a set of free and easy-to-use resources to start improving the accessibility of your application today."
