description: "Steal This Talk: The Best Features Ruby Doesn't Have (Yet) by John Feminella\n\nOne of Ruby's greatest strengths is its burning desire to make writing software enjoyable for humans. Newer languages, perhaps taking some inspiration from Ruby, have recognized the practical value of doing this. What can Rubyists learn from these new ideas, and what can be adapted from them to improve Ruby?\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss a few of the most interesting Ruby-like features that aren't really in Ruby yet. We'll also show how you can get these features (or an approximation to them) with Ruby today. By the end of the talk, you should feel empowered to try them out yourself!"
