title: 'RailsConf 2015 - Getting a Handle on Legacy Code'
recordingDate: 1432134878
description: "By, Randy Coulman\nWe all run into legacy code. Sometimes, we even write it ourselves. Working with legacy code can be a daunting challenge, but there are ways to tackle it without taking on the risk of a full rewrite.\n\nThere is a deep satisfaction that comes from conquering a nasty piece of legacy code. The ability to achieve this goal depends on both testing and refactoring.\n\nWe'll learn how baby-step refactoring techniques lead to a better understanding of the code and a high-quality design while always keeping the code running."
