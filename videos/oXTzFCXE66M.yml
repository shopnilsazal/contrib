description: "Heard about the big Basecamp launch this March? Wondering what's new, how it's shaping Rails, and the tech behind it? We're going to go over some the practices and patterns in the new Basecamp's code base and you can learn how to improve your app with them.\n\nSome of what we'll go over:\n\nEmploying concerns to share code across models/controllers Stacker, the CoffeeScript component behind the \"page\" based layout Why polling for updates still works at scale Client side testing without the hassle Using jbuilder to keep view data out of models Keeping your team's sanity with a single setup script Debugging painful JavaScript performance slowdowns How to keep your app alive even if external dependencies like Redis are down Why tagged request logging and action/controller SQL query logging can make finding bugs easier\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGi9/"
