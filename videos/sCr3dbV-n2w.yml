description: "Panel: Ephemeral Communications: Why and How? \nRyan Lackey Founder, CryptoSeal, Inc. \nJon Callas Silent Circle \nElissa Shevinsky Glimpse \nPossibly more to come.....\n\nEphemeral communications applications are increasingly popular ways, especially among younger users, to communicate online. In contrast to “once it’s on the Internet, it’s forever”, these applications promise to delete information rapidly, or to maintain anonymity indefinitely, lowering inhibitions to share sensitive or personal content. There are several types of these applications, as well as ephemeral or anonymous publication use of mainstream tools, with unique security features and general utility. Key people from the major ephemeral applications will debate where the market is, where it’s going, and how these systems can best balance user desires with technical and legal requirements.\n\nRyan Lackey, Founder of CryptoSeal, founded HavenCo, the world’s first offshore datahaven, and has worked as a defense contractor in Iraq and Afghanistan, at various technology startups, and is currently working on a secure hardware-based router for business travelers.\n\nJon Callas, CTO of SilentCircle, is co-founder of PGP Corporation and Silent Circle.\n\nElissa Shevinsky, Founder of Glimpse."
