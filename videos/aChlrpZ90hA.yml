title: 'Ron Toland - Staying SAFE: A Foundation for Clojure Apps'
recordingDate: 1429647038
description: "Sonian's been using Clojure in production, at large scale, for 6 years. In that time, we've developed a common foundation for back-end Clojure services, embodied in our SAFE codebase.\n\nFor this talk, I'll walk through the major features of that foundation, explaining the reasons each was chosen and how they work together to make building new Clojure services easier."
