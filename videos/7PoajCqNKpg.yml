description: "If you admire SICP, you might have been intrigued by “The Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics,” by Sussman and Wisdom. This talk will serve as an introduction to the ideas and results in the book: how higher-order functions and a symbolic algebra system can represent Lagrangian mechanics, and more.. I’ll share a few of the things I learned bringing this system to Clojure, and show a few new tricks that can be done.\n\nColin Smith has a BS from Texas A&M back when they still taught Fortran. A copy of SICP fell into my hands years later and changed my life! Currently working at Google."
