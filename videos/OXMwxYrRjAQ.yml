description: "If you take the SOLID principles to their extremes, you arrive at  something that makes Functional Programming look quite attractive.  Objects are merely a poor man's closures. And ultimately closures are a poor man's objects. \n\nThis  talk explains about how applying SOLID Design principles like Single  Responsibility Principle (SRP) leads to many small classes. Furthermore,  if you rigorously apply the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP),  you'll eventually arrive at the ultimate Role Interface: an interface  with a single method. \n\nIf you apply the SRP and ISP like that,  you're likely to evolve a code base with many fine-grained classes that  each have a single method. \n\nObjects are data with behaviour. Closures too are data with behaviour. \n\nThis  talk will enlighten how applying Object Oriented Design Principles to  their extreme will lead you to Functional Programming. It's necessary for an Object Oriented programmer to understand why Functional programming makes sense.  This talk will also explain the essential basics of Functional programming needed for every Object Oriented Programmer."
