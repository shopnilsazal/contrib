description: "In this 2017 GDC talk, Maxis' Paul Rybicki explain how to make your UX designs more holistic and repeatedly referenced, so you can spend more time iterating and revising in each development sprint, while still keeping stakeholders from engineering, product or game design well informed of the current design direction and the game's design as a whole.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
