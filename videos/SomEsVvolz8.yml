language: English

description: "Rob Hirschfeld, RackN\n \nIn the cloud and container era, we’ve moved from managing systems over time to the create-destroy-recreate pattern commonly known as immutable infrastructure. These concepts are not just for containers and clouds, they can be simpler, faster and safer than traditional configuration in data center operations!\n\nWe’ll drill deep into these redeployment-based processes with examples, tooling highlights, and pragmatic pros and cons of this approach. We’ll also talk about taking immutable down to the metal.\n\nThis session is for experienced operators: we’re taking a system view and then going into the weeds.\n\nAttendees of this session will learn the following:\n\nUnderstanding of Immutable Infrastructure as part of a larger process\nRequirements to create your own Immutable Infrastructure deployments\nBenefits & Challenge of an Immutable Infra architecture\nApplying immutable to physical infrastructure\nDemonstration of Immutable Infrastructure using open source tools (time permitting)\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
