description: "This presentation is the screaming goat anti-forensics version of those ‘Stupid Pet Tricks’ segments on late night US talk shows. Nothing ground-breaking here, but we’ll cover new (possibly) and trolly (definitely) techniques that forensic investigators haven’t considered or encountered. Intended targets cover a variety of OS platforms.\n\nBio:\nint0x80 is the rapper in Dual Core. Drink all the booze, hack all the things!"
