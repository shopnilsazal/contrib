description: "KubeVirt - Kubernetes, Virtualization and Your Future Data Center [I] - Itamar Heim & Fabian Deutsch, Red Hat\n\nKubernetes is a great orchestration tool for containers, but why stop there? Containers and virtual machines are going to co-exist in the data center. Let’s re-envision our virtualization and cloud solutions with Kubernetes as a single underlying platform.\n\nWe’ll introduce KubeVirt - a project to converge the future data center using Kubernetes as its infrastructure. We will cover how we are implementing a caring and stateful environment to run pet VMs in containers on top of Kubernetes - without contradicting its core assumptions. We will also be discussing gaps and how we plan to tackle those, drawing on our experience with KVM and and caring for pet VMs (and cats) for many years. The session will also include a demo of how we are doing this today and where we want to go next.\n\nAbout Fabian Deutsch\nAssociate Manager, Red Hat\n\nAbout Itamar Heim\nRed Hat\nSenior Director, Software Engineering\nItamar Heim is a Senior Director of engineering for Container, Virtualization and System Management.
