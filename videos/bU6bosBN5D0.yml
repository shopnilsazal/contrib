description: "Ever dreamed of cleaning up at poker, but afraid that you are not good enough to do it on your own? Fear not! The chinese underground got you covered with high-tech concealed cheating devices that automatically read marked cards and whisper them in your ear through an ear-piece.\n\nSeems too good to be true? Well those James Bond devices are the real deal: we were able to get our hands onto one of those pricey gadget and they really work. They even come with additional gizmos, like a camera hidden in a key car, that would have made Q proud.\n\nCome to our talk to get an in-depth analysis of how those high tech devices work, see it in action and learn which techniques and tools we built to detect them so you don’t end up being the whale at your next poker game.\n\nBio:\nElie leads Google’s anti-abuse research, where he invents new ways to protect the company’s users against cyber-criminal activities and Internet threats. He recently worked on improving Gmail security, and made Chrome safer and faster by implementing better cryptography. Games hacking has been a long time hobby for Elie, who spends far too much time playing Hearthstone and Starcraft. He managed to turn his passion for games to Defcon talks and award winning academic papers. Born in Paris, France, Elie wears berets and love to do cards tricks when in good company.\n\nCeline Bursztein is the founder of PetSquare, a startup dedicated to pet owners and animal lovers. She’s crazy about animals and building a product about them was a great way to combine her biology and engineering skills (she holds a PhD in biology and a master’s degree in computer science). When Celine is not busy visiting every zoo on the planet or playing WoW, she picks every lock she can. She discovered this lock picking passion when she successfully cracked her father’s safe at the tender age of 7."
