description: "Elisha Tan, Founder, TechLadies\n\nTechLadies is a community-led initiative for women in Asia to connect, learn, and advance as programmers in the tech industry. Since our launch in 2016, we’ve taught 177 ladies in Singapore and Malaysia programming skills and saw 7 ladies getting technical internships or hired as junior software engineers. In this talk, I’ll share about the inspiration behind setting up TechLadies, the what and how of the programs we do, and the lessons learned on how to introduce more women to the tech industry. Hopefully it will be useful for you in increasing gender diversity at your workplace!\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
