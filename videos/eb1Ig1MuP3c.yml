description: "by Andreas Scherbaum (ads)\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nEver wondered what might be the best data type for a certain use case? Is itbetter to use INTEGER or BIGINT, and should you use TIMESTAMP or is it betterto use TIMESTAMPTZ? When is the last time you migrated a legacy database andwondered what to use as replacement for VARCHAR2 or CHAR(255)? How to store IPaddresses or geographical data, does that fit into VARCHAR or is theresomething more suitable?\n\nPostgreSQL 9.6 comes with around 40 different data types preinstalled. Thistalk looks beyond INTEGER and VARCHAR and dives into some of the lesser knownPostgreSQL data types. Use cases and examples show which data type is a goodfit for a certain situation.\n\n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 11:00:00"
