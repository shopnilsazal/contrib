description: "DevOpsDays Chicago 2016 - Leading an Enterprise to the Public Cloud by Brian Henerey\n\nI want to talk about the experience I've been a part of, bringing a large Enterprise company to using AWS for mission critical applications. This required collaboration across Development, Operations, Networking, Legal, Security, Audit, Risk, and Executive Management. Cross-team representatives worked together over several months, developed a written business case, and won executive backing to use AWS for mission critical services, including NPI data. I'll be sharing lessons learned along the way."
