description: "Warren Turkal, SignalFx\n\nSignalFx is an advanced monitoring platform for modern applications. It ingests, processes, and runs in-stream analytics against high volumes of high resolution metric data from all over the world.\n\nWe’ve use Salt from the beginning of SignalFx. In this talk, Warren will describe how SignalFx’s operating environment is organized and how Salt is used to turn it into an infrastructure product that can be easily consumed and used by engineers. For example, when service owners spin up a service or scale a service, no manual intervention is required. Warren will also go over some of the work he’s done to integrate Salt with AWS."
