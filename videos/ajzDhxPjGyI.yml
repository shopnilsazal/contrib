title: 'DEF CON 10 - Ofir Arkin - XProbe, The Year After'
recordingDate: 1392968141
description: "Ofir Arkin - XProbe, The Year After\nXprobe, written and maintained by Fyodor Yarochkin & Ofir Arkin, is an active operating system fingerprinting tool based on Ofir Arkin's \"ICMP Usage in Scanning\" research project (http://www.sys-security.com). Last year at the Blackhat briefings, July 2001, the first generation of Xprobe was released.\n\nThe tool's first generation (Xprobe v0.0.1) relies on a hard coded static-based logic tree. Although it has a lot of advantages (1-4 packets only, accurate, fast, efficient, etc.) the tool suffers from a major drawback - its logic is static.\n\nAt Defcon 10 we will be releasing Xprobe2, a complete re-written active operating system fingerprinting tool with a different approach to operating system fingerprinting. Xprobe2 rely on fuzzy signature matching, probabilistic guesses, multiple matches simultaneously, and a signature database.\nAs with the previous year - Don't miss the demonstration!\n\nOfir Arkin is the Founder of the Sys-Security Group (http://www.sys-security.com), a free computer security research body. Ofir has published several papers as well as articles and advisories. Most known are the \"ICMP Usage in Scanning\", and \"Trace-Back\" research papers. Some of his research was mentioned in professional computer security magazines. He is an active member with the Honeynet project and participated in writing the Honeynet's team book, \"Know Your Enemy\" published by Addison-Wesley."
