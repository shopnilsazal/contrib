description: 'Talking during GDC 2014, Valve''s Bronwen Grimes explains that when the company decided to add an economy to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, "we were faced with two huge challenges. First, we needed to create enough content to satisfy over a million players with only two artists. That part wasn''t so bad. Second, we needed to figure out what our players valued. Learn how we reduced our content creation time so that we could focus on design, and find out what we discovered about making an economy successful."'
