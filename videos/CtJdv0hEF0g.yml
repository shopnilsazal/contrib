description: 'A walk through the technologies required to create a VR simulation with user interaction inside a browser. My application uses the Leap motion Javascript API and plugin ecosystem to create a moving hand with bone rigging on a mobile device over WebRTC. The VR headset display is created using the Three.Js library to create a split screen stereo view for a Google Cardboard and the Device Orientation control plugin to tap into accelerometer data from a mobile device.'
