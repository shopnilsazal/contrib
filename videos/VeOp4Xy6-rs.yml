description: "Cloud service adoption is increasing across organizations, from startups to massive enterprises. Managing and auditing the security around cloud services is oftentimes difficult given the myriad of unknowns around connectivity and complexity. Weâ€™ve developed a completely mutable infrastructure for managing a traditionally critical piece of infrastructure, active directory identity management. This infrastructure eliminates many of the problems associated with traditional domain controller exploitation with ad hoc network routes, extremely restrictive access controls and the ability to destroy any complete domain controller compromise via automation technologies.\n\nWill Bengston\nNuna Health\nSenior Security Program Manager\nWill Bengtson is the punisher of security at Nuna Health and has been blowing cyber criminals away for years.\_ His experience across industries in low level implementation, architecture risk analysis, red teaming, and penetration testing among others has allowed him to partner up with the dark knight in investigations in cloud security and automation.\n\nRobert Wood\nNuna Health\nHead of Security\nRobert Wood is the dark knight of security at Nuna Health and has been fighting cyber crime for years.\_ Robert has experience with threat modeling, red teaming, incident response, static analysis, and penetration testing. Having been engaged in these capacities across many industries and business types.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
