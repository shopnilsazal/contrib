description: "Simulating the World with Ruby  by: Bryan Liles\n\nRuby is good for more than just making web pages and APIs. Its expressiveness makes it a good candidate for creating real world simulations. Out of the box, Ruby has some nuances that might make you think otherwise. In this talk, we'll review why Ruby is a great choice for creating simulations, and discuss hurdles and solutions for problems that you will run into. Topics include concurrency, domain modeling, testing, and more exciting topics."
