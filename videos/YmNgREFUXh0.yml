description: "In this 2015 GDC session, EA's Gurdarshan Dhillon discusses the importance of decoupling live content updates from the server deployment process. This was an extremely important step in FIFA's transition to Games-as-a-Service and it allows the content creation team to quickly react to real-world events and increase the timeliness of the game. \n\nRegister for GDC: http://ubm.io/2gk5KTU\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
