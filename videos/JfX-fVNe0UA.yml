description: "DEF CON 16 - Cameron Hotchkies: Under the iHood\n\nThe market share for Apple devices has grown considerably over the past few years, but most reverse engineering topics still focus on Microsoft platforms. This talk will outline what is necessary to begin reversing software on OS X. This will include a rundown of the tools available to an apple based researcher, how Objective-C works and what it looks like in a binary, the basics of the Mach-O file format including the undocumented _OBJC section and comparisons of Windows applications and the OS X counterparts.\n\nCameron Hotchkies has been a vulnerability researcher for TippingPoint's DVLabs since 2005. His day to day tasks include verification and analysis of Zero Day Initiative submissions, internal product security audits and a whole lot of reverse engineering. Prior to this he created the Absinthe/SQueaL automated SQL injection engine. He doesn't do web stuff anymore. Just reverse engineering. He holds a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering from McMaster University. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
