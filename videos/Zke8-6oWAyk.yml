description: "\"Reality is a graph, embrace it!\" Sure graph databases are really cool and have a timestamp dated next week, but do you know when you should actually use one? Sometimes living on the bleeding edge pays off and in this talk, I'll show you how you can simplify your application and model your data more naturally with a graph database. They are suited towards a specific problem that is actually quite common in today's applications and they may even apply to that thing you'll be working on during this talk!\n\nI will use Neo4j to demonstrate how to model graph data and integrate it with Rails. We'll start with the basics of graph databases, go over working in a polyglot environment, and get started on our first Rails app using Neo4j. The tools and practices learned here will not only dazzle your boss but make your life easier when you introduce a graph database to your application back home.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGi1/"
