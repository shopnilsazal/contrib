description: "In this talk Derek and Kirk will share with you how to test an app without a dedicated QA team, and this will be appealing to you if you’re part of a smaller development shops where formal QA hasn’t been established.\n\nThis talk is meant to be a higher-level overview into general QA process; it is not meant to be a highly technical dive into automation tools and unit tests. A general list of topics Derek and Kirk plan to cover are listed below:\n\nThinking outside happy path\n\nThinking about every entrance into a view both within the app and from outside app (deeplinks versus in-app navigation)\n\nThinking about different use cases; ie: someone in the app for a LONG time versus someone who opens it for 30 seconds once a day\n\nThinking about which devices are supported; size classes, OS levels, screen resolutions, hardware capabilities, etc\n\nThinking about externalities; network conditions, power levels, server endpoints 404’ing, null (or unexpected) data\n\nData persistence, data mutation, data stabilities\n\nUpgrade testing – different upgrade paths, Database migrations\n\nPermissions (Mainly Android M +)\n\nRepeated testing; ie: Verifying data race conditions aren’t an issue\n\nDeveloping an appreciation for Ad-Hoc testing (ie: Before release always have a feeling like you are missing something and take an extra 15 minutes)\n\nDeveloping a hatred for Ad-Hoc testing (non-rigorous testing)\n\nChecklists, and why you should use them\nIn this talk Derek and Kirk will share with you how to test an app without a dedicated QA team, and this will be appealing to you if you’re part of a smaller development shops where formal QA hasn’t been established."
