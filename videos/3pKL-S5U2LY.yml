description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #12\n25 February 2018\nSponsored and Hosted by Taboola\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nHave you ever been asked to implement some crazy idea? To scratch your right ear with your left hand? To solve a problem which intuitively should not be solved as a data science problem?\nThere are all kind of situations in which, as a data scientist, you may be asked to use your magic and find a solution for a problem that seems out of scope and very different from the problems you usually deal with. Whether those reasons are business constraints, customers demand, unavailable simple solutions, it all comes down to the same question:\nWould you accept the challenge? In this talk we’ll explore a real-world challenge and try to answer some questions that all data scientists should ask themselves when facing a new problem:\n- Does a “data science” approach make any sense for a certain problem?\n- What other alternatives are available?\n- How much time and resources should be spent?\n- What is the accuracy level that a good solution should reach?\n- How to reflect the difficulties to a non data scientist colleagues and managers?\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
