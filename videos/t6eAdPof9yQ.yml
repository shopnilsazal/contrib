description: "Agile Machine Learning for Recommender Systems\n\nWhat can data scientists and machine learning engineers learn from software developers? When it comes to process and tools, and managing complexity, the answer is: quite a bit. When we first started to deploy machine learning at if(we), it felt like we hit a speed bump in the middle of the highway. Accustomed to shipping software to millions of members multiple times a day, to constantly iterating toward better products, we were stunned at how long it took us to try new ideas using available machine learning tools. I will share what what weâ€™ve learned from applying agile software development principles to building recommender systems, describing the tools and platforms that allow us to go from new ideas to proven product improvements in just a few days."
