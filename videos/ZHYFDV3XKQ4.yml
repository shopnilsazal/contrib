Why were these old behemoths made, and how do they work again? Let's recall when to use Virtual Machines, and their best practices. Then we'll travel to the dawn of containers, exploring their conception, birth, and where we are today. Finally, wrapping things up with figuring out why were are here, right now, at KubeCon! We'll unwrap Container Orchestration, container runtimes, and the many acronyms buzzing around.\n\nAbout Sarah\nSarah has been virtualizing her environment since college, and has researched her way out of a VirtualBox. She is known for her outreach for Project Calico, a CNI open source project. She believes your infrastructure should be like a cat: agile and easy to take care of."
