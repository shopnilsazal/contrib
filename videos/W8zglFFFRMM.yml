title: 'RubyConf 2014 - Roda: The Routing Tree Web Framework by Jeremy Evans'
recordingDate: 1417796675
description: "Roda is a new Ruby web framework designed around the concept of a routing tree. Roda gives you the simplicity of Sinatra for simple cases, while being able to scale well to handle larger, complex cases. It provides performance very close to a pure Rack application, with a flexible plugin system powerful enough to handle almost any needs. Come learn about routing trees, how they make web development better, and how Roda adds a twist on the routing tree concept to avoid the scope pollution problem inherent in many other Ruby web frameworks.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FkBQ/"
