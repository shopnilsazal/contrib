description: "Luiz Eduardo: The Hacker Society around the (corporate) world.\nI will talk about the evolution and differences of the hacking communities around the world. Why and how this affects the hackers being taken to the corporate life, motivations, or just why is it better to stay totally underground. How companies attract and manage hackers, and how the scare them away. Computers are cool now, like the tshirt says, and small kids already know what ip addresses are, how to use netstat, etc. Is security gonna become a commodity? Come on over, let's talk about it. The more diverse the crowd is, the better.\n\nLuiz Eduardo, security engineer, paranoid sometimes, hacker, and overall, a good guy. Started a long time ago w/ applications, then all kinds of network technolgies, landed in wireless security for a while and now it's up for something new. Spoke at conferences in Mexico, Brazil and the US, wlan network guy for some security conferences (Defcon, Blackhat, CCC, Shmoocon, Layerone, H2hc, etc). Collects infosec certifications in the spare time and long flights in coach class while enjoying chicken or pasta."
