description: "DEF CON 16 - G. Mark Hardy: A Hacker Looks at 50\nTake a trip back in time and discover what hacking was like in the pioneer days -- before the Internet, the PC, or even the Commodore 64 or TRS-80. The speaker started \"exploring\" computer systems in 1973, when the only law about hacking was the hacker ethic itself. Join a humorous reminiscence about what it was like building an Altair 8800, \"discovering\" the 2600 Hz tone, storing programs on punched cards, cracking bad crypto, and more. You'll find the people and principles haven't changed, only the speed of the hardware.\n\nG. Mark Hardy CISSP, CISM, CISA, founded National Security Corporation in 1988. Since his first legitimate computer security job in 1976 for $2.10/hour, he has presented several hundred talks on information security. A perennial speaker at major security conferences, he's popular for his entertaining and informative style. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
