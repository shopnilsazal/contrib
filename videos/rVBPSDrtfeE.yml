title: 'Shift-Left: The role of the tester in a DevOps world by John Smart'
language: English
recordingDate: 1501623479
description: "In this talk, you will learn about the changing role of testing and test automation in the increasingly fast-paced world of continuous delivery and automated acceptance testing. Learn how, in a DevOps environment, testing activities start with requirements discovery and definition, playing a vital role in not only detecting defects, but preventing them, and ensuring not only that the features are built right, but the right features are built. And learn how test automation needs to happen during, not after, the sprint, and how you can achieve this.\n\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the role of the tester is not diminished with the arrival of automated DevOps, with its ultra-rapid deployment cycles and its emphasis on automation. On the contrary, testers play a vital role in ensuring that the code that gets deployed ten times a day is worth deploying."
