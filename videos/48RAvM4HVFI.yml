description: "I will start with a very brief theoretical introduction to the usage of factories and the dependency inversion principle. From there on, this is a live coding session where I will start from a properly architected app and show how it helps to do things such as reusing an existing use case in another view controller, or using a different backend, in case we are forced to do so (Any bitter memories?). I will also cover briefly how this architecture helps with testability. The goal is to prove that the benefits of a good architecture are very immediate and valuable.\nCome enjoy and spread the message within your team!\nWe usually hear about intangible or difficult to measure benefits of implementing a good architecture. I would like to prove to you that the benefits are far more mundane. In this talk I will showcase practical, real world examples of how a good architecture for your application makes your life easier. Using my interpretation of the Clean Architecture for Android in Kotlin, I will show how it helps to do things such as reusing an existing use case in another view controller, or using a different backend, in case we are forced to do so. I will also cover briefly how this architecture helps with testability."
