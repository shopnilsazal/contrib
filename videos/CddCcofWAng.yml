description: "Job Listing Minesweeper by Pamela Vickers\n\nThe technology realm is full of job listings ranging from blatantly terrible to simply excellent. The downright awful ones are not that hard to spot, while the ones that seize one's imagination and excitement are what drive learning and growth. But what about the ones that, on the surface, sound pretty good while hiding key elements wrapped within supposed \"perks\" or cultural ideals? These hidden red flags show the companies' actual culture and true values that may-or-may-not be quite so good. This talk will help a job hunter learn to be more discerning when reading job descriptions and how to spot and translate some of the common cultural assertions being made in less-than-obvious ways.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Gim4/"
