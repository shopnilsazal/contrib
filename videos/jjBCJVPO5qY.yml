Version 3 will be released before droidcon and brings significant changes and new opportunities for developers. In this session, the lead developer of EventBus gives you a look under the hood of EventBus to gain deep insights.\n\nEventBus is a proven solution for event-based communication for Android components like Activities, Fragments, and Services. By using a central event bus, components are decoupled and do not have to know each other. With its simple publish/subscribe API, EventBus saves time. Developers write less infrastructure and multithreading code, while the app architecture profits.\n\nEventBus V3 shifts to annotations. In combination with compile time indexing and code generation, performance was further improved. In addition, annotations allow a simpler API while introducing fine-grained control over event subscribers.\n\n[1] http://www.appbrain.com/stats/libraries/details/eventbus/greenrobot-eventbus"
