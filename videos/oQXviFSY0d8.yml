description: 'The Ragel state machine compiler is a fantastic, Ruby-friendly tool for building compilers, parsers and the like, and is used by many popular programs including Mongrel, Cucumber, and Hpricot. But despite its pervasiveness, Ragel has a reputation for being arcane and difficult to understand. Itâ€™s not. It is powerful, focused and to the point ( and also a lot of fun ). In this talk, two of the authors of Gherkin--the parser that powers Cucumber--will demonstrate the basics of language implementation with Ragel. Using behavior-driven development and at least two ponies, theyâ€™ll show you everything you need to know to get started developing software with Ragel.'
