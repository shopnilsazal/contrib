description: 'JavaScript is great, but let''s face it, being stuck with just JavaScript in the browser is no fun. Why not write and run Ruby in the browser, on the client, and on the server as part of your next web application? Don''t believe it, think its a crazy or an awesome idea, or think that it just plain won''t work? Drop by to learn about Google Chrome''s Native Client (NaCl) project which is aiming to allow web developers to seamlessly execute native code inside the browser. We''ll take a look at the motivating use cases, dive under the hood to understand how it all works, and also work through a functional example of running Ruby code in the browser!'
