description: "We spend all day communicating with people - verbally, nonverbally, on social media, over the phone, and in a myriad of other ways. But have you noticed that even though we are always connected to people, we aren't every really connecting with people? As a stutterer I know the struggle to effectively get your point across, especially in a time-crunched society. We as humans are rushed, rarely patient and generally in transit to the next thing. And I understand; I spend just as much time flying through the day as the next person. But I also understand the value of human interaction, and the fear that comes along with the idea of it. I've tried - and failed - at having meaningful conversations many times because of fear that I won't be accepted for who I am. But once I opened myself up to potential rejection, I ended up being accepted and celebrated for being flawed. Let's explore that fear together: the fear of reaching out, of real conversations and of willingly extending our hand to others looking to truly connect with us. Our weaknesses are often times great compliments to our strengths; it's time to be inspired to embrace vulnerabilities, empower our weaknesses and truly connect with the human beings around us.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Hbta/"
