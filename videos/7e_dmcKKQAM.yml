description: "\"Pandas - not just for data scientists\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - Anfiteatro 1]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nThis is not a tutorial. It's an attempt to expose non data scientists experienced pythonistas to the powerful pandas library. Most of python developers don't use pandas (either because they never heard of it, felt that it's a too steep learning curve or never thought that it will be useful for them). I intend to talk about python performance limitations and show how pandas can be used to overcome some of these limitations. The talk will be accompanied by a live Jupiter Notebook session that will demonstrate a typical use of pandas.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
