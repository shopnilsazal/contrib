description: "By Adam Rogers\n\nThis talk is about ways to hack your team for a more efficient, productive and ultimately happier existence. That's the good news. The bad news is hacking your team starts with hacking yourself.\n\nIn 1936, Dale Carnegie published a book called \"How To Win Friends And Influence People\". You may have heard of it. In 1989, Stephen Covey published \"The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People\". I was 6 years old.\n\nWhat can these old books (and others) teach us about working as part of a modern software team today?\n\nA hell of a lot, actually.\n\nWe'll look at some of the hacks, I mean techniques, raised in these books, and investigate how they apply in the modern software team.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4C/"
