description: "Every end collapse marks a new beginning. But where does momentum to start something new come from? Where does resilence originate?\n\nI want to tell you all my own story of personal resilience and how the best of things can come from the worst of situations. Or, how I learned to take power away from those who thrive on negativity and conflict and use it to create beautfiul movements of empowerment for those of us who deserve a better world.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG6W/"
