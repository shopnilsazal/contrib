title: 'Milos Miljkovic: Song Matching by Analyzing and Hashing Audio Fingerprints'
recordingDate: 1449251042
description: "PyData NYC 2015\n\nWe shall dive into the science of song matching using audio analysis and search algorithms in a database store. Python's rich scientific stack will be used for sound processing and hashing, and SQL database will serve for storing of audio fingerprints and matching unknown songs.\n\nAudio analysis coupled to SQL database store will serve as the basis of this talk. The audience will be introduced to the following concepts:\n\nNature of sound.\nDigital representation of sound.\nShort-time Fourier transform and spectrograms.\nAnalysis of spectrograms in order to produce audio fingerprints.\nHashing of audio fingerprints.\nBuilding of SQL database to store song audio hashes and meta-data.\nSearching of DB for matching unknown songs.\nCode for scraping YouTube for songs used in database building will also be provided to make following of the talk easier and provide a basis for the exploration of audio processing and DB creation.\n\nSlides available here: https://github.com/miishke/PyDataNYC2015"
