description: "ðŸ’– Support the show by becoming a Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/funfunfunction\n\nI want to talk a little about Misson Clarity today. What I mean by that is the importance of everyone in your team and organization understanding the *why behind your what*. Every single person in your team needs to understand not only what they are supposed to do, but also understanding what the intended outcome of it is.\n\nMission Clarity  is important in all organisations, but itâ€™s especially important in software development because the programmer at the keyboard, has so much more information than the leader. In software development, itâ€™s very hard to tell what is hard and what is easy, and the software developer is often the only one who knows. \n\nðŸ”—  Extreme Ownership (Book about Leadership)\nhttp://amzn.to/2kwlvrW\n\nðŸ”—  Why We Do What We Do (Book about Motivation)\nhttp://amzn.to/2lcXLsb\n\nðŸ”—  XKCD comic mentioned\nhttps://xkcd.com/1425/\n\nðŸ”—  mpj on Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/mpjme\n\nðŸ”—  The camera I use\nhttp://amzn.to/2kwlpAD\n\nðŸ”—  The microphone and sound recorder I use\nhttp://amzn.to/2kwli8e\nhttp://amzn.to/2lcVSfd\n\nðŸ”—  The lights I use\nhttp://amzn.to/2ld8jrX\n\nðŸ”—  Music: Peacock by 7 minutes dead \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi-xOhMqrkg"
