title: 'Kotlin''s hidden costs, revisited by Christophe Beyls, Dreamy Robots EN'
recordingDate: 1529097142
description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Christophe Beyls, Dreamy Robots.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-76\n\nKotlin has become the default modern programming language for many Android developers, with first-class support in Android Studio. But exactly how much performance and code size are we sacrificing for making use of all the additional features this language provides compared to Java?\nWe'll study the Java bytecode generated by the Kotlin compiler in various scenarios in order to find out which code constructs come with hidden performance penalties and learn how to become better Kotlin programmers. Some significant improvements in the recent versions of Kotlin will also be highlighted.\nThis talk is based on the series of blog posts from the speaker and extends it in some areas.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
