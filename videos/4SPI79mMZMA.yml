title: 'GeeCON Prague 2017: Aki Salmi - Live Coding: CQRS + Event Sources system'
recordingDate: 1516816492
description: 'CQRS (Command-Query Responsibility Segregation) is not anything new - it’s been a known for quite some time now. In the simplest form, CQRS only states that commands and queries are executed on different objects. Event Sourcing is a way to handle entity state as a sequence of events instead of the current state (and possible snapshots of the history). Often-heard complait about CQRS is that it introduces unnecessary complexity to a system. Surely, CQRS+ES systems do add quite a few classes/objects; messages; commands; queries; projections; events. But, all of those are themselves simple and often does only one thing, following Single Responsibility Principle. In this interactive talk, I hope to demystify most parts of the CQRS+Event Sourcing approach. In this live demo, we start with existing acceptance test describing a full use case (scenario) and already existing controller and repository layers. The coding happens ”one path at a time” showing how * to handle create a command in controller * to handle commands, logic touching multiple domain services / entities * to create an entity that is event sourced. * to create a projection that represents the state of an event at given time. The code exists in Github, with a separate branch for test-driving it oneself after the event. Code is written in Java, making the live programming easy to follow.'
