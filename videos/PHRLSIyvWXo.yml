title: 'How to Monitor Application Performance in a Container-Based World'
recordingDate: 1479335702
description: "How to Monitor Application Performance in a Container-Based World - Fabio Giannetti, Ken Owens, & Dave Roberts, Cisco\n\nApplication performance monitoring has always been a difficult problem for developers to implement, but it’s only getting harder. As application architectures shift to container-based microservices, the number of components typically rises and it becomes more difficult to understand how any given microservice is related to the total application performance profile. In this talk, we’ll discuss how Cisco developed a monitoring solution for Mantl, Cisco’s open source container stack based on Kubernetes. The solution leverages response-time data from Mantl and data from a number of open source projects, including Google cAdvisor, OpenStack Monasca, and Apache Kafka. We’ll discuss how we architected the solution, the features it provides, and why network traffic monitoring is critical when dealing with microservices.\n\nAbout Fabio Giannetti\nFabio Giannetti brings 16 years of experience to his role as Principal Cloud Engineer at Cisco where he spearheads work on the company’s containerized, microservices platform. Prior to Cisco, Giannetti held multiple senior engineering and research positions at Hewlett-Packard, first focused on printing technologies and later on cloud computing. Giannetti has contributed to the OpenStack cloud computing project and written for multiple ACM, IEEE, and other publications. He is an inventor or co-inventor on 10 patents. Giannetti holds a master’s degree in Computer Science Engineering from Università degli Studi di Genova, in Italy.\n\nAbout Ken Owens\nKen Owens is Chief Technology Officer, Cloud Native Platforms at Cisco. Ken is responsible for creating and communicating technical/scientific vision and strategy for Cisco’s cloud native technologies. He brings a compelling view of technology trends in enterprise IT (e.g. infrastructure, computing, SaaS, virtualization, and cloud) and evangelizes the technology roadmap for the business. Before joining Cisco in 2014, Ken spent over 7 years at Savvis as the Chief Scientist, CTO, and VP Security and Virtualization Technologies. Prior assignments include 5 years as a network security architect at A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., and Edward Jones brokerage firms in St. Louis, Mo, and 10 years in the design and architecture of communications systems and components for Erlang Technologies, Tellabs, and Wiltel. Ken holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering from Missouri University of Science and Technology."
