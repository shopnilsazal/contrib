description: "Are you from a non-C.S. background? What about someone you mentor? Many junior devs' top focus is building technical knowledge. However, they already have other skills that can help them in their roles immediately! Some of these include helping their team focus on the right tasks and working well with stakeholders like PM and support. This talk will discuss the non-technical contributions junior devs can make now and how their senior dev mentors can help them ramp up more quickly as a result.\n\nI studied Biology in college and was all set to attend medical school and fulfill my mother's dream of my becoming a doctor. Instead, I got a job at Google in tech support. After five years at Google, I took a sabbatical to attend Hackbright Academy. Now I'm a junior developer at New Relic.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0m/"
