description: "Creating an Arabic Programming Language! by Ahmed Abdalla\n\nInspired by Ramsey Nasser’s Arabic programming language Qalb, a functional, Lisp-style language, I created Noor, an Algol-based, imperative Arabic programming language. Arabic is my first language, and I wouldn’t have learned to program had I not moved to the US and learned English. I created Noor with the intention of it being a language for middle schoolers and high schoolers. In this talk I’ll share what I learned about creating an Arabic programming language and how Arabic text really works on your computer."
