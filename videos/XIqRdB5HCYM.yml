recordingDate: 1354389483
description: "Big data and data science have become hot topics in the developer community during the past year. This talk will show how ruby is used to build real data driven products at scale.\n\nData scientist Ryan Weald walks through the building of data driven products at Sharethrough, from exploratory analysis to production systems, with an emphasis on the role Ruby plays in each phase of the data driven product cycle.\n\nHe discusses how Ruby interacts with other data analysis tools -- such as Hadoop, Cascading, Python, and Javascript -- with a constructive look at Ruby's weaknesses, and presents suggestions on how Ruby can contribute more to data science in the areas of visualization and machine learning.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGen/"
