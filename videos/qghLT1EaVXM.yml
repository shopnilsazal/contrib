description: "Machine Learning (ML) is a key to develop intelligent systems. It has had some successes not only in data science and engineering but also in information security domain. While data gathered help in identifying threats, it only accounts for a small part of the whole picture. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to make sense of unstructured resources such as social media posts, online news articles and blog posts is what gives us the edge over the machines.\n\n===\n\nJim Geovedi is an IT security expert from Indonesia who focuses on the discovery of computer and network security vulnerabilities.
