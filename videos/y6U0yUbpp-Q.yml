description: "Caleb Hattingh\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/159/view_talk\nPython is very well-suited to implement GPS tracking services.  Devices need to report position data to servers, and Python handles this role well, especially with the new support for asynchronous event loops in Python 3 which can handle tens of thousands of simultaneous connections.  In addition, the struct module in the Python standard library makes short work of processing binary data supplied by devices. In addition to basic interaction with tracking devices, this talk will also present methods of integration (server) testing using py.test, as well as considerations regarding support for both UDP and TCP protocols in the same stack, since different GPS tracking devices may prefer one or the other."
