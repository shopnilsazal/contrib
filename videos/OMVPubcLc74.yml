description: "AppSec California 2015 - Day 2, Track 1, Slot 2\n\nTitle\n\nProactively defending your business against security protocol attacks and implementation flaws\n\nAbstract\n\n“HTTPS/SSL/TLS has been under fire for years. BEAST, CRIME, problems with the weakness of the CA system, problems with various versions of the protocol – and more – have plagued HTTPS to be less than satisfactory, at best, as a transport security protocol. Some of the most popular algorithms used to secure communications are getting close to their end of life. Proper protection of information in the upcoming years will require adoption of new technology and standards.\n\nRecent enhancements in browsers have made encryption in transit over the web viable for the first time in history and it’s imperative that everyone understand them. This presentation will start by reviewing some of the most recent cases related to security protocols flaws and weaknesses of cryptografic standards that should be proactively phased out. This pragmatic presentation will then discuss possible mitigations and their limitations, along with valuable implementation advice.\n”\n\nBio\n\nCassio Goldschmidt is a globally recognized information security leader with strong background in both product and program-level security.
