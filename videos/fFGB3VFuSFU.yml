description: "Beating Go thanks to the power of randomness by Tobias Pfeiffer \n\nGo is a board game that is more than 2,500 years old (yes, this is not about the programming language!) and it is fascinating from multiple viewpoints. For instance, go bots still can’t beat professional players, unlike in chess.\n\nThis talk will show you what is so special about Go that computers still can’t beat humans. We will take a look at the most popular underlying algorithm and show you how the Monte Carlo method, basically random simulation, plays a vital role in conquering Go's complexity and creating the strong Go bots of today.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H1VW/"
