description: "Eric Chien and Liam OMurchu, Symantec; Nicolas Falliere\n\nOn October 14, 2011, we were alerted to a sample by the Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The threat appeared very similar to the Stuxnet worm from June of 2010 [1]. CrySyS named the threat Duqu [dyü-kyü]  because it creates files with the file name prefix \"~DQ\" [2]. We confirmed Duqu is a threat nearly identical to Stuxnet, but with a completely different purpose of espionage rather than sabotage."
