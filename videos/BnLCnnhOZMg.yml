title: 'Jan Gray and Wolfram Schulte: On FPGA, Programming in the Large, and More'

description: "Hardware and software engineering/computer science greats Jan Gray (@jangray) and Wolfram Schulte (@WolframSchulte) discuss the rise of programmable hardware - FPGA - in the age of hyper-scale computing and machine learning. Other topics include programming in the large, consistency, the Facebook graph and keeping tree nodes up to date. If you don't know much about FPGA, you will after watching and listening to this. Incredibly exciting time for both hardware and software engineers!\n\nBoth Wolfram and Jan have a rich history at Microsoft: Wolfram as the originator of the MSR RiSE group and Jan being one of the founders of Visual C++. Jan has become a pioneer in the FPGA domain and recently worked with Microsoft on the Catapult project (see link below). Wolfram retired from Microsoft, quickly got bored with the analog world, and now works at Facebook working on programming languages after spending time learning deeply about data center design and even contributing to the Facebook client application. It was awesome to catch up with these two!\n\nThis is what happens when you see two titans talking in the hallway at an awesome PL event, then point them towards the video chamber, sit down, turn the camera on. Tune in. Enjoy!\n\n...Charles\n\n\nLearn more:\n\nProject Catapult:\n\nProject Catapult is the code name for a Microsoft Research (MSR) enterprise-level initiative that is transforming cloud computing by augmenting CPUs with an interconnected and configurable compute layer composed of programmable silicon. \nProject Brainwave leverages Project Catapult to enable real-time AI...\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-catapult/"
