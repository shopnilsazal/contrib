You are no longer limited to a screen, you now can interact with the world around you making it possible to create context aware experiences.\n\nIn this talk you will learn about all the possibilities that Android provides using BLE, both acting as a master, being able to connect to sensors and actuators around you, and playing as a peripheral, advertising packets and beacons for the world around you to see.\n\nI will share some tips and tricks learned from building a SDK for interacting with the WunderBar, a BLE enabled starter kit for the Internet of Things. Finally, I will explain how to make your connections secure and fast, and we will discuss some compromises we had to make to support iOS devices like as well."
