description: "Keynote - Runa A. Sandvik: Building a Culture of Security at The New York Times\n\n\nThe traditional approach for security teams has involved the existence of a siloed department, slow gatekeeping controls designed in a world of Waterfall development, and processes that aren't nearly as agile as they should be.\n\nThe New York Times has staked its future on being a destination for readers; the way we gather and report news is changing, so is the way we develop products. We, the security team, need to re-examine whether we're living up to our responsibilities and potential.\n\nThis talk will share practical lessons learned at The New York Times on how to build and foster a culture of security across the organization.\n\nAs part of this, the talk will also explore how we can adapt to better\nconfront the new challenges we face as security practitioners.\n\n\nRuna A. Sanvik\nRuna Sandvik is the Director of Information Security at The New York Times. Her primary focus over the past year has been the newsroom and helping reporters better understand the challenges they are facing. Runa loves to travel and has spoken at numerous conferences around the world.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
