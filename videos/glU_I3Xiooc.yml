description: "By Attila Domokos\n\nDo you have to look at Rails models with 2500 lines of code? Or 200 line methods loaded with iterators, conditionals and instance variables? Not only you, even the code author does not understand what's going on in there.\nI'll show you how you can craft simple and beautiful Rails application by adopting functional programming inspired ideas. Say goodbye to the mess you have by constructing tiny classes and functions that you can use to build up a complex system.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG9y/"
