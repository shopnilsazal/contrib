description: "DEF CON 16 - Mati Aharoni: BackTrack Foo - From bug to 0day\nAs pentesters and hackers we often find the need to create our exploits on the fly. Doing this always presents a challenge. But one challenge took us to a new limit and a new level. We want to share the method with you. From Bug to 0Day will show the audience the process of fuzzing, locating the bug, using egghunters then figuring out to build a pure alphanumeric shellcode to exploit it.\n\nThis will truly be the most mind bending 60 mins you will spend in exploit development.\n\nMati is a network security professional, currently working with various Military and Government agencies as well as private sector businesses. His day to day work involves vulnerability research, exploit development and whitebox / blackbox Penetration Testing.\n\nMati is most know for his role in creating the award winning, internationally acclaimed linux pentesting distro, BackTrack. As well as his lead role in creating the hottest security training school in the international market today, \"Offensive Security\". This focused, intense school hones the skills for security professionals by teaching them the tools and methodologies popular in the market. Mati has been training security and hacking courses for over 10 years and is actively involved in the security arena. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
