description: "RubyConf 2016 - Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto: Machine Learning with Ruby by Eric Weinstein \n\nMachine learning is a popular and rapidly growing field these days, but you don't usually hear it mentioned in the same breath as Ruby. Many developers assume that if you want to do machine learning or computer vision, you've got to do it in Python or Java. Not so! In this talk, we'll walk through training a neural network written in Ruby on the MNIST dataset, then develop an application to use that network to classify handwritten numbers."
