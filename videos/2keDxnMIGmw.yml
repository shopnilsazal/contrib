title: 'Andreas Schreiber: High Throughput Processing of Space Debris Data'
recordingDate: 1438885090
description: "PyData Seattle 2015\nSpace Debris are defunct objects in space, including old space vehicles (such as satellites or rocket stages) or fragments from collisions. Space debris can cause great damage to functional space ships and satellites. Thus detection of space debris and prediction of their orbital paths are essential for today's operation of space missions. The talk shows the Python based infrastructures BACARDI for gathering and storing space debris data from sensors and Skynet for high-throughput data processing and orbital collision detection."
