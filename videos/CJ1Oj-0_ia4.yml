title: 'Sumeet Sandhu & Tami Lee | Similarity Search in Patents via modern Artificial Intelligence'
recordingDate: 1472068744
description: "PyData SF 2016\n\nWe will describe our new Patent Management Tool built using modern Artificial Intelligence (Deep Learning) in Python. The AI generates data-based vocabularies used in ‘similarity’ search - allowing a one-click lookup of semantically related words that would otherwise be missed by the user. Preliminary results show that ‘similarity’ search outperforms the traditional keyword-Boolean patent search."
