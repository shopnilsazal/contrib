title: 'DEF CON 23 - Colby Moore - Spread Spectrum Satcom Hacking'

recordingDate: 1451054729
description: "Recently there have been several highly publicized talks about satellite hacking. However, most only touch on the theoretical rather than demonstrate actual vulnerabilities and real world attack scenarios. This talk will demystify some of the technologies behind satellite communications and do what no one has done before - take the audience step-by-step from reverse engineering to exploitation of the GlobalStar simplex satcom protocol and demonstrate a full blown signals intelligence collection and spoofing capability. I will also demonstrate how an attacker might simulate critical conditions in satellite connected SCADA systems.\n\nIn recent years, Globalstar has gained popularity with the introduction of its consumer focused SPOT asset-tracking solutions. During the session, Iâ€™ll deconstruct the transmitters used in these (and commercial) solutions and reveal design and implementation flaws that result in the ability to intercept, spoof, falsify, and intelligently jam communications. Due to design tradeoffs these vulnerabilities are realistically unpatchable and put millions of devices, critical infrastructure, emergency services, and high value assets at risk.\n\nSpeaker Bios:\nColby Moore is Synack's Manager of Special Activities. He works on the oddball and difficult problems that no one else knows how to tackle and strives to embrace the attacker mindset during all engagements. He is a former employee of VRL and has identified countless 0day vulnerabilities in embedded systems and major applications. In his spare time you will find him focusing on that sweet spot where hardware and software meet, usually resulting in very interesting consequences.\n\nTwitter: @colbymoore"
