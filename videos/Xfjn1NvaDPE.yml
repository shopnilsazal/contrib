description: "by Alok Anand\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nTelepathy Bell is a telepathy connection manager that enables a telepathyfront end for Ring. Ring is a privacy focused communication application thatuses a distributed peer to peer network for real time communications. In thistalk, I would like to share my experience while creating Telepathy Bell.\n\nThe idea behind Telepathy is to unify all communications. Severalcommunication services like IM, VOIP etc. implement their own desktop clients.This leads to duplication of effort and sometimes poor integration. Most ofthese features can be abstracted and their functionalities can be integratedto provide a unified user experience. A normal everyday user will use thetelepathy client application to communicate. This could lower the entrybarrier for many applications and make it convenient for the user to managecommunication services in a single client application.\n\nThrough my talk, I would like to share my experience during GSoC and beyond ofcreating a telepathy connection manager for Ring.\n\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 17:30:00"
