description: "João Santos - Using Git Hooks to Help Your Engineering Teams Work Autonomously\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nIn this talk, Software Engineer Joao Santos will describe how the\nengineering team at Zalando has been migrating to local Git hooks to\nensure that engineers can work autonomously and flexibly. Zalando---\nEurope’s leading online fashion platform for men, women and children--\nbegan shifting from SVN to Git in late 2013. Santos and his colleagues\nused Python to create a Git update hook that enabled the team to\nreject changes to a branch while still allowing changes to other\nbranches. He’ll explain why his team chose Python for this job instead\nof a bash script, point out mistakes made during the process (and\nsolutions his team used to fix them), and the benefits generated by\nthis migration. He’ll also talk about turnstile: a set of open-source,\nconfigurable, optional local Git hooks, created by the Zalando team,\nthat enables engineers to abide by internal rules for committing code\nwhile following their own coding style and workflow preferences."
