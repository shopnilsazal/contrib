description: "DevOps Parenting by Dawn Parzych\n\nThe more I learned about DevOps the more I realized how these principles could be applied outside of work, especially in my role as a parent. If you are a parent, thinking of becoming a parent or have parents learn how DevOps principles such as collaboration, communication and retrospectives can be applied to your relationships. This talk will frame some of the challenges of parenting through a DevOps lens."
