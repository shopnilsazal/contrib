recordingDate: 1438978506
description: "PyData Seattle 2015\nSponsor Talk- Dato\nThe future is one full of intelligence. Thanks to the practical application of machine learning, apps can now drive product recommendations, predict machine failures, forecast airfare, social match-make, identify fraud, predict disease outbreaks, and repurpose pharmaceuticals. These applications output real-time predictions and recommendations in response to user and machine input to directly create intelligent services and amazing experiences which result in tremendous business value. Iâ€™ll share our mission at Dato to accelerate the development of intelligent applications. There will be code and demos."
