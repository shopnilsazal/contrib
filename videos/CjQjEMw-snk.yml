description: "Writing High Performance Async IO Apps by Carl Lerche\n\nThe talk covers how to use MIO (a lightweight non-blocking IO event loop in Rust) to write fast IO applications with Rust. It will introduce MIO's network & timeout APIs and show how to use them to create a network server. The talk will then discuss some strategies for using MIO in a multithreaded environment.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Gx19/"
