description: "by Jim Huang\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nEmbedded system development is a complex area in which the developers need tohave a deep understanding of the underlying hardware with its configurationsand interfaces, and one of the solutions to reduce this complexity is toutilize an operating system. This talk will introduce F9 microkernel aimed atlow resources embedded systems powered by ARM Cortex-M microprocessors,allowing to perform real-time activities while keeping the drivers and theapplication isolated by a secure layer.\n\nF9 microkernel proved itself extremely small and simple to use while stillmaintaining the security of the system regarding the temporal constraints witha trusted computing base (TCB) as small as 3kLoC, which is important forsafety, security and reliability in mission-critical embedded systems. Thistalk will also present the prototype at its early stages built to experimentwith the idea of third-generation microkernels heavily inspired by seL4 forresource-constrained devices with fairly strong memory protection.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 14:25:00"
