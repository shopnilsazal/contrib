By understanding the power of apocalyptic themes and structures, Pinchbeck argues that developers can build better scenarios with a more integrated relationship between story and gameplay, which will lead to better games.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
