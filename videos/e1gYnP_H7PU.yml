As breaches and attacks become more and more sophisticated the responders need to continually re-examine their arsenal for new tactics and faster ways to process large amounts of data. Timelines and super-timelines have been around for a number of years but new software and techniques brings them back into play for Incident Response and live analysis instead of static postmortem forensics. Add in identification of anti-forensics techniques and you gain a whole new view on forensic timelines.\n\nGrayson Lenik is a Security Consultant at Trustwave and a member of Trustwave's SpiderLabs - the advanced security team focused on penetration testing, incident response, and application security.
