recordingDate: 1430319527
description: 'There is always an element of risk in trying to determine what is "fun" for a player. In this rare GDC 2004 video, Super Smash Bros creator Masahiro Sakurai discusses risk and return in both the Mario and Kirby series as part of a design lecture. (Apologies you can''t see his slides - this content was digitized from a video tape, and we''re in the progress of archiving, so we have yet to discover if his slides were also recorded.)'
