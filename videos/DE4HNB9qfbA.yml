description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/materials/ \n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT: \n\nHTML5 has empowered browser with a number of new features and functionalities. Browsers with this new architecture include features like XMLHttpRequest Object (L2), Local Storage, File System APIs, WebSQL, WebSocket, File APIs and many more. The browser is emerging as a platform like a little operating system and expanded its attack surface significantly. Applications developed in this new architecture are exposed to an interesting set of vulnerabilities and exploits. Both traditional vulnerabilities like CSRF and XSS strike back and powered by HTML5. In this paper we will cover following new attack vectors and variants of XSS and CSRF.\n\n** HTML5 driven CSRF with XMLHttpRequest (Level 2)\n** CSRF with two way attack stream\n** Cross Site Response Extraction attacks using CSRF\n** Cross Origing Resource Sharing (CORS) policy hacking and CSRF injections\n** DOM based XSS with HTML5 applications\n** Exploiting HTML5 tags, attributes and events\n** DOM variable extraction with XSS\n** Exploiting Storage, File System and WebSQL with HTML5 XSS\n** Layered XSS and making it sticky with HTML5 based iframe sandbox\n** Jacking with HTML5 tags and features\n\nIn this session we will cover new methodology and tools along with some real life cases and demonstration. At the end we will cover some interesting defense methodologies to secure your HTML5 applications.\n\nABOUT SHREERAJ SHAH\n\nShreeraj Shah, (B.E., MSCS, MBA, CSSLP) is the founder of Blueinfy, a company that provides application security services.
