description: "From AppSecEU 2014 in Cambridge\nhttps://2014.appsec.eu/\n\n\"Wait, wait! Don't pwn Me!\" is a live, security news game show that pits three security experts (Josh Corman, Chris Eng and Space Rogue) against each other in a game of wits. Host Mark Miller, selects topics from the week's security news, posing the news items as limericks, fill-in-the-blank, and audience participation questions. The panel competes against each other, and the audience, for speed and accuracy when answering the questions.\n\nDuring the AppSec USA 2013 Conference, this was a rollicking, high spirited session, exposing the prevalence of security issues highlighted in the main stream news. It demonstrates how hard it is to keep up to date with security updates, even for the experts. Audience members should come prepared as we test their knowledge against the panel, trying to determine what is real news and what is fake. \n\nThis is a fun filled session where panelists and audience members compete for prizes from the OWASP store. It is sure to put you in a good mood for the rest of the conference.\n\nSpeakers\n\nMark Miller\nCommunity Evangelist, Sonatype\nI run the OWASP 24/7 Podcast Series. Come and talk with me about your project and we'll see if we can get it on the show.\n\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
