description: "Open data at the local scale is even more of a mess than at the national level, but while there are increasing efforts to improve things nationally, cities, towns, counties, and even states are being left behind. These smaller entities don't have the resources to implement APIs for their data, and community tech groups and developers who want to use this data constantly hit walls — from fragmented, non-uniform data to finding API hosting and maintenance. But what if we could throw all that data in a box that’s easy to open, close, and move around — bypassing traditional solutions requiring infrastructure for hosting and maintenance. Enter Docker and ElasticSearch, and a simple three-layer API-in-a-box solution that any developer can immediately turn on with docker-compose up.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HKp6/"
