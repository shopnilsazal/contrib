description: "Jon Miller - Humperdink - Securing your Windows Internet Server\nI will show people how to secure different Windows servers using common sense and a variety of different tools. The fundamentals can be applied to any Windows server whether it is NT 4 / 2000 / .NET as well as IIS or Exchange. I will also walk people thru many good security tools that are a must have for any Windows server. I will actually secure a server at the talk that will later be placed on the CTF network. I will anounce a FTP location at my talk where all of the tools I will feature can be downloaded from."
