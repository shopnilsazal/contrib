Topics covered will be:\n\nThe Principles used when starting the initiative\nThe technical implementation of using Failed Customer Interactions (FCIs)\nThe dashboards and visualizations of the data\nThe culture change that occurred in the company as a result of the initiative\nThe tactical efforts needed to get momentum behind this new way of measuring\nThe bad ideas and mistakes we made along the way\nThe results and where we're at today\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
