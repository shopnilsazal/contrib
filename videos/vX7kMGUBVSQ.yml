description: "This week, James is joined yet again by friend of the show Matthew Soucoup, who shows us how to extend the built-in capabilities of any View in Xamarin.Forms with little gems of awesomeness known as Behaviors. Matt demonstrates what a Behavior is, and how these reusable classes can expand the Xamarin.Forms controls functionality without having to subclass controls or modify the code-behind files.\n\n\nShow Links:\n\nCode used in show: https://msou.co/9o\nDocumentation: Xamarin.Forms Behaviors: https://msou.co/9n\nReusable Command to Action Behavior: https://msou.co/9p\n\nFind James on Twitter: http://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno \nGitHub: http://github.com/jamesmontemagno\nBlog: https://montemagno.com\nand his weekly development podcast Merge Conflict: http://www.mergeconflict.fm\n\nNever Miss an Episode: https://twitter.com/thexamarinshow\n\nFind Matt on Twitter(https://twitter.com/codemillmatt), GitHub(https://github.com/codemillmatt), and his Blog(https://codemilltech.com/)"
