With Android 5.0 the Recents Screen was remodeled to become the Overview Screen which allows for more versatile multitasking. Apps using the new API can have multiple entries in this list, e.g. one per recently opened document, chat, or browser tab.\n\nThis talk shows developers how to modify their existing apps to make full use of these new platform features. Starting off by looking at some real world examples we then dive deep into the API. Different approaches will be discussed and the audience will learn how to avoid the most common pitfalls. In the end you should have all the necessary tools to modify your app to be part of the new and shiny world of document-centric Android."
