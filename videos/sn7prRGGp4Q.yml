description: "Bikeshed! Live! by Evan Phoenix and Adam Keys\n\nEveryone loves live coding! What's not to love about watching someone struggle through some trivial code while the audience corrects their every syntax error?\n\nThis session takes that to the next level by adding literal play-by-play commentary to a live coding session. Come and join us for what is sure to be a hilarious (and hopefully informational) trainwreck.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H0ph/"
