description: "For every enthusiastic attendee at a Ruby conference, there are a hundred people who have tried Ruby and walked away. There's also at least one person who's hit the top of Hacker News complaining about it. Are missing features or poor performance chasing people off? Is the community too international, or not responsive enough on GitHub? Maybe the problem is the ones who walk away — the inexperienced masses, poisoned by Flash, Visual Basic and PHP.\n\nLanguages and frameworks are interesting things. When you're choosing one, it's important to consider social information about your team — and the project you're evaluating — before making a decision. But while every README has bullet points listing the project's technical features, it's much more challenging to identify and extract the right social data to help that evaluation process.\n\nLet's bring this missing information into the light and look at social data from real teams, real projects and real extracted code. We'll make better decisions. We'll understand why Hacker News exists. Everyone wins! And you still don't have to do Flash.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG7m/"
