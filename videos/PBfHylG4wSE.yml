description: "Hybrid Cloud Powered by Kubernetes [I] - Aparna Sinha, Eric Brewer & Matthew DeLio, Google\n\nOpen Source Software (OSS) is great because it gives us freedom. OSS users by nature want to roll their own on premises, and use best-of-breed services in public clouds an without lock-in. Fortunately, Kubernetes runs everywhere so developers and operators don't need to learn new technologies to run hybrid and multi-cloud applications. \n\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate the use of two new extensibility features in Kubernetes to connect legacy on-premises applications and managed public cloud services with services running on Kubernetes in both places, creating an environment where users can have the best of all worlds. We will show the type of use cases this technology enables using examples from Google's cloud platform.\n\nAbout Eric Brewer\nEric joined Google in 2011 and leads the companyâ€™s compute infrastructure design, including Google Cloud Platform.  He focuses on all aspects of Internet-based systems including cloud computing, scalability, containers, and storage.\n\nAs a researcher, he has led projects on scalable servers, network infrastructure, IoT, and the CAP Theorem. He has also led work on technology for developing regions, with projects in India, Indonesia, and Kenya among others, and including communications, power, and health care.\n\nIn 1996, he co-founded Inktomi Corporation and helped lead it onto the NASDAQ 100. In 2000, working with President Clinton, Prof. Brewer helped to create USA.gov, the official portal of the Federal government.\n\nAbout Matthew DeLio\nMatthew DeLio is product manager at Google for Kubernetes multi-cluster, networking, and storage. He's also the PM SIG representative for storage. Prior to product management, Matthew was a software engineer at Google and has worked on search and platforms. He holds and MBA from the University of Chicago.\n\nAbout Aparna Sinha\nAparna Sinha leads the product team at Google for Kubernetes and Container Engine. She started and co-leads the community PM Special Interest Group (SIG) to maintain an open backlog for the Kubernetes project on Github. Aparna is currently a secondary member of the CNCF Governing Board. She has worked in enterprise software for 15+ years, and was formerly a Director of Product at NetApp. Aparna holds a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Stanford and has co-authored several technical papers during her research."
