title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2016 Julian Gamble - Distributing State over the Network in Clojure with Raft'
recordingDate: 1465570970
description: "In this talk and subsequent jam, you’ll learn about the power of the Raft consensus protocol for replicating state over the network. Using examples in Clojure, you’ll see how to apply this in the context of a multi-user multi-instance application. You’ll see how this has future implications for the use of WebRTC.\n\nJulian Gamble is a Software Engineer who has worked in the financial services industry for more than a decade. When he’s not enabling billions of dollars to orbit the globe, he writes and presents about all things software-related.\n\nJulian is the author of the book Clojure Recipes.\n\nFor more on YOW!
