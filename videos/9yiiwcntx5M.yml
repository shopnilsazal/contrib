title: 'Karaage Gardening by Brian May'
recordingDate: 1438658620
description: "Karaage is an open source Python/Django application for managing users and projects on HPC clusters. It is being used in production in a number of sites across Australia. This talk will discuss turning a messy legacy software base into a modern software platform that is much a cleaner mess (\"gardening\"). I will also talk about some of the lessons learnt along the way, including things that went well, and things that could have been handled better.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nJuly 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
