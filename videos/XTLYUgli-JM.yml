description: "by: Piotr Szotkowski\n\nRuby is â€˜known to be slowâ€™ â€“ but what does that exactly mean, does it really matter, and â€“ more importantly â€“ what can we do about this?\n\nThis presentation, based on hands-on experience of using Ruby for scientific computations, shows how to profile Ruby applications (including webapps), how to interpret the results and what to do with the bottlenecks â€“ from algorithmic optimisation through using dedicated libraries to rewriting them (in place!) in â€˜fasterâ€™ languages."
