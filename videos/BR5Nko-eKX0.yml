recordingDate: 1500906036
description: "This talk will cover how to make millions of time series forecasts in an automated fashion. We will be covering helpful heuristics to inform preprocessing, tradeoffs between contextual evaluation metrics (and meta-metrics), useful libraries for employing different forecasting techniques in Python and R, and how to choose the best hardware for forecasting given cost and runtime constraints.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
