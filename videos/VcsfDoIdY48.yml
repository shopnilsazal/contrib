description: "Twitter is one of the largest companies in the world running Ruby, and you can tell by its agile culture: fast, iterative development that finds a balance between people and process.\n\nThis presentation starts with a high level overview of Twitter's architecture, following a tweet from desktop to delivery on your mobile phone. Then we'll dive into specific Ruby apps, including mobile.twitter.com and the SMS delivery service. Finally, we'll cover the best practices that allow small teams to consistently deliver quality work.\n\nBenjamin Sandofsky is an engineer on Twitter's mobile team. He works on mobile.twitter.com, Twitter for iPhone/iPad, Tweetie for Mac, and Twitter for Safari.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FNkD/"
