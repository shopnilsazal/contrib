description: 'How can we improve our professional practice as programmers? What can we learn from the creative processes in fine art? The talk will be based around one womanâ€™s experience of coming into programming from a training in sculpture. Looking at planning, process and evaluation within the discipline of fine art, what can we learn and apply to software development? Can these approaches improve our own processes and lead towards a more fulfilling and successful career in development?'
