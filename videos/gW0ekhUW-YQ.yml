description: "by JÃ¶rg Steffens\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nBareos (Backup Archiving Recovery Open Sourced) is a reliable, cross-networkopen source software for backup and recovery of data for a large set ofoperating systems (Linux, Unix, Windows, MacOS). Bareos offers a lot of toolsfor user interaction. The best known tool is the bconsole, offering a commandline interface. While it offers a lot of functions and can also be scripted,the Bareos JSON backend is much easier parse-able, especially when using thebareos-python module.\n\nThis presentation will show, how Bareos can be scripted. It will give aoverview about the existing tools (bconsole, bls, bscan, bareos-dir, ...),with special focus to the Bareos Console. It will show the Bareos Consolefeature, like commands, ACLs, JSON backend and scripting abilities. Especiallyfor the JSON backend, we show how this can be accessed by the python-bareosmodule.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 15:45:00"
