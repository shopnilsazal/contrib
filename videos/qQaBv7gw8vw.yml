description: "Filmed at PyData London 2017 \n\nDescription\nI will show the tools and processes for building interactive web apps using the Jupyter stack. Simple, easy, beautiful.\n\nAbstract\nJupyter is great for tinkering and research. But what if you are not the only consumer of that notebook? What if other consumers want to slice and visualise your data differently? I will show how to turn fresh ideas or existing Jupyter notebooks into beautiful web apps without the need to worry about the web server, HTTP and content deployment.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
