description: "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nIoT adoption is raising, together with the number of other types of scenarios, where high-performance streaming analytics becomes a critical component. In this tutorial we focus on the capabilities of structured streaming in Apache Spark, for building so-called continuous applications in the cloud. Microsoft Azure is used as the running platform.\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
