description: "Making the GAFAs obsolete Decentralizing the servers with the personal cloud approach. Introduction to the Personal Cloud and Self-data approaches: having your own open-source server, handling your own data locally, with innovative services\nby Tristan Nitot\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nSurveillance: the case for personal Cloud and against GAFAMs\n\nThe concept of Personal Cloud\n\nDemonstrating a personal cloud instance and its innovative usage.\n\nMost of the Western population now uses 3 different kinds of computers: PCs,smartphones and Cloud services. Where is the room for Open Source and FreeSoftware in this new world? Software freedom is possible on the PC side, it'salready quite challenged on the smartphone world, and too little is being doneon the Cloud side. A lot of Cloud services run on open source software, butoffer in the end proprietary services that centralize user data. As EdwardSnowden's revelations have demonstrated, all of this makes mass surveillanceeconomically possible.\n\nWhat do we do as a community to avoid mass surveillance? What alternative dowe build?\n\nOne possibility is the Personal Cloud movement, where a server (self-hosted ornot) runs a platforms that enables personal data collection through connectorsin order to run innovative apps relying on that personal data.\n\nDuring this short presentation, we'll see how data centralization leads tomass surveillance and how a personal cloud works.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 08:00:00"
