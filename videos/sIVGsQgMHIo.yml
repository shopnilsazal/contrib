title: 'RubyConf 2014 - Build the Unified Logging Layer with Fluentd and Ruby by Kiyoto Tamura'
recordingDate: 1417796525
description: "As software becomes less monolithic and more service-oriented, log collection becomes a real problem. How can we stop hacking together brittle log parsing scripts and start building a unified logging layer?\n\nFluentd is a data collector written in Ruby to solve this problem. Unlike other log management tools that are designed for a single backend system, Fluentd aims to connect many input sources into several output systems.\n\nThis talk surveys Fluentd's architecture and shows real-world use cases of how different users extend it to do more with their logs with less code.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FkBP/"
