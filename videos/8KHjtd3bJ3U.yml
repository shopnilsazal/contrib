description: "Max Tepkeev - How we switched our 800+ projects from Apache to uWSGI\n[EuroPython 2014]\n[23 July 2014]\n\nDuring the last 7 years the company I am working for developed more than 800 projects in PHP and Python. All this time we were using Apache+nginx for hosting this projects. In this talk I will explain why we decided to switch all our projects from Apache+nginx to uWSGI+nginx and how we did that.\n\n-----\n\nThe talk will start from describing the setup we had for the last 7 years, i.e. Apache with mod_wsgi for Python projects and mod_php4/5 for PHP projects + nginx. I will explain why we used this setup for so long time, what problems we faced with this setup and what solutions we tried to solve them before switching to uWSGI.\n\nThen I will tell about uWSGI, what it is, how it works and what features it has. I will show the comparison of configuration files, how simple it is to configure uWSGI compared to Apache.\n\nLastly I will explain how we managed to switch all our 800+ projects developed over the years in 2 different languages with 2 major versions changed (PHP4/5 and Python2/3), how this switch simplified our development and administration of this projects, the improvements we got in memory management and other areas.\n\nOf course I will concentrate mainly on our Python projects because it is EuroPython after all and not EuroPHP ;-)"
