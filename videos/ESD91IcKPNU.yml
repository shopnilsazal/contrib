description: "Somewhere down the line, sales got a bad wrap. People began to see it as a way of tricking others into consuming something they do not need or want. That is wrong. Sales is about identifying needs and finding solutions that fit both parties. Everyone needs to understand sales, but many of us do not realize this. Understanding how to get your point across, or how to frame an issue clearly and understandably helps us in discussions with bosses, current clients and prospective clients. In this talk, I will walk you through the basics of sales. I'll show you how I have applied what I know about sales to help my bosses see why certain technologies should be used, convince my customers to team up with us to realize their visions and convince my wife to let me get an iPad.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GXlS/"
