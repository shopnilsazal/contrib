recordingDate: 1510873331
description: "More and more businesses are requiring developers to own end-to-end delivery, including operational ownership. In this webinar, Alexis Richardson (CEO, Weaveworks) will take you on a journey of discovery into the world of GitOps. Alexis will share with you what it means, and how easy it is to create cloud native applications, CICD pipelines, integrate operations and more, using GitOps.\n\nInherited from best practices going back 10-15 years, cloud native is making these practices more relevant today. At Weaveworks, their experiences are based on operating a full CNCF stack in anger for nearly two years. This includes continuously updated Kubernetes, Prometheus, Fluentd, OpenTracing, and more. Alexis will showcase best practices and tools, including some of Weaveworksâ€™ use cases."
