description: "Brianna Laugher - The realities of open source testing: lessons learned from “Adopt pytest month”\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nEver feel like your open source project could be better tested? Lack\nof tests holding you back from contributors but you don’t know where\nto start? You’re not alone.\n\n[“Adopt pytest month”][1] was held in April 2015. [Pytest][2] volunteers were paired with open source software projects, to find a path to better testing with pytest. Projects varied from  libraries/command line utilities, to a browser, to a complex Django app. In some cases converting existing tests was necessary, in others writing the first tests in existence for non-trivial amounts of code. Two projects were open sourced specifically to take part in “adopt pytest month”. What began as an experiment in increasing software audience proved to be an interesting exercise in strengthening community and most valuable of all, provided a newcomer’s perspective to veteran contributors.\n\nThis talk will discuss what worked well with “adopt pytest month”,\nwhat didn’t, what we learned about pytest and what you could take away\nfor your open source project, be it an improved testing environment or\nan improved contributor community. A basic knowledge of testing and\npytest will be useful.\n\n[1]: http://pytest.org/latest/adopt.html\n[2]: http://pytest.org/latest/"
