description: "Mythrandir - Penetrating B1 Trusted Operating Systems\n\nIf you have attended the Newbie B1 talk, or have previous experience with B1 systems then you will find this talk enlightening. Typically, B1 systems can only be penetrated due to misconfigurations. We will take a whirlwind tour of all of the areas to check for security misconfigurations and develop a methodology for attacking B1 Trusted Operating Systems. You are going to find B1 Trusted Operating Systems in increasing use, and you owe it to yourself to understand how to penetrate these systems and how to lock them down.\n\nMythrandir, Software Evangelist and Visionary, Argus Systems Group, Inc. \n\nDEF CON 8.0 was held July 28th - 30th, 2000, in Las Vegas, Nevada USA"
