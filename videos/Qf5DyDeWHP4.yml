title: 'Jakub Kauny Slawomir Jasek - Shameful Secrets of Proprietary Network Protocols'
language: English
recordingDate: 1404482402
description: "From AppSecEU 2014 in Cambridge\nhttps://2014.appsec.eu/\n\nThere is a big bunch of tools offering HTTP/SSL traffic interception. However, when it comes to penetration tests of specialized embedded software or thick clients, we often encounter proprietary protocols with no documentation at all. Binary TCP connections, unlike anything, impossible to be adapted by a well-known local proxy. Without disassembling the protocol, pentesting the server backend is very limited. Though, based on our experience, it very often hides a shameful mystery - completely unsecured mechanisms breaking all good coding practices.\n\nWe would like to present our approach and a short guideline how to reverse engineer proprietary protocols - a world full of own implementations of asymmetric cryptography, revertible hash algorithms, lack of user authentication and no function or data access control at all.\n\nTo demonstrate, we will show 5 case-studies - most interesting examples from real-life financial industry software, which in our opinion are aquintessence of \"security by obscurity\". We will talk about homeautomation, embedded pull printing software in multifunction printers (MFP), remote desktop protocols and twisted vulnerabilities in FOREX trading software, which is particularly risky business regarding security.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\nSlawomir Jasek\nIT security consultant with over 10 years of experience. Participated in | many assessments of systems' and applications' security, for leading | financial companies and public institutions, including a few dozen | e-banking systems. Currently focuses on consulting design of secure | solutions for various projects during all the phases - starting from a | scratch. For 8 years has been working with SecuRing.\n\nJakub Kałużny\nIT security specialist at SecuRing where he consults all phases of SDLC, | specialized in penetration testing of high-risk applications and | proprietary network protocols. Speaker at many ITsec conferences - | PHDays, HackInTheBox, CONfidence. Former European Space Agency intern, | web developer and bug bounty hunter. | |\n\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
