description: "Welcoming People (and Other Hard Problems) by Tute Costa\n\nWe interact with people in chat rooms, issue trackers, pull requests, discussion boards, meetups, hallways, or conferences.\n\nHow do we provide feedback constructively? Are we perceived as friendly as we think we are? How exactly do our cognitive biases unconsciously affect our human interactions? How do we become conscious of them? What assumptions does our language carry?\n\nEffective communication is critical particularly for project leaders. As leaders, we open the doors to our gardens, and the first interactions define the tone for the group, shaping today's atmosphere as much as tomorrow's. In this talk, we'll explore how to communicate effectively. Always, and with everyone.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HOAZ/"
