description: "In this 2018 GDC panel, designers Raph Koster, Dave Mark, Richard Lemarchand, Laralyn McWilliams, Noah Falstein & Robin Hunicke discuss what problems they wish artifical intelligence could solve for them when making games. These concepts include character AI, procedural content, animation, speech, or \"director\"-style pacing and content delivery. The panel doesn't necessarily focus on the practical of \"what can we do\" but explores \"what COULD we do,\" with the intent to give AI programmers ideas for what could be implemented in game design. \n\nRegister for GDC: http://ubm.io/2gk5KTU\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
