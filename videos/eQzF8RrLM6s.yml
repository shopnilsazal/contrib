description: "F# is a rich, expressive, general purpose, functional first language designed with the goal of allowing developers to write simple code to solve complex problems.\nWhile The Book of F# provides a comprehensive tour of the language this session will focus on several of the primary ways F# accomplishes that goal. In just 60 minutes we'll discuss what it means to be functional-first, the advantages of the functional-first paradigm, and several key language features including curried functions, partial function application, record types, discriminated unions, pattern matching, units of measure, type providers, and computation expressions."
