description: "by Evan Schwartz\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nWhat if you could send money to anyone, instantly, in any currency andpractically for free? What if users could support your project with tinyamounts of money each time they use it? What if we could use anything of valueas \"currency\" and have it automatically exchanged when we want to make apayment?\n\nInterledger is the inter-networking protocol for money. It enables securetransfers across different currencies and payment networks. By connecting alldifferent types of payment networks or ledgers together, Interledger can helpcreate an \"Internet of Value\".\n\nThis talk will include a demo of an Interledger payment, a technical overviewof how it works, and examples of how Interledger can be built into otherprojects.\n\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 15:00:00"
