recordingDate: 1266158425
description: "By Greg Kroah-Hartman\r\n\r\nAs A core member of the Linux Kernel team, Greg will show us how to write a kernel patch.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover the steps necessary to properly compose, describe, and submit a Linux kernel patch. It will cover the basic usage of git, and how that works with the Linux kernel development cycle. Attendees should have a solid grasp of the C language, and know how to build and install, a Linux kernel from scratch (if not,reading the book, Linux Kernel in a Nutshell, free online, ahead of time would be a very good idea.)\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
