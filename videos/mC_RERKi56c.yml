Jointly with David Ketcheson and Mauricio del Razo, we are developing the book as a series of Jupyter notebooks that include Python code for the reader to experiment with, and that employ interactive widgets and animation tools to provide a more active experience for students or researchers grappling with this theory. We are still experimenting with the best approach to developing material that works well in the notebook and also translates well to static webpages and hardcopy, with the hope of expanding its accessibility and usefulness. The current state of the project can be found in the Github repository https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
