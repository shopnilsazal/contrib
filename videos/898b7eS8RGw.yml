description: "Niall Richard Murphy, Google\n\nWhether a cause or a consequence of diversity & inclusion problems, members of minority groups in SRE experience harassment, bullying, and anti-social exclusion far too often. Although primarily an ethical and behavioural issue, it also has extremely costly negative effects on team effectiveness, arising from loss of psychological safety and even attrition. The data supporting these assertions are reasonably clear, but what is perhaps less clear is what to do about it.\n\nWe therefore analyse the situation in the form of a postmortem, suggesting some root causes, presenting a timeline, and analysing factors which contributed to (and offset) The Incident, and propose some actions to remediate.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
