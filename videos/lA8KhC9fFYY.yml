title: 'Ruby On Ales 2015 - Better APIs with Pliny'
recordingDate: 1427224588
description: "By, Will Leinweber\nHeroku started out as single, large Rails app. Over the years it split into countless (really ... I have no idea how many) smaller services. Some of these splits were very successful, and others not so much. Pliny—an API framework built on Sinatra—distills everything we've learned the hard way about building production APIs in Ruby. Pliny takes care of mundane, mechanical decisions like logging and configuration, but also service problems including API versioning and json schemas. Most importantly, it comes with patterns to manage complexity as the service grows. It also shares its name with fantastic beer from Russian River. In this session, we'll explore what's important as you split into services, but also what can go terribly wrong. You'll learn everything you need to get started yourself with Pliny by looking at an open-source microservice built with it.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GUQJ/"
