description: "Implementing Rails 3.1, Backbone.js, CoffeeScript, jQuery, Sass, and CouchDB on EC2 by: Rod Cope\n\nIn under two months, my team: * Learned all about Rails 3.1, Backbone.js, CoffeeScript, Sass, and CouchDB * Wrote a new application that deploys open source stacks in the cloud * Created some stacks (e.g., Rails, Tomcat, BIRT) * Went to production on Amazon EC2\n\nCome to this session to see what went right, what went wrong, and how this all compares to one of our other production stacks based on Rails 2.3, JavaScript, jQuery, Redis, and MySQL. In particular, you'll learn how to take advantage of some hot new tools while avoiding many of their pitfalls."
