description: 'Although Python programs may be slow for certain types of tasks, there are many different ways to improve the performance. This tutorial will introduce optimization strategies and demonstrate techniques to implement them. Another objective of this course is to help the participants to gain the ability to decide what might be the optimal solution for a specific performance problem. Abstract This is a hands-on course. Students are strongly encouraged to work along with the trainer at the interactive prompt. There will be exercises for the students to do on their own. Experience shows that this active involvement is essential for an effective learning.'
