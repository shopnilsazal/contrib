description: "Storytelling via the Psychology of Professional Wrestling by David Copeland\n\nGreat storytelling feels almost impossible at times, yet week in and week out, for over 30 years, the jacked-up men & women of World Wrestling Entertainment have been doing it, five minutes at a time.\n\nNo back-story, little dialog, and a live crowd that knows it's all scripted. Yet, they get the audience invested in the outcomes almost every time.\n\nSound impossible? Pro-wrestlers know the essence of great storytelling—called “ring psychology”—and have used it for decades."
