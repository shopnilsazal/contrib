description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - In 1985 an Italian plumber named Mario changed the world. Elegant Mechanics, Level Design, Fine-tuned Controls... A standard was born for what video games should be. Game Design went from Alchemy unknown to many, to pseudo-Science with clear rules. 28 years later, "Gone Home" is released on Steam. The game features no challenge. No levels. No real "gameplay mechanics". No game over. And certainly, no Italian plumbers! A pragmatic look at a new era of Game Design, from the Lead Designer of “Last Day of June”.'
