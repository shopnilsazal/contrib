description: "\"Making Games with Python: Mission Impossible?\n[EuroPython 2017 - Panel - 2017-07-11 - Arengo]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nA discussion about making full-featured, commercial games in python, both 2D and 3D.\n\nLooking at state of the art approaches to using python in gaming, we will compare the alternatives: pygame (2D API), OpenGL (via pygame/pySDL2), Unreal Engine 4 and the Godot Engine (with further comparison to Unity 3D game engine).\n\nWe will also look at other benefits of using python in the gaming context, such as integration with 3D modelling software, scripting the asset pipeline and GIS data integration.\n\nFinally, can (and should) python move beyond being the language of plugins and scripts, and become the main language for creating game development projects?\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
