title: 'Searching for Truth, or at Least Data: How to Be an Empiricist Skeptic'
recordingDate: 1282255417
description: "Talk given by Elizabeth D. Zwicky at the 23rd Large Installation System Administration Conference (LISA '09).\n\nWhat do software testing, security, and successful project planning have in common? They all require the same outlook. Call it \"skeptical empiricist,\" call it \"man from Missouri\" (the Show Me state), call it data-driven, but whatever you call it, it involves looking beyond claims and guesses and trying to figure out what the facts are. This talk will provide you with tools and advice on how to find data and make sense of it, plus of course inspiring tales of triumph, disaster, and comedy revolving around the search for facts."
