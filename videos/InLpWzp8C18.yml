recordingDate: 1479335546
description: "PostgreSQL on PetSet - Josh Berkus, Red Hat\n\nNow that we have PetSet, let's deploy some databases on it!  Version 1.3's PetSet was designed to answer a lot of the needs of people deploying databases and other stateful services on Kubernetes.  In this talk, we'll demonstrate how to use PetSet features in order to support deploying both single-master and clustered PostgreSQL.  As a bonus, these database applications will be deployed to my portable micro-cluster.\n\nAbout Josh Berkus\nJosh works on Project Atomic at Red Hat, but is better known for his long work on the PostgreSQL Project.  His passions are databases, containers, devops, cooking and pottery."
