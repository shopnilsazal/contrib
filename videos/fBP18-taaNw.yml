description: "Git has quickly become an incredibly popular version control system, but how does it actually work? It's very different from a centralized version control system, and understanding how it models history allows you to understand how to use it.\n\nEdward Thomson explains how Git actually works under the hood, the fundamentals of a repository, and how this makes Git fast and flexible."
