recordingDate: 1431454501
description: "by Stan Ng and John Phamvan\n\nPayoff has a crazy goal; we want to solve America’s credit card debt problem. After a risky 8-week Ruby rewrite of our 500k line C# personal finance website, we decided that wasn’t audacious enough. So we set out to become a financial institution in order to help folks get out of credit card debt. In the past 16-months, we taught the rest of the engineers Ruby, figured out how to lend money, wrote all the systems and automation needed for a small bank, and hired 70 more super nice people to make it real. If you have a crazy goal to change the world, come listen to our story."
