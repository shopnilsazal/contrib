description: "Brook Shelley, Turbine Labs\n\nSoftware releases are often costly, slow, and difficult to roll back. This talk will suggest a different way forward with a flexible, incremental, reversible release workflow using tools like a reverse-proxy and customer-centric monitoring. I'll also talk about header and cookie based dev branch tests, and ways to use an incremental release to test internally as well. There will be a short demo of a release gone bad, and one that succeeds, in order to illustrate the principles of this talk. There are some blinky lights, but not many.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
