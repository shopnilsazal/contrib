description: "Shall We Play A Game? by Randy Coulman\n\nTeaching computers to play games has been a pursuit and passion for many programmers. Game playing has led to many advances in computing over the years, and the best computerized game players have gained a lot of attention from the general public (think Deep Blue and Watson).\n\nUsing the Ricochet Robots board game as an example, let's talk about what's involved in teaching a computer to play games. Along the way, we'll touch on graph search techniques, data representation, algorithms, heuristics, pruning, and optimization.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H0nI/"
