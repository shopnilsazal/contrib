description: "Steven Alexander- Firewalls: Trends and Problems.\n\nThis talk will cover some of the new firewalling trends and how many of them are detrimental to security. The focus of this talk will be on how the discussed trends work and how they can be used by an attacker to defeat security, and how security problems can be avoided. The discussion will not cover specific products in order to allow anyone to apply the subject matter\nto their current configuration.\n\nSteven works for a small ISP, attends his local college as a math major and spends his free time studying cryptography. \n\nDEF CON 7.0 was held July 9-11th, 1999, in Las Vegas Nevada USA"
