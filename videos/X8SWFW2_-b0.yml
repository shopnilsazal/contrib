recordingDate: 1501711289
description: "Description\nWe will review tutorial examples of using CNTK's python interface for image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.\n\nAbstract\nTopics to be covered include ...\n\n-Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) installation\n-What is \"machine learning\"? [gradient descent example]\n-What is \"learning representations\"?\n-Why do Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) help?\n-How do we prevent overfitting?\n-CNTK Packages and Modules\n-Deep Learning Examples [including Convolutional Neural Network -(CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) examples]\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
