description: "The JavaScript language is continuously evolving. Developers want to take advantage of new syntax and features right away. Transpilers like Babel have exploded in popularity, because they enable you to use next generation JavaScript without waiting for browser support.\n\nIn this talk, Jem Young (@jemyoung) and Jacques Favreau (@betaorbust) help you weigh the pros and cons of using new JavaScript features and transpilers by sharing their experiences and findings. Learn about Netflixâ€™s approach to browser support and our experiments to deliver non-transpiled ES2015 code to modern browsers."
