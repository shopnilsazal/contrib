description: "Have you ever cared for the security of the place where you usually live? Have you ever felt that you live in a city that is not taking care of the secure implementations of new technologies and therefore potentially threatening citizens’ life?\n\nThe aim of this panel discussion is to share thoughts, problems and solutions regarding the communication between users, hackers, vendors and governments or administrative offices. This comes along with the discussion of technical challenges and the sharing of a research roadmap from SSC people who will speak about their real world experience and challenges. This will also give everyone the opportunity to join the conversation and express their opinions about what is wrong and what should be done for the future Smart City. You’ll be also able to raise questions and concerns.\n\nWe’ve assembled a panel of experts from all over the world (US, South America, Europe, GCC and Asia) to cover different implementation and point of view in the development of Smart City solutions.\n\n=== \n\nMark Curphey Founder/CEO, SourceClear\n\n--- \n\nCesar Cerrudo is Chief Technology Officer for IOActive Labs\n\n---\n\nEddie Schwartz Executive Vice President - Cyber Services, DarkMatter LLC \n\n--- \n\nMatteo Beccaro Co-Founder/CTO, Opposing Force s.r.l."
