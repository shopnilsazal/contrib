description: "Johnny Long, Google Hacking for Penetration Testers\n\nGoogle Hacking returns for more guaranteed fun this year at Defcon 13! If you haven't caught one of Johnny's Google talks, you definitely should. Come and witness all the new and amazing things that can be done with Google. All new for Defcon 13, Johnny reveals basic and advanced search techniques, basic and advanced hacking techniques, multi-engine attack query morphing, and zero-packet target foot printing and recon techniques. Check out Google's search-blocking tactics (and see them bypassed), and learn all about using Google to locate targets Google doesn't even know about! But wait, there's more! Act now and Johnny will throw in the all new \"Google Hacking Victim Showcase, 2005\" loaded with tons of screenshots (and supporting queries) of some of the most unfortunate victims of this fun, addictive and deadly form of Internet nastiness. Think you're too uber to be caught in a Google talk? Fine. Prove your badness. Win the respect of the audience by crushing the live Google Hacking contest! Submit your unique winning query by the end of the talk to win free books from Syngress Publishing and other cool gear! Or don't. Just listen to your friends rave about it. Whatever.\n\nJohnny Long is a \"clean-living\" family guy who just so happens to like hacking stuff. Over the past two years, Johnny's most visible focus has been on this Google hacking \"thing\" which has served as yet another diversion to a serious (and bill-paying) job as a professional hacker and security researcher for Computer Sciences Corporation. In his spare time, Johnny enjoys making random pirate noises (\"Yarrrrr!\"), spending time with his wife and kids, convincing others that acting like a kid is part of his job as a parent, feigning artistic ability with programs like Bryce and Photoshop, pushing all the pretty shiny buttons on them new-fangled Mac computers, and making much-too-serious security types either look at him funny or start laughing uncontrollably. Johnny has written or contributed to several books, including \"Google Hacking for Penetration Testers\" from Syngress Publishing, which has secured rave reviews and has lots of pictures."
