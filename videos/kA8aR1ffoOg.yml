description: "Data Corruption: Stop the Evil Tribbles by Betsy Haibel\n\nEver had a production bug that you fixed by changing production data? Ever felt like a bad developer for it? Don't. Bad data has countless causes: Weird user input. Race conditions under load. Heck, even changing business needs. We can't fully prevent data corruption, so what matters is how we recover. In this talk, you'll learn how to prevent and fix bad data at every level of your system. You'll learn UX techniques for incremental, mistake-reducing input. You'll learn how to future-proof validations. And you'll learn auditing techniques to catch bad data -- before your users do."
