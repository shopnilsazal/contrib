description: "Sarah Bird - Getting started with Bokeh / Let's build an interactive data visualization for the web..in Python!\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nSlides: [birdsarah.github.io/europython-2015-bokeh][1]\n\nAs a web developer, I find myself being asked to make increasing\nnumbers of data visualizations, interactive infographics, and more.\nd3.js is great, as are many other javascript toolkits that are out\nthere. But if I can write more Python and less JavaScript... well,\nthat makes me happy!\n\nBokeh is a new Python library for interactive visualization. Its\norigins are in the data science community, but it has a lot to offer\nweb developers. In this mini-tutorial, I'll run through how to build a\ndata visualization in Bokeh and how to hook it into your web\napplication. This will be a real-world example, that was previously\nbuilt in d3.js.\n\nAlong the way, I'll provide tips and tricks that I've discovered in my\nexperience including how Bokeh works wonderfully with the iPython\nnotebook which I use to prototype my visualizations, and many data\nscience people use as their native way to explore data.\n\nFor those of you who already know a little Bokeh, I'll be covering the\nnew \"actions framework\" that lets you write JS callbacks in your\npython code so you can do lots of interactions all on the client side.\n\n[1]: http://birdsarah.github.io/europython-2015-bokeh/"
