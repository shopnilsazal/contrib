Every friend or page liked on Facebook, each connection in LinkedIn or Twitter account followed is a new relationship not only between two people, but also between their data. In Brazil only, we have 160 millions Facebook users. How can we represent and manipulate all these relationships? Graph Databases are storage systems that use graph structure (nodes and edges) to represent and store data in a semantic way.\n\nThis talk will begin approaching the challenge in representing relationships in Relational Databases and introducing a more friendly solution using graph. The definition of Graph Database, its pros and cons and some available tools (Neo4J, OrientDB and TitanDB) will be shown during the presentation, as well as how these tools can be integrated with Python.\n\nOutline:\n\n\nRelationships\n\nRelationships in Relational Databases\nGraph Definition\nGraph approach to represent relationships\n\nGraph Databases\n\nDefinition\nAdvantages\n\nNeo4J\n\nUsage Examples\nIntegration with Python\n\nComparison between Graph Databases\nComparison between Neo4J and Relational Database\nApplications\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
