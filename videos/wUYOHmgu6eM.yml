description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\nFriday, September 19 â€¢ 2:00pm - 2:45pm\n\nFrom the Ground Up\n \nThis project started by a challenge given to me at Appsec EU conference in Hamburg as I said that it should be possible to do dynamic source-sink analysis in basic Java applications. My challengers then told me: \"Prove it\". It took a while, but fairly soon I had a simple setup in which I demonstrated simple Log manipulation on the commandline and that it was detectable. This project is the continuation of that proof and is aimed at developers to help them detect security vulnerabilities using live source-sink analysis. It is dependent on the code coverage and not aimed to be used in a production environment.\n\nSpeaker\n\nSteven van der Baan\nSecurity Consultant, 7Safe\nSteven van der Baan is a Principle Consultant at 7Safe, an information security organisation based in Melbourn, UK.
