title: '#HITB2018AMS CommSec D2 - Automatic Generation of ROP Chains -   Ricardo. J. Rodríguez & Daniel Uroz'
recordingDate: 1524386346
description: "Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) attacks allow to hijack the control-flow execution of a vulnerable process using instructions already present in its memory map. Thus, the attacker concatenates sequences of instructions (named ROP gadgets) redirecting the control-flow execution to perform whatever computation he/she wants. Those instruction sequences, when executed, perform a well-defined operation, such as a XOR or an addition between two registers.\n\nA Turing machine is an abstract concept to define a theoretical model able to solve any computational problem using a set of minimal operations. A system is said to be Turing-complete whether simulates a Turing machine, that is, if it is able to perform the same set of minimal operations. In particular, these operations are: to load a constant, to move values, to load and to store a value from/to memory, and to perform arithmetic and logic operations.\n\nIn this talk, we introduce a tool named EasyROP, which seeks the gadgets in a given binary file that are semantically equivalent to each of those operations. Hence, EasyROP helps to automate the development of ROP attacks. We analyzed the main dynamic-link libraries of most flavours of Windows OS, in 32 and 64-bit modes, to study the feasibility of an attack on these systems. We found that shell32.dll is the best candidate in 32-bit systems. In the case of 64-bit systems, none DLL allows to build a Turing machine. We also show the applicability with a real case study, building a ROP chain for CVE-2010-3333 to defeat a Windows 7 OS with DEP enabled.\n\n=== \n\nRicardo J. Rodríguez received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from the University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain, in 2010 and 2013, respectively. His Ph.D. dissertation was focused on performance analysis and resource optimization in critical systems, with special interest in Petri net modelling techniques. He is currently an Assistant Professor at Centro Universitario de la Defensa, General Military Academy, Zaragoza, Spain. His research interests include performance and dependability analysis, program binary analysis, and contactless cards security. He has participated as speaker (and trainer) in several security conferences, such as NoConName, Hack.LU, RootedCON, Hack in Paris, MalCON, or Hack in the Box Amsterdam, among others.\n\n--- \n\nDaniel Uroz received the BSc. on Computer Engineering at University of Zaragoza. He is interested on analysis and detection of new cyber threats. Currently, he is working as junior malware analyst in a security vendor."
