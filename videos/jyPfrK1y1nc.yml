description: "RailsConf 2017: Teaching RSpec to Play nice with Rails by Sam Phippen\n\nRSpec gives you many ways to test your Rails app. Controller, view, model, and so on. Often, it's not clear which to use. In this talk, you'll get some practical advice to improve your testing by understanding how RSpec integrates with Rails. To do this we'll look through some real world RSpec bugs, and with each one, clarify our understanding of the boundaries between RSpec and Rails.\n\nIf you're looking to level up your testing, understand RSpec's internals a little better, or improve your Rails knowledge, this talk will have something for you. Some knowledge of RSpec's test types will be assumed."
