title: 'AppSec EU 2017 Long Term Study On SSL TLS Certificates by Enrico Branca'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495760057
description: "The amount of encrypted communication is constantly increasing but nobody can really say if the encrypted data is secure or not. Every time data has to be encrypted, an encryption key has to be created and used to secure the channel, but no information is available regarding the security or the quality of the key itself.\n\nWe conducted a long term study (48 months) to analyze and test a large number of cryptographic keys, collected from open and public sources and across a variety of protocols. Each key has been subjected to a battery of tests to identify possible issues and generate security related metrics.\n\nIn this presentation we will review how cryptographic keys have been collected and tested, how the tests led to the identification of a large numbers of vulnerable and insecure keys, and which kind of issues are affecting the industry the most.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
