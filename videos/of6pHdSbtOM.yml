title: 'An End-to-End Machine Learning Ecosystem in a Quarter by Chris Hausler'
recordingDate: 1438658611
description: "Building a machine learning model is hard. Building and serving individual machine learning models for thousands of customers every single day is harder. Model training time must be kept to a minimum, memory constraints are exacerbated and the love and insight that one would usually apply to refining a single model must be automated and scaled. At Zendesk we successfully use pandas, scikit-learn, flask and hadoop to run a machine learning ecosystem that builds, tunes and serves account specific models via an API for many of our customers. This talk is about what we learnt building it and how Python's data stack let us get it to production really really fast.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nJuly 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
