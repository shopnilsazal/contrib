description: "PyData London 2016\n\nI was given this title by the Executive Director of NumFOCUS as punishment for being late in putting together a proposal.

I'll probably show off some nifty (C)Python hacks, like adding AST-literals or resurrecting the print statement or implementing lambda-fusion."
