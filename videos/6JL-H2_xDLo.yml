description: "PyData SV 2014 \nIPython is an exciting, fast-moving project, which just had a major release. IPython 2.0 introduces lots of cool new features for exploratory computing, such as interactive widgets, a new, more customizable, modal user interface, notebook security, and directory navigation. With 2.0 released, we are already hard at work on our next major milestones, including updates to better integrate languages other than Python, a multi-user notebook server, static widget export, and more. I will demonstrate some of the new features, discuss future plans, and examine some of our experiences managing a popular open source project with a small team of funded developers."
