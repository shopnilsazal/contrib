description: "By Oliver Laslett & Andraz Hribernik\n\nFilmed at PyData London 2017\n\nDescription\nWith this one weird trick you can build a text processing pipeline!\n\nWe've all fallen for clickbait articles online. They pollute our news feeds and make it harder to filter out valuable information. In this workshop we'll stream news articles in real-time and detect clickbait using simple machine learning techniques. You won't believe what happened next...\n\nAbstract\nBy the end of the workshop you'll have your very own python app for streaming real-time news and detecting click bait. In the workshop we'll cover: - Streaming data from a REST API - Preprocessing textual data - Training a simple machine learning classifier for clickbait - Putting everything together in a scikit-learn pipeline - Analysing our results (which news source is the most clickbaity?)\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
