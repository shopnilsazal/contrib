title: 'Martin Goodson: NLP on a billion documents: Scalable machine learning with Spark'
recordingDate: 1444123689
description: "Apache Spark is becoming the new lingua franca for distributed computing. In this talk I'll show how many machine learning tasks can be scaled up almost trivially using Spark. For instance, we'll see how a semi-supervised NLP algorithm can be trained on a billion training examples using a Spark cluster.\n\nFull details â€”\_http://london.pydata.org/schedule/presentation/36/"
