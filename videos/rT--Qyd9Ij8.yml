description: "PyData London 2018\n\nTelcos have vast amounts of data about user behaviour, but it is often extremely highly dimensional and sparsely populated, making it hard to learn from using conventional ML techniques. By compressing this data into a smaller space, we can build simple downstream models that leverage subtle features in the data - like predicting gender or churn - without handcrafted features.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
