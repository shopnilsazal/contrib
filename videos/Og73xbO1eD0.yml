description: "Birds travel thousands of miles each year to migrate, flying for hours on very little food and rest. By comparison, migrating databases seems like a paltry feat. Birdwave is a way to visualize the amazing phenomenon of bird migration. Using ClojureScript and Om allowed the app to be written in a declarative, concise manner, taking full advantage of JavaScript interoperability, as well as Clojureâ€™s awesome built-in features such as persistent data structures and the async module. Also, prepare to be dazzled by the data-viz powerhouse that is d3. No birds were harmed in the creation of Birdwave. Or this talk.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HdCx/"
