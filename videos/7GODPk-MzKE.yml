description: "A talk was cancelled and Priest takes to the stage to do an impromtu \"Spot the Fed\". \n\nWhat is Spot the Fed you ask? Well it's a game we've played at DEF CON forever now...Here's a description from Priest: \n\n\"Like a paranoid version of pin the tail on the donkey, the favorite sport at this gathering of computer hackers and phone phreaks seems to be hunting down real and imagined telephone security and Federal and local law enforcement authorities who the attendees are certain are tracking their every move... Of course, they may be right.\" - John Markhoff, NYT\n\nBasically the contest goes like this: If you see some shady MIB (Men in Black) earphone penny loafer sunglass wearing Clint Eastwood to live and die in LA type lurking about, point him out. Just get my attention and claim out loud you think you have spotted a fed. The people around at the time will then (I bet) start to discuss the possibility of whether or not a real fed has been spotted. Once enough people have decided that a fed has been spotted, and the Identified Fed (I.F.) has had a say, and informal vote takes place, and if enough people think it's a true fed, or fed wanna-be, or other nefarious style character, you win a \"I spotted the fed!\" shirt, and the I.F. gets an \"I am the fed!\" shirt.\n\nNOTE TO THE FEDS: This is all in good fun, and if you survive unmolested and undetected, but would still secretly like an \"I am the fed!\" shirt to wear around the office or when booting in doors, please contact me when no one is looking and I will take your order(s). Just think of all the looks of awe you'll generate at work wearing this shirt while you file away all the paperwork you'll have to produce over this convention. I won't turn in any feds who contact me, they have to be spotted by others."
