description: 'Social engineering tests are typically performed in a point-in-time fashion, targeting specific people at particular points in their day or their workflow. Additionally, our industry has invested considerable research in improving the way we prepare for and execute these types of attacks. From the perspective of managing security for a company, knowing that people will make mistakes only goes so far from a utility and risk management perspective. This talk will explore a new way to extract value from social engineering tests and the subsequent analysis of the results, digging into the underlying themes, roles, and discretionary conditions that enable social engineering in the first place.'
