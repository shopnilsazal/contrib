description: "SECURITY STARTS WITH YOU: SOCIAL ENGINEERING\n\nVirus? There’s an app for that. Malware? There’s an app for that. Social engineering? It’s a little more complicated. \n\nAimed at average users who could be targeted by such an attack, I will look at the tools of social engineering, how to avoid them & why companies fail to prep employees for attacks.\n\nTIBERIUS HEFFLIN\n\nTibbs recently graduated from the University of West of Scotland with a degree in computer security. She has relocated to Portland, OR, where she evangelizes for privacy and security while doing security assurance work for Portland General Electric. \n\nShe is passionate about encouraging small children to take the plunge into STEM and about laughing at cats on the internet."
