description: "This workshop is designed for programmers of any skill level who want to learn functional programming. PureScript is ideal for learning functional programming, because the language has simple, clean semantics, and runs on any platform because it compiles to ubiquitous Javascript. In this workshop, you'll learn what it means to think functionally and write functional code as you explore the core concepts in PureScript. By the end, you'll have written your first functional program (a simple game!) and be able to call yourself a rookie functional programmer.... or else the instructor promises to buy you a coffee!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Hbtd/"
