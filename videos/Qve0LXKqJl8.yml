description: "By, Lauren Voswinkel\nYou've learned about Service Oriented Architecture. You want to use it. You know the benefits to testing speeds, to team velocity, and page load (why do in sequence what can be done in parallel?). \nProblem is, you're tearing your hair out trying to figure out how to actually pull those services out of your monorail. \nThis talk isn't about the overview. This isn't about the metrics to determine what should be pulled out into a service. \nThis talk isn't even about optimizing the service you pull out. This talk is a step-by-step approach about how to successfully pull that service, embedded in your app, out so it can be the best little service it can be, and you can get back to that velocity that your managers keep saying \"we used to be able to do\".\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGYV/"
