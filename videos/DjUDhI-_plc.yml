This year we're inviting you to \"Meet the Feds and Ex-Feds\" to answer your questions. The objective is to get you the answers to your questions without getting a public official fired! Our goal, probably not yours! Come ask your question and compare the answers you get.\n\nEach of the agency reps and ex-agency rep will make an opening statement regarding their agencies role, and then open it up to the audience for questions.\n\nWith representatives from Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3), FBI, IRS, NCIS, NASA, DHS USCERT, DoJ, NSA , National White Collar Crime Center (NWC3), NSA, US Postal IG, Office of the Secretary of Defense, National Defense University and other fine Federal agencies, you will have an abundance of opportunities to attempt to humiliate, harass, threaten, or even bring them to tears. Go ahead hack away and take your best shot. Remember, what is said on this panel in Vegas, stays on this panel in Vegas..\n\nFor years Defcon participants have played \"Spot the Fed.\" For the 4th year, the feds will play \"Spot the Lamer\". Come out and nominate a Lamer and watch the feds burn' em.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
