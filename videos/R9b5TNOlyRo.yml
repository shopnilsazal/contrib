description: "Preserving Digital Art and Games for 100 Years! By Wilkie \n\nDigital art, both non-interactive and interactive, has been an important part of the digital age. Video games are the most obvious example: interactive real-time art and narrative. There is much more! The demoscene, for instance, is a culture of digital art where people create real-time computer-generated art as close to the metal of the machine as possible. It is sad to see these incredible pieces lost to time.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss a tool called OCCAM that can intelligently determine how to build a virtual machine to run any digital object. We will preserve and run old art and old DOS games within a web browser using tools including, but not limited to, virtual machines and Docker. We will hopefully learn to appreciate art that is old but new to us!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/KYiF/"
