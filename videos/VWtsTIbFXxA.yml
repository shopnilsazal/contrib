I'll describe my original intentions, symptoms, how I eventually discovered the mistake, and possibly even a solution. The topics include mistakes in A/B testing, Kaggle competitions, data collection, and other fields. I'll also introduce some interesting statistical and machine learning counterexamples: examples where our original intuition fails, and solutions to these examples.\n\nSlides available here: http://www.slideshare.net/PyData/mistakes-ive-made-cam-davidsonpilon"
