description: "Rachel Bunder\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/154/view_talk\nPython is an easy language to learn. Many Python programmers just picked it up thinking “It can’t be too different from X, just with indents!”. By learning a language this way you don’t discover the features unique to that language. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll take a tour of Python features that are easily missed. This includes list comprehension,  generator functions and the PEP documents. Where appropriate time comparisons between different methods will be given."
