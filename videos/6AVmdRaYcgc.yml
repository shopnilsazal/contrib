description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nOla Bini - Language Geek\n\nABSTRACT\nWhole genome sequencing is finally starting to become practical. But with this deluge of data, many challenges remain to use this technology in clinical settings. A small team of developers have spent a year working on an approach to better cancer treatments using state of the art technology such as Clojure, Neo4j and domain specific languages. This presentation introduces the problem, talks about the solution we ended up with, the technology and the teams non-traditional approach to process.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
