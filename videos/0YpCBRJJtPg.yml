recordingDate: 1451501541
description: 'If you have heard nothing else about Erlang, you have probably heard something about OTP and people chanting “Processes are not threads. Processes are really cheap. Ohmmmm.” In this workshop you will get a overview of Erlang syntax, OTP process management, and how cheap Erlang processes really are when you implement a Markov Chain generator where each state and its possible transitions are represented by their own process.'
