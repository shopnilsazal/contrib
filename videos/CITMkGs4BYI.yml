description: "There are tonnes of little- or virtually unknown libraries in Ruby's stdlib, and they found their way there for a reason. Much like revisiting Enumerable's method list times and again makes you a better Ruby programmer, so does looking into its standard library -- not only because there are things you didn't know existed, but also because the way the're implemented is often quite enlightening.\n\nThis talk shows some of the useful, clever and tricky uses of Ruby's standard library -- like GServer, DRb/Rinda, PStore, Ripper and SecureRandom -- that do not require the installation of any gems and can be used in any environment hosting a Ruby implementation. Did you ever want to write your own server, do some distributed computing, don't worry about persistence? It's all there; come and see for yourself!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4K/"
