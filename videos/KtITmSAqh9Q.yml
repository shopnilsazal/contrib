description: 'Machine learning is sneaking into everything, even into functional programming languages! Probabilistic programming integrates standard programming with probabilistic machine learning - and allows people to write probabilistic models without having to care about how they are evaluated and all the mathematical details underneath. In the talk, I''ll show you what is probabilistic programming about, how it works and how you might include probability distributions into F# - and mainly why you don''t need a PhD in statistics to write a Bayesian machine learning model.'
