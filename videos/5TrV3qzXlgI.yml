title: 'Squash: A Debugger for Kubernetes Apps - Idit Levine, solo.io'

description: "Squash: A Debugger for Kubernetes Apps - Idit Levine, solo.io\n\nSquash is a tool for debugging distributed applications.\n\nMost cloud native applications written today follow the microservice architecture. These applications are distributed by nature, and therefore hard to debug.\n\nMicroservice engineers debug their applications by printing values of select variables into log files. This leaves them with the daunting task of sorting through reams of log data, which at best provide a partial view of the state of application. This approach is cumbersome, time consuming and works better with \"easy\" bugs.\n\nMany advanced tools to debug monolitic applications exist in the market, and provide users with powerful ways to dissect their programs and to interact with them on the fly. However, these tools cannot be used directly for debugging applications that follow the microservice architecture pattern.\n\nSquash is designed to bring the strength of modern debuggers and the convenience of their IDEs to microservices developers. Squash uses popular, powerful and mature debuggers (gdb, dlv, java debugging) and integrates them seamlessly with Kubernetes. This allows devs to use the debugger of their choice, and the IDEs that support it, to develop microservices on any platform.\n\nAbout Idit Levine\nFounder, solo.io\nIdit Levine is a leader and innovator in the Cloud open source community, and the founder of solo.io. Until recently, Idit was CTO for cloud management division at EMC and a member of its global CTO office, where she had focused on Management and Orchestration (M&O) over the entire stack and on microservices, cloud native apps, cluster management and Platform as a Service. \n\nIditâ€™s fascination with the cloud sprouted when she joined DynamicOps (vRealize, now part of VMware) as one of its first employees. She subsequently took part in developing the new-generation public cloud of Verizon Terremark, and served as an acting CTO at Intigua, a startup company that focuses on container and management technology."
