description: "by Nico Rikken\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThis lightning talk will provide you with the necessary context and links tostart working with energy data in your own projects.\n\nThe Smart Grid is coming, at webscale, enabled by Internet of Things,resulting in Big Data. A clear statement, right? Not at all! Let me show youwhat is going on behind these buzzwords:\n\n  1. First I'll take you briefly through the analog origins of utility energy data to help you understand why this seems counter-intuitive by modern standards.  2. Second I'll go over the driving force for opening up the energy data: why sustainable energy demands it, and how businesses and consumers can benefit.  3. Then having created a common understanding of the word of energy data, I'll go over developments in mainly the field of Internet of Things to highlight the potential, but also where it fall short to support renewable energy. I will specifically address practical technologies and frameworks, and some examples of energy data usage.\n\nThis lightning talk will provide you with the necessary context and links tostart working with energy data in your own projects. As a bonus it will alsomake you aware of differences inside Europe, as this might be a hindrance inyour project.\n\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:20:00"
