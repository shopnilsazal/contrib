description: "Jake Pittis, Shopify\n \nFibers get cut, databases crash, and you’ve adopted Chaos Engineering to challenge your production environment as much as possible. But what are you doing to craft the resiliency test suites that minimizes the impact of your application as much as possible? How do you debug resiliency problems locally, and make sure to architect for robustness as development-time? Toxiproxy is an open-source tool we’ve used for the past 2 years to emulate timeouts, latency and outages and one we believe could benefit nearly every company faced with these issues. In this talk, we’ll dive into practical tips, lessons learned, and best practices so you can use Toxiproxy to write resilient test suites.\n\nView the full LISA17 program: https://www.usenix.org/lisa17/program"
