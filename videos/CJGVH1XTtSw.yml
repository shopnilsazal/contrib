recordingDate: 1419007761
description: "JRuby 9000 is the largest update to the JRuby platform during its lifetime. We will support Ruby 2.1 (or perhaps 2.2) features, replace our execution pipeline with a new optimizing compiler, support true native IO and Process logic, and finally bring character transcoding in line with MRI. At the same time, people are building more and more amazing things with JRuby. In this talk, we'll unveil JRuby 9000 and talk about the future of JRuby and Ruby.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FqJc/"
