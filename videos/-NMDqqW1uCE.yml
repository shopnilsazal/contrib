description: "RailsConf 2017: Processing Streaming Data at a Large Scale with Kafka by Thijs Cadier\n\nUsing a standard Rails stack is great, but when you want to process streams of data at a large scale you'll hit the stack's limitations. What if you want to build an analytics system on a global scale and want to stay within the Ruby world you know and love?\n\nIn this talk we'll see how we can leverage Kafka to build and painlessly scale an analytics pipeline. We'll talk about Kafka's unique properties that make this possible, and we'll go through a full demo application step by step. At the end of the talk you'll have a good idea of when and how to get started with Kafka yourself."
