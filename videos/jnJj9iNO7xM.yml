description: "Monster Hunter is a smash hit in Japan, but the series hadn't garnered the same popularity overseas. This GDC 2016 session from Capcom's Andrew Alfonso talks about how Capcom's localization directors tackle new challenges to deliver high quality titles for North America and Europe, using the localization of Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate as an example.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
