Adobe LSOs are similar to HTTP cookies, but not as easily controlled or configured using a standard web browser. Potential problems with Flash LSOs will be presented, as well as suggestions for increasing privacy while using Adobe LSOs.\n\nClinton Wong published HTTP Pocket Reference and Web Client Programming with Perl. He works in Silicon Valley.\n\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
