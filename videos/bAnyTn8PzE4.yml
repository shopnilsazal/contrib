The presentation uses statistics and facts to map out where the industry currently is and details the problems with the current model. After the problems with the current model are shown then the groundwork for the future of the music business is laid out showing how the recording industry is no longer needed. Included in the presentation is information on how artists can produce their own music cutting out the recording business.\n\nThe recent increase in quality and decrease in price of recording equipment has made it very feasible for artists to make very high quality recordings on their own. This is the way of the future, and the processes are detailed by an independent music producer with experience in the field. Most people do not know it is possible to make quality recordings that rival commercial ones from your apartment, without even disturbing your neighbors. People are screaming for a change in the music industry. With all of the problems that the RIAA is creating for the music consumer, consumers will begin to be open to a new model where the hassles of the RIAA will no longer be an issue. The future of the music business will also afford more opportunity to artists leveling the playing field and decreasing competition between artists.\n\nNathan Hamiel (Ichabod Ver7) is an independent artist and producer living in Jacksonville, FL.
