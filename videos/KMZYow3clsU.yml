description: "Devops is a buzzword, but in reduction it means putting the people who are responsible for new features in charge of getting them out there. At Pivotal Labs we work with 30 startups at a time, and have seen what works well and what makes developers cringe and slows down progress. I'd like to convince every developer to start running the sites they work on, embrace change throughout their infrastructure, and give some tips for how to do it along the way.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGg1/"
