title: 'loneStarRuby Conf 2013 - Fluent Refactoring by Sam Livingston-Gray'
recordingDate: 1376955961
description: "Fluency is \"what you can say without having to think about how to say it.\" \"Refactoring\" is a language that describes ways to make your code better. I want to inspire you to learn more of that language, so you can make your code better without having to think about it.\n\nI'll walk you through the process of reworking a 50-line controller action that's hard to comprehend, let alone refactor. We'll tease apart fiendishly intertwined structures, embrace duplication, use dirty tricks to our advantage, and uncover responsibilities—and bugs!—that weren't obvious at first glance.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8j/"
