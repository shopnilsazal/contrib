description: "Global Honeypot Trends\nElliot Brink\n\nMany of my computer systems are constantly compromised, attacked, hacked, 24/7. How do I know this? I've been allowing it. This presentation will cover over one year of research running several vulnerable systems (or honeypots) in multiple countries including the USA, mainland China, Russia and others. We'll be taking a look at: a brief introduction to honeypots, common attacker trends (both sophisticated and script kiddie), brief malware analysis and the statistical analysis of attackers based on GeoIP. Are there differences in attacks based on where a computer system is located? Let's investigate this together! Beginners to the topic of honeypots fear not, the basics will be covered.\n\nBIO: Elliott Brink (Twitter: @ebrinkster) Elliott is an Information Security Consultant based out of Chicago, IL. He specializes in internal/external pentesting, security architecture, and social engineering engagements. He loves computer history, tracking bad guys, honeypots, an expertly crafted bloody mary and traveling the globe."
