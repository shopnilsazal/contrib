description: "Paul Roberts, Aaron Barr, Joshua Corman and Jericho - \"Whoever Fights Monsters...\" Aaron Barr, Anonymous, and Ourselves\n\n\"Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster.\" - Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nAaron Barr returns for the first time in what's sure to be a gritty and frank (and heated) panel. How can we conduct ourselves without losing ourselves? How far is too far - or not far enough? IT security has finally gotten the attention of the mainstream media, Pentagon generals and public policy authors in the Beltway, and is now in mortal danger of losing (the rest of) its soul. We've convinced the world that the threat is real - omnipresent and omnipotent. But recent events suggest that in their efforts to combat a faceless enemy, IT security firms and their employees risk becoming indistinguishable from the folks with the Black Hats. The Anonymous attacks and data spilled from both private- and public sector firms raise important questions that this panel will try to answer. among them: how to respond to chaotic actors like Anonymous and LulzSec, what the U.S. gains (and loses) by making \"APTs\" the new \"Commies\" and cyber the forefront of the next Cold War and APTs the new commies. Aaron, Josh and Jericho will debate whether we in the security community can fight our \"monsters\" without sacrificing the civil liberties and the freedoms we enjoy here at home.\n\nFull bios and descriptions available here: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-19/dc-19-speakers.html#Roberts"
