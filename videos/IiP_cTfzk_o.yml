title: 'ElixirConf 2015 - Gettext for Elixir - getting serious at compile time by Andrea Leopardi'
recordingDate: 1444935902
description: 'One of Elixir''s greatest strength are macros, and everybody knows that. However, macros are just one way to access a powerful and magical land: the compile time™. In the last few months, I''ve been working on a gettext implementation for Elixir (under the direction of José). This library does most of its work at compile time. In this talk, we''ll have a look at what crazy things you can do at compile time as well as some examples of taking advantage of compile time in the wild (and in Elixir itself). We''ll see how moving things from the runtime to the compile time has huge benefits in terms of performance, without sacrificing clarity and expressiveness. We''ll dive into Gettext''s source code as the main example of this.'
