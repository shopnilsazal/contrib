description: 'Beyond the Classifier, Inspiration from Engineering Algorithms: Many data scientists work within the realm of Machine Learning and their problems are often addressable with techniques such as classifiers and recommendation engines. At Tapad, we have often had to look outside that standard toolkit to find inspiration from more traditional engineering algorithms. This has included solving our Device Graph’s connected component problem at scale as well as maintaining our Device Graph’s time-consistency in our cluster identification week over week.'
