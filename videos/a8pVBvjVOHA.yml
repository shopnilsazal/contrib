description: "Abstract :\nThis talk begins by exploring the answer to the question, why does DevOps matter? Business do what they need to do to survive and succeed. If their customers need agility, then they will evolve to accommodate that.\n\nNext, key differences between the pre-DevOps world and the post-DevOps world are discussed. Before, it was about on-premise, protecting the perimeter, and enforcing gates in the SDLC. Now, supply chain is king. Applications and APIs matter more and more. And everything is mobile.\n\nA detailed look at 10 companies \"killing it at DevOps\" reveals that for agile companies, security is a strategic business driver. It prevents unplanned work and re-work, and security requirements are explicitly specified during the sales process as part of vendor security assessments.\n\nAdditional drivers also include avoiding bad press and compliance reasons - both of which, if you look under the covers, are ultimately about getting more sales. This presentation analyzes the actual language in Bill Gates' Trustworthy Computing memo to see that in fact even Microsoft's \"noble\" initiative was \"all about the money.\"\n\nThat being said, what's a security professional to do? BSIMM has 113 controls, ISO27017 has 121, and CCM has 133. It's enough to make a person's brain explode.\n\nThis session concludes with expert recommendations on how to think about security for DevOps in a way that aligns with a modified version of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The 5 points (Identify, Prevent, Detect, Respond, and Recover) are simplified down to just 3 (Identify, Prevent, and React) and the end of the session covers detailed recommendations on how to incorporate practical security concepts into a DevOps environment using this uncomplicated framework.\n\nby Caroline Wong, Vice President of Security Strategy at Cobalt\n\nWebsite: cobalt.io\n\nAbout Caroline Wong\nCaroline’s close and practical information security knowledge stems from broad experience as a Cigital consultant, a Symantec product manager, and day-to-day leadership roles at eBay and Zynga.
