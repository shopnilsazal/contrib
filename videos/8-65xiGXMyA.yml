description: "by Tristan Gingold\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe Raspberry PI 3 board is very popular, but mainly known as a Linuxplatform. But it could also be used to do bare metal development: writing low-level code without any OS. There are almost no tutorials on the internetaddressing the main new feature of the RPI-3 board: 4x 64 bit cores (previousgenerations were 32 bit). Let's fill the gap by this lightening talk: a veryshort presentation of the board, how to write and build a first example and ademo of a more advanced multi-core application.\n\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 14:40:00"
