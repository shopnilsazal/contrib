description: "Maria Naggaga\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/dotnetfringe/sdkxmf/\nWhen students s think about .Net they think: legacy , enterprise , retired,  and what is that.\nStudents  are at the  center of the open source community  where contributing to a project and being part of  community is part of being a developer. The open sourcing of  .Net  brings a new opportunity for the new wave of developers to experience Microsoft . In my talk I  will be going over  how I have  been using Asp.net vNext to engage with the student developer, and how they have responded to it."
