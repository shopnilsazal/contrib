description: "PyData DC 2016\n\nAgent-based modeling is a technique used to explore both complexity and emergence by simulating individual actors and their actions within a system. Think of systems such as the traffic in a city, or like those in financial markets where one actor can have an effect on the decisions of others until the systemâ€™s direction changes its course. In this talk, you will learn about ABMs in Python."
