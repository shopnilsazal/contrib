title: 'GopherCon 2014 The Go Circuit: Towards Elastic Computation with No Failures by Petar Maymounkov'

description: "We discuss the Go Circuit project and set it in the context of an inevitable and oncoming shift in the development and runtime stacks of the Internet age. We argue that the programming language is the right place to abstract access to a hardware clusters as a \"Single-System Image\". On the way, we appeal to the success of Erlang in the Telecom industry and discuss why it has not yet inspired Internet-age counterparts. Somewhat unlike Erlang, where the distributed operating system OTP is below the language, we assert that the distributed OS should be built above and using the language. We conclude with an important high-level observation that single desktop machines are qualitatively identical and only quantitatively different than distributed hardware clusters, in terms of the semantics of their behavior in the presence of failures.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1W/"
