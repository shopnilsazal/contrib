recordingDate: 1458611769
description: "Bitcoin is not only a currency. It's a system, a platform and an invention. Many human activities that previously required centralized institutions or organizations to function as authoritative or trusted points of control can now be decentralized. This has profound implications for security. To take full advantage of this new paradigm, traditional security concepts need to be redefined.\_\n\nThis presentation will review and dissect some of bitcoin’s core components and their security controls. The speaker will analyze and explain the controls and how they could be repurposed in other domains.\n\nCassio Goldschmidt\nCassio Goldschmidt, CBP, is a globally recognized information security leader, known for his contributions toOWASP, SAFECode, CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors, along with contributing to the security education curriculum of numerous universities.
