Provides a high-level overview of the fundamental components that comprise a holistic monitoring system and then drills into real-world examples with tools like ActiveSupport::Notifications, statsd/rack-statsd, and CollectD. Also covers best practices for active alerting on custom monitoring data.\n\nCleaned up audio version is here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0spo9hvDz_4\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGia/"
