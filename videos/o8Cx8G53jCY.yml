description: "InStream: Large Scale Distribution using BitTorrent, Python, Salt, and Kafka\n\nHarsh Sharma, LinkedIn\n\nDeploying application/services to all the servers across every datacenter can be painful for any company with a big infrastructure, including LinkedIn.\n\nOur deployment model had some centralized pieces which became bottlenecks at scale. This talk will describe how we built a service in Python, based on Saltstack and Kafka, which can deploy any service to all servers asynchronously with a P2P distribution model, rate limiting and fast rollbacks.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
