description: "In a presentation from GDC 2013, Riot's Tom Cadwell discusses how single-player design approaches must be modified for multiplayer experiences by including the creation of counterplay (gameplay for the opponents of a player) and teamplay (gameplay for the teammates of a player) - looking at the company's hit League Of Legends as a key example.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
