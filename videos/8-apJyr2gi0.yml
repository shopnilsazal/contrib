description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nInside Kubernetes Resource Management (QoS) – Mechanics and Lessons from the Field - Michael Gasch, VMware (Any Skill Level)\n\nKubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) offers powerful primitives for resource management, that is workload prioritization, fairness and efficiency. But it's also a complex topic to understand and get right in production, e.g. if you are new to this topic or running highly dynamic and distributed systems.  Getting the most value out of a Kubernetes cluster requires utilizing the features provided to categorize and prioritize your workloads. We'll look at how Kubernetes provides this functionality through its QoS implementation. Both, from an end-user's perspective but also digging into the mechanics. The work doesn't stop there though. This talk will also explore techniques on how to tune your application using best practices and lessons learned in the field. Finally, we'll provide community resources and an outlook about taking QoS to the next level in your cluster.\n\nAbout Michael\nMichael Gasch is an Application Platform Architect and member of the CTO Ambassador program at VMware. He supports enterprises with architectural guidance, and works closely with VMware R&D. Right from the beginning of his career, he built and operated very large Linux distributed storage and vSphere virtualization platforms. Lately, in a customer and developer-focused role, he went back to his Linux roots in the field of distributed systems, container orchestration and scheduling. He´s actively tweeting about all things distributed under his Twitter handle @embano1. When time permits, he presents at large industry events (VMworld), but also community events like Kubernetes, AWS and Docker meetups, and vBrownbag Youtube series. You can find his blog, dedicated to deep-dive container internals, here: https://embano1.github.io/"
