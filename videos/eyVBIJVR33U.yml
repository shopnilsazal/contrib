description: "Many machines and devices come equipped with powerful graphical processing units, or GPUs. These units have hundreds of processing cores, and can be exploited to accelerate our applications by offloading applicable code to the GPU instead of the CPU. In this talk we will cover the basic concepts of General Purpose Programming for GPUs, and show how it can be exploited in the functional programming language, Haskell, via the accelerate library.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HcNj/"
