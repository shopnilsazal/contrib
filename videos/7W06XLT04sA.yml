description: "by Philip Homburg\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nI wrote inet (the TCP/IP stack on MINIX) for two reasons: I like to come upwith my own designs for everything and, most of all, I had to impress AndyTanenbaum enough to become a Ph.D. student. Inet had to fit in with MINIX. Inparticular, it had to live with minimal changes to the MINIX code base. At thesame time, there were quite a few areas where I felt sockets and the BSDTCP/IP implementation were wrong.\n\nIn hindsight, there is a lot that I did not know and got wrong. I this talk, Iwill look at how inet follows the structure of MINIX, what works, and whatwent wrong.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 15:25:00"
