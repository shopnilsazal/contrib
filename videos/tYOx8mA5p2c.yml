recordingDate: 1435943748
description: "@rwarbelow\nThe learning curve to becoming a great developer is incredibly steep, especially when starting with no background knowledge. And it's not a smooth ride, either - trying to learn tools, concepts, syntax, and best practices simultaneously will inevitably result in hiccups along the way. As a DevBootcamp alumnus, Rachel knows what it's like to go from zero to developer in a very short time frame and the challenges that journey can present. Now as an instructor at the Turing School of Software and Design, she draws on her years of experience in the classroom to employ strategies that allow her students just the right balance between hand-holding and struggling. In this talk, Rachel will share tips to help people who are just getting started with programming overcome common struggles while also sharing proven teaching techniques that will help more experienced developers become effective mentors.\n\n Talk given at GORUCO 2015: http://goruco.com"
