description: 'Business users love to interact with applications with spreadsheet files as much as the developers hates doing so. There are many ways how to generate Excel files in Java, starting with ''CSV will do'' approach or ''Generate HTML and save it as XLS'', but what your users really is to get rich content full of colours, different borders and fonts, filters and more. Apache POI is powerful library which allows you to create such documents but it is difficult to use. Spreadsheet Builder provides declarative DSL to create Excel files with grace. The DSL for writing spreadsheets is mirrored in query language to read spreadsheets which can be used to import or test generated files more easily. After short introduction, the framework will be presented on Java and Groovy live examples.'
