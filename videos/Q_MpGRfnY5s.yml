Itâ€™s hard to look at the code and know what it does. But Ruby on Rails is more than just code. Written into it are years of research, discussions, and motivations.

Understanding how Rails works will allow you to write better Rails applications and better Ruby code. You will leave with many resources and tips on perusing Rails."
