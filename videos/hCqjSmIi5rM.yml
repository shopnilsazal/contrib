description: "In this GDC 2014 session, game industry-veteran and leading venture capitalist Mitch Lasky will dig into the pros and cons of the competing next-generation publishing models: the super-developers, the ad networks, the platform players, the social/chat networks and others. Lasky's thesis is that industry changes have not eliminated the profound economic benefit of scale, and that scale is the key to value creation.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
