description: "PyData Hamburg Meetup - July 12th, 2017\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Hamburg/\n\nTilman Lesch \nFeature Engineering - from the lab to the real world of online gambling\n\nAbstract:\nAs an affiliate researcher at the University of British Columbia’s Centre for Gambling Research, I am working on a research project on predicting people’s propensity to develop an online gambling addiction based using their betting behaviour extracted from transaction records on an online gambling site. In my talk, I will first show how theory and laboratory findings associated with behavioural addictions such as loss chasing - the false belief that one can win losses back - , speed of play and specific game features need to be adopted to naturalistic betting records obtained from the online gambling platform. I will then present an example of classifying betting behaviour on different online slots machines and outline the methodological, practical and medical challenges of this approach.\n\nAbout Tilman: \nBefore completing a PhD in Behavioural Neuroscience using reinforcement learning to describe individual differences in decision-making under uncertainty, Tilman completed a Master in Engineering and Economics. He has worked on (big) data projects in academia and industry as data scientist and management consultant. He currently works as researcher and freelance consultant for exploratory data analysis and data strategy.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
