description: "Non-Violent Communication for Fun, Profit, and Self Defense by Isaac Schlueter\n\nManaging open source projects exposes a maintainer to the vagaries of the internet. For all the joy and convenience that a bit of technology may bring to its users, users typically show up when they are in an unhappy place, and the job of the maintainer can quickly become an overwhelming source of stress and burnout.\n\nThis talk will introduce Non-Violent Communication as a toolkit for helping users at their worst, and also prevent the flood of bad vibes from becoming a source of toxicity. By exposing our vulnerability in a direct and honest way, we can turn conversations away from blame and antagonism, towards meaningful connection and opportunities for growth and collaboration. Open source is a social machine, and compassion helps keep the gears from grinding to a halt."
