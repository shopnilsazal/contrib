description: "\"Programming in Scala\", by Martin Odersky et al., is one of the most comprehensive and the de facto reference for Scala. However, the book, originally published in 2008 for Scala 2.7.2, has not been updated since its second edition in 2010, covering up until Scala 2.8.1. In the meantime, Scala has had 3 major releases with numerous fresh and advanced features. While we wait for a third edition of \"Programming in Scala\" to describe all the latest and greatest Scala features introduced in the last 4 years, this talk presents the main features introduced in Scala: 2.9, 2.10, and 2.11, as well as an exciting peek into 2.12 and beyond (What's in Scala's future?).\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HbvU/"
