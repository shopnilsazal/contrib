title: 'DEF CON 15 - David Byrne - Intranet Invasion with Anti DNS Pinning'
recordingDate: 1391558317
description: "Cross Site Scripting has received much attention over the last several years, although some of its more ominous implications have not received much attention. Anti-DNS pinning is a relatively new threat that, while not well understood by most security professionals, is far from theoretical. This presentation will focus on a live demonstration of anti-DNS pinning techniques. A victim web browser will be used to execute arbitrary, interactive HTTP requests to any server, completely bypassing perimeter firewalls.\n\nThis is NOT a Jickto knockoff. Jickto relies on using a proxy or caching site like Google to place both sites in the same domain. This does not allow for full interaction with dynamic pages, or any interaction with internal web sites. This demonstration allows full interaction with arbitrary web servers in the intranet environment. No browser bugs or plug-ins are required to accomplish this, only JavaScript.\n\nThe presenter will demonstrate an automated attack process that provides an HTTP proxy service for the attacker's browser after scanning the internal network for web servers. New requests are retrieved from the attack server by using the width and height of truncated images (only 66 bytes) as a covert channel.*** This bypasses the browser DOM normal behavior of allowing data to be requested only from the server that provided the HTML.\n\nBefore demonstrating the tool, anti-DNS pinning will be explained in a way that anyone familiar with the basics of DNS and HTTP will understand. The presenter will describe the presentation environment and attack components, then walk through the steps in an attack. Once the foundation concepts have been established, the live demonstration will be performed.\n\nTowards the end, the presentation will also briefly cover suggested defenses, including changing pinning behavior in browsers, better intranet security, gateway behavioral scanners, increased granularity for IE security zones, and introduction of security zones into Mozilla and other browsers.\n\nEnhancements to the tool are in-progress to add binary socket capabilities using an untrusted Java Applet. These changes will be complete in time for the presentation. This will allow for full access to any TCP protocol via a web browser supporting JavaScript and a JVM. The attacker would access this via a SOCKS proxy interface. The image dimension-based covert transfer is too slow for many protocols, so a second technique involving Cascading Style Sheets is used.*** The data is smuggled in border values of sequentially named classes. This is clearly a superior method, but there is still benefit from demonstrating the image-based method."
