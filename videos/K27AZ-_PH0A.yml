description: "RailsConf 2018: Continuous Deployments and Data Sovereignty: A Case Study by Mike Calhoun\n\nIn any production rails applicationâ€™s simplest form, there is one version of the app deployed to a single host or cloud provider of your choice, but what if there were laws and regulations in place that required your application to be replicated and maintained within the geographical boundaries of other countries. This is a requirement of countries that have data sovereignty laws and a regular hurdle to overcome when dealing with sensitive data such as protected health information. This talk provides a case study of how we devised an automatic deployment strategy to deploy to multiple countries."
