description: "Timothy Ansell\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/25/view_talk\nPython is generally considered a high level language a long way from hardware, this very fact actually makes it an awesome tool for helping out with the design and creation of hardware!\r\n\r\nThis talk will hopefully cover;\r\n  * Python hardware description languages (HDLs) for creating \"gateware\" for FPGA chips or even real IC design.\r\n  * Python scripting for hardware schematic layout and design rule checking.\r\n  * Python tools for deploying, programming and debugging embedded systems.\r\n  * Some cool projects like the HDMI2USB.tv (open source hardware for video capture) which use many of the above parts.\r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on open source tools."
