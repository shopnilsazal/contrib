description: "Cat Okita - Aura: A Peer To Peer Reputation System\nAura: A Peer To Peer Reputation System\n\nAura is a peer-to-peer reputation system designed to create localized reputation information linked to specific users and/or systems. It can also function as a carrier of information in the form of 'recommendations'. Current research in trust metrics and reputation systems will be briefly covered, and implementation and design challenges will be discussed in greater depth.\n\nCat Okita has a background in sociocultural anthropology, with a focus on online communities, and working for several telco and hosting companies has led to a strong interest in social and technological networks, with a vested interest in establishing trust."
