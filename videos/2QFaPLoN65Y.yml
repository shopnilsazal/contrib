The game is composed of compromised portions of an electric grid, which players can control with the end goal of destroying parts of the electric grid system. It will require cooperation or cunning from players to bring it down. He will explain the details of how the game was created, how realistic the simulations are, and what a well-positioned attacker could hope to achieve. Additionally, Kenneth will discuss IOActive’s research in the area and demonstrate required compromised nodes for system failure, resonances, and more"
