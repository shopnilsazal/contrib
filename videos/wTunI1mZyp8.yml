description: "Integrating Infrastructure as Code into a Continuous Delivery Pipeline by Adarsh Shah & Matthew Kuritz\n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) is the approach that takes proven coding techniques used by software systems and extends them to infrastructure. It is one of the key DevOps practices that enables teams to deliver infrastructure rapidly, reliably and at scale, and thereby, also software running on that infrastructure.\n\nThe primary goal of Continuous Delivery (CD) is to ensure that the software can be reliably released at any time and integrating IaC as part of the CD pipeline helps in achieving that goal.\n\nWith over 13 years of engineering and DevOps experience, Adarsh Shah has helped organizations from various domains adopt IaC and CD. In this presentation, he will show how to integrate Infrastructure as Code into a Continuous Delivery pipeline by applying some of the best practices used by software systems, as well as highlighting other aspects to consider.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nBenefits and challenges of integrating IaC to CD pipeline\nBest practices and patterns to use for integrating IaC to CD pipeline\nTopics include:\n\nSource Control - structure and strategies\nTesting for IaC\nSecurity and Compliance\nProvisioning - Patterns for server provisioning\nBuilding and deploying pipelines"
