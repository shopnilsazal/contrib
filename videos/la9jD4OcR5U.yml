title: '#HITB2016AMS CommSec Track D2 - Inspeckage: Android Package Inspector - Antonio Martins'
recordingDate: 1466056473
description: "The process behind analyzing mobile applications, specially Android ones, is still in a maturing stage requiring the penetration tester to run a series of long laborious tasks, especially when you are doing a blackbox test. In the absence of the application’s source code, knowing the nuances of the application’s behavior at runtime is quite costly and requires the knowledge of complex tools such as a debugger (eg. JDB).\n\nInpseckage, an open source tool that aims to help the consultant understand what the application is doing at runtime was developed to help mitigate such difficulties.\n\nWith simplicity in mind, Inspeckage was built with a friendly web interface with an embbeded HTTP server that allows the consultant to interact and observe the application’s behavior. Through hooks, several library calls that could compromise the security of the app, such as cryptography, data storage, network and IPC calls are intercepted, and sensitive information is collected. Such information is then displayed and updated almost in real time on the web interface.\n\nInspeckage also allows the consultant to interact with the app through calls to components (Activities and Providers) even the unexported ones! In the presentation, I will quickly address the concepts and methodologies adopted in a security analysis of Android applications, followed by a demonstration of how useful Inspeckage can be in such analysis and how to use it.\n\n======\n\nAntonio Carlos Martins is a consultant at Tempest Security Intelligence (http://tempest.com.br/en/), leader in the information security scene in Brazil. Antonio has been working at Tempest for over 5 years conducting offensive consulting, ranging from Penetration testing, web and mobile application analysis and fraud prevention. Also participated in some projects of code review, and giving training in secure development.\n\nHe is currently one of the leaders of the mobile cell, which is a part of a multidisciplinary team inside Tempest called Software Security Labs. He is the creator of Inspeckage, an open source tool for dynamic analysis of Android apps.\n\nAntonio graduated in Computer Science and has presented at AlligatorCon (Brazil), BWCON, OWASP Latam Tour and at TTalks SP (Tempest Talks São Paulo) on various topics about web/mobile."
