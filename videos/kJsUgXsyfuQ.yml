description: "\"dRuby came long before Rails. It uses metaprogramming features for distributed programming. Proxy objects \"automagically\" delegate method calls to remote objects. ... dRuby is a good example of a very flexible system implemented by Ruby. In this sense, Rails is a follower.\" - Matz\n\nMasatoshi Seki, the author of ERB and dRuby, and Makoto Inoue, the translator of \"The dRuby book\"ã€€will show how dRuby's metaprogramming magic works, and inspire you to use the full power of ruby.\n\nWe will explain the history and design concepts behind dRuby, before diving into the details of the metaprogramming magic that makes it all work. dRuby will show you a side of Ruby you've never seen before. Let's explore together.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGfG/"
