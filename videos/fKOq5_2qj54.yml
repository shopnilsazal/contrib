description: "Look Before You Import: A Webpack Survival Guide by Ross Kaffenberger\n\nPerhaps you've thought about switching to Webpack. Then you open a Webpack config file and your heart sinks; it looks like an alien life-form. You try to get it working, but your old jQuery plugins won't even load in the browser.\n\nMoving from Webpack basics to using it in production means understanding how it works. We'll demystify how Webpack bundles assets for the browser, how it differs from the Rails asset pipeline, and highlight common challenges that may occur coming from Sprockets.\n\nThis is the talk we would have wanted to see before recently adopting Webpack in our own Rails app."
