description: "by Michal Rostecki\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe idea of running virtual machines inside containers is surprisingly old andwas used due to several reasons. They include willingness to run VM-s incontainer orchestration engines like Kubernetes or Borg, or packaging IaaScloud software like OpenStack in containers. In this presentation, I am goingto describe these use cases and two main different approaches ofcontainerizing VM-s - putting every qemu(-kvm) process in a separate container(like Borg or Rancher OS are doing) and putting libvirtd process in container(like OpenStack Kolla or Stackanetes are doing)\n\n\nRoom: UA2.220 (Guillissen)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 15:10:00"
