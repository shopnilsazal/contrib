title: 'Garden City Ruby Conference - Immutability Matters'
recordingDate: 1423237060
description: "By, Ranjeet Singh\n\nThe Ruby codebase and standard libraries make heavy use of mutable objects, as does pretty much any mainstream language. Mutable objects are not thread-safe, comparatively harder to maintain and write tests for, and with the resulting tests being slow and brittle. Thus, it becomes very hard to understand applications and libraries written using mutable object states to pass values around and perform operation on those values. Immutability resolves a lot of concurrency issues (race conditions, dirty read/write etc.), and also simplifies the codebase and test cases.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GF2q/"
