description: "PyData London 2015\n\nDeep Learning is an exciting trend in machine learning, where neural networks of many layers “deep” can automatically learn features from large volumes of data, setting new standards for image, audio and language understanding. In this interactive session we will go over some of the most popular python libraries for deep learning and will train an actual deep neural nets end to end.\n\nSlides available here: http://www.slideshare.net/roelofp/python-for-image-understanding-deep-learning-with-convolutional-neural-nets"
