title: 'Wicked Good Ruby 2013 - Writing DSL''s with Parslet by Jason Garber'
recordingDate: 1383149051
description: "A well-designed DSL improves programmer productivity and communication with domain experts. The Ruby community has produced a number of very popular external DSLs--Coffeescript, HAML, SASS, and Cucumber to name a few.\n\nParslet makes it easy to write these kinds of DSLs in pure R ou'll learn the basics, feel out the limitations of several approaches and find some common solutions. In no time, you'll have the power to make a great new DSL, slurp in obscure file formats, modify or fork other people's grammars (like Gherkin, TOML, or JSON), or even write your own programming language!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG7G/"
