description: "Vitor Baptista\n\nWe'll go through the process of creating a new Python library supporting both Python2.7 and Python3.4+. We'll setup tox and pytest for testing in multiple environments, discuss about how to manage the dependencies (both for testing and running), test coverage with coveralls, mocking, linting to catch basic errors and keep the code quality and consistency, and multi-platform testing with Travis and Appveyor.\n\nBy the end of the talk, you'll understand how the different parts and libraries work together to provide a painless development."
