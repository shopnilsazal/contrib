description: "Scaling Organizations Using Kubernetes [I] - Richard Fliam, Comcast VIPER\n\nKubernetes enables us to build software that spans hundreds or thousands of machines in a simple manner. Often overlooked, but just as critical, is that Kubernetes can enable us to build software that scales across hundreds of developers. Kubernetes can enable us to scale organizations. \n\nIf you have gone from 5 to 250 people in 5 years like Comcast VIPER serious challenges will arise in deploying, monitoring, debugging, and preventing outages. The default solution for these challenges is process. However, with appropriate tooling and leveraging the underlying API’s of Kubernetes it is possible to automate much of this process. We can lighten the burden of developing large, multi component features and services. We will explore the steps VIPER is taking to leverage Kubernetes to effectively scale our organization.\n\nAbout Richard Fliam\nRichard Fliam is a software engineer with years of industry experience in developing large-scale distributed systems. His work ranges from CDNs, to video packagers, to multi-terabyte per second cloud video recorders. He now leads VIPER’s Engineering Efficiency group. He has previously presented at Gophercon."
