description: "This GDC 2017 session led by Anisa Sanusi explores the UX practice of \"Dark Patterns,\" user interfaces that have been carefully crafted to mislead players into behaviors that are detrimental to their experience but highly effective for monetary gain. Sanusi explores what \"Dark Patterns\" are, and looks at how good (effective) UX design could lead to a bad (unethical) UX result, and why game developers and UX designers must strive to avoid it.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
