title: 'Kelsey Jordahl - Mosaicking the Earth every day'

description: "Description\nPlanet's mission is to image the surface of the Earth every day. With over 140 Earth observation satellites currently in orbit imaging over 100 million square kilometers of land area per day, we are approaching that goal and expect to achieve it later this year. With a data pipeline built with open source tools, we process terabytes of data every data and manage an archive of petabytes.\n\nAbstract\nGlobal mosaics are created from Planet satellite images at regular intervals (quarterly, monthly, and weekly) by selecting the best quality scenes (e.g. cloud- and haze-free), color balancing, and seamlessly compositing millions of scenes to create continuous maps of the Earth for each time slice. As our data rate increases, we are scaling up the cadence of our mosaics, and plan to build a continuously updated \"dynamic\" mosaic of the most recent cloud-free images of the Earth. Daily data at 5 meter spatial resolution will open up new analysis techniques previously limited by the temporal or spatial resolution of existing instruments.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
