description: "Writing Open Source Documentation for Open Source Projects How SUSE is documented and what we can learn from it\nby Christoph Wickert\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nTo publish it's documentation, SUSE has developed not only a comprehensiveOpen Source toolchain to create and publish documentation but also an openworkflow that allows community and partners to provide feedback andcontribute. These tools and processes can easily be adopted by other projectsto write high quality software documentation.\n\nSUSE has been around as Linux vendor for a long time and from it's early daysonwards, delivered not only software but also the documentation to use it. Infact, SUSE is not only writing the documentation for it's own distributionsbut for upstream projects like OpenStack as well. Over time, the SUSEdocumentation team has developed not only a comprehensive, completely Free andOpen Source toolchain to create, edit, manage, and publish documentation butalso an open workflow that allows community and partners to provide feedbackand contribute. These tools and processes can easily be adopted by otherprojects to write high quality software documentation, everything from a manpage to a reference guide.\n\nIn this talk, Christoph will introduce the complete SUSE/openSUSEdocumentation workflow and tool chain. It will cover both the technicaldetails like formats, tools, or branching model and the organizational aspectssuch as the feature planning and tracking, distribution of work and feedbackprocess.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 11:30:00"
