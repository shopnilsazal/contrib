title: 'DEF CON 18 - Jeremy Brown - Exploiting SCADA Systems'
recordingDate: 1383936184
description: "Jeremy Brown - Exploiting SCADA Systems\nSCADA systems are just as vulnerable to attack today than they were ten years ago. The lack of security awareness by SCADA software vendors, combined with the rush of hacking these systems, make them very attractive to hackers today. The focus of this presentation will be showing the disconnect between SCADA software and secure programming. There will be a live demonstration of Sploitware, a framework dedicated to vulnerability analysis of SCADA systems. This framework could be thought of as a proof of concept, although you will see it is more than mature enough to prove the point.\n\nJeremy Brown is a computer security researcher employed at Tenable Network Security as a Vulnerability Research Engineer. Jeremy enjoys vulnerability research and analysis, exploit development, programming, fuzzing, and reverse engineering.\n\nTwitter: @jeremybrownn\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
