title: 'PyData Tel Aviv Meetup: Uncertainty in Deep Learning - Inbar Naor'
recordingDate: 1505749123
description: "Understanding what a model doesn’t know is important both from a practitioner point of view and for the end users of many different machine learning applications. However, traditional machine learning methods that handle uncertainty, such as Gaussian process, do not scale well, while deep learning models are typically used to get point estimates, leaving this kind of information out. In this talk I will talk about uncertainty, why it’s important and how can we incorporate bayesian thinking into deep learning.\n\nPyData Tel Aviv Meetup #7\n12 September 2017\nSponsored by Natural Intellengece\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
