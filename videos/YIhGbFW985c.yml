description: "Dmitry Trofimov - Python Debugger Uncovered\n[EuroPython 2014]\n[24 July 2014]\n\nThis talk will explain how to implement a debugger for Python. We'll start with setting a simple trace function, then look how it is implemented in modern IDEs like PyCharm and Pydev. \nThen we go further in the details and uncover the tricks used to implement some cool features like exception handling and multiprocess debugging.\n\n-----\n\nPresentation describes how to implement debugger for Python and has 4 parts:\n\n* Tracing Python code\n\n    Explains how to use trace function\n\n* Debugger Architecture\n\n    Explains which parts consists of a modern full-fledged debugger.\n\n* A Bit of Details\n\n    Explains how to make code to work for all python versions and implementations, survive gevent monkey-patching etc.\n\n* Cool Features\n\n    Explains how to implement exception handling and multiprocess debugging"
