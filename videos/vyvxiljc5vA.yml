title: 'Jacob Barhak - The Reference Model for Disease Progression'
recordingDate: 1402461186
description: "PyDat SV 2014 \nThe Reference Model for Disease progression is a league of disease models that compete amongst themselves to fit existing clinical trial results. Clinical Trial results are widely available publicly at the summary level. Disease models are typically extracted from a single trial and therefore may not generalize well to all populations. The Reference Model determines the fitness of multiple disease models for multiple populations and helps deduce better fitting scenarios. This is done using High Performance Computing (HPC) techniques that support Monte Carlo simulation at the Micro individual level."
