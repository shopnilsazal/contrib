title: 'Big Ruby 2013 Services and Rails: The Shit They Don''t Tell You by Brian Morton'
recordingDate: 1365716578
description: "Building services and integrating them into Rails is hard. We want smaller Rails apps and nicely encapsulated services, but services introduce complexity. If you go overboard in the beginning, you're doing extra work and getting some of it wrong. If you wait too long, you've got a mess.\n\nAt Yammer, we constantly clean up the mess that worked well in the early days, but has become troublesome to maintain and scale. We pull things out of the core Rails app, stand them up on their own, and make sure they work well and are fast. With 20+ services, we've learned some lessons along the way. Services that seem clean in the beginning can turn into development environment nightmares. Temporary double-dispatching solutions turn into developer confusion. Monitoring one app turns into monitoring a suite of apps and handling failure between them.\n\nThis talk looks at our mistakes and solutions, the tradeoffs, and how we're able to keep moving quickly. Having services and a smaller Rails codebase makes for scalable development teams, happier engineers, and predictable production environments. Getting there is full of hard decisions -- sometimes we're right, sometimes we fuck it up, but we usually have a story to tell.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGdQ/"
