description: "DEF CON 16 - Jan Newger: Anti-RE Techniques in DRM Code\nIn order to prevent music from being copied among consumers, content providers often use DRM systems to protect their music files. This talk describes the approach taken while analysing a DRM system (whose identity needs to be kept secret due to legal issues). It is shown what techniques were used to protect the system from being easily reverse engineered. This is not about how to hack $Insert_DRM_Here. No decryption tools or information on how to write one will be released.\n\nJan Newger has been enjoying Reverse Engineering for years and he is going to receive his diploma in CS towards the end of the year. He has been working on several software projects in the field of mechanical engineering. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
