description: "http://github.com/dutc/generators\n\nWhat are generators and coroutines in Python? What additional conceptualisations do they offer, and how can we use them to better model problems? This is a talk I've given at PyCon Canada, PyData Boston, and PyTexas. It's an intermediate-level talk around the core concept of generators with a lot of examples of not only neat things you can do with generators but also new ways to model and conceptualise problems."
