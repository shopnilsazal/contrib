description: "What it Means to Have Good Test Covearage, and why it Matters by Arjun Sharma\n\nOne of the greatest themes the Ruby community has embraced is testing. Countless words have been written, and tools coded, to make it as easy and painless as possible to write almost any kind of test imaginable. And yet despite all of the time we spend writing tests, we still end up with bugs in production, and we still curse our test suites for being too large, too slow, or too complicated.\n\nIn this talk I will not provide you with a single source of truth about how to test your application. What I will provide is a better understanding of how to get the most mileage out of your test suite. Using examples from my own experience of testing Rails, plain old Ruby, JavaScript, and even Objective-C and Java, we will explore the pros and cons of unit testing versus integrated or system testing, what makes a test valuable, and what it means to really have good test coverage.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/F0os/"
