description: "SensePost: A Tale of Two Proxies\n\n\nAbstract: During this presentation SensePost will discuss and demonstrate two pieces of new technology?the Suru WebProxy and the SP_LR Generic network proxy. The Suru web proxy is an inline web proxy (the likes of Paros, @stake webproxy and Webscarab) and offers the analyst unparalleled functionality. Are the days of the web proxy counted? Is there really room for another web proxy? Come to their presentation and see what happened when the guys at SensePost decided to develop a proxy with punch. SP_LR is a generic proxy framework that can be used for malware analysis, fuzzing or just the terminally curious. Its a tiny, generic proxy built on open-source tools with extensibility in mind at a low low price (GPL - Free as in beer). Both proxies serve distinct masters and will be valuable tools in any analysts arsenal. \n\nBios: Roelof Temmingh is the Technical Director of SensePost where his primary function is that of external penetration specialist.
