description: "Micro services are a wonderful thing! Until you try to test them in integration. Do you write a stub for each service? Point them to a test environment? Raise local instances for every dependency? I've tried all these approaches and they are all painful. Can't we can do better?\n\nYes we can! On this talk we will discuss Consumer Driven Contracts, a better way to deal with integration tests in a micro services environment.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/F0ou/"
