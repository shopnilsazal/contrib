title: '#HITB2018AMS D1T1 - Real World Attacks Against Secure Elements - Don Bailey'
recordingDate: 1524555039
description: "In the infamous movie Sneakers, our heroes face shadowy underworld black hats, spooky government spies, and their pasts. They do this all to retrieve a little black box designed to break American cryptographic secrets in seconds. Sneakers is rooted in the stereotypical idea that the ultimate hack is devising a single key that can unlock any system in the world. But, what if we’ve been looking at this threat model upside down?\n\nWhat if, instead, a company gave everyone a cryptographic black box, and that little black box was a key that opened up everyone’s network to abuse? What if the ultimate hack isn’t devising a single key that can open any lock… but manufacturing a lock that can be picked by anyone that understands gaps in deploying security-at-scale.\n\nThis talk will demonstrate a real world attack against a globally deployed Secure Element that allows any adversary to impersonate any device secured by the element, resulting in access to otherwise secured networks, and more.\n\nThe lecturer will not only give a live demonstration of the technology and the exploit, but will publish open source software that facilitates the attack (some of which he already published). The lecturer will also describe why the attack is successful, and common gaps in scaling secure elements for global deployments. Don will also describe how this attack was predicted by him and the GSMA team during the development of the IoT Security Guidelines, released in 2016.\n\nThis attack was submitted to the affected global corporation in the spring of 2017, and is in the last stages of mitigation.\n\n=== \n\nDon A. Bailey loves his baby boy Pierce, tacos, and IoT.\n\nHe is an internationally respected security researcher known for breaking ground in the mobile and embedded security spaces. Don has given over thirty unique lectures on various advances in security technology over the last eight years, both around the world and within the United States. His research has been highlighted on news exchanges such as CNN, Reuters, NPR, BBC, FOX, and CBS. Don was recently featured in the IEEE Security & Privacy magazine for his recent work reverse engineering M2M systems such as vehicle security modules. Previously the Research Director for a prestigious security firm, Mr. Bailey recently founded the consulting and engineering organization Capitol Hill Consultants LLC. At CHC, Don focuses on government contracting, global defense-centric engagements, and mobile security consulting."
