description: "PyData DC 2016\n\nGithub: https://github.com/h2oai/pydata2016-h2o-loganalysis\n\nH2O helps Python users make the leap from single machine based processing to large-scale distributed environments. Hadoop lets H2O users scale their data processing capabilities based on their current needs. Using H2O, Python, and Hadoop, you can create a complete end-to-end data analysis solution. In this presentation the speaker will show - and highlight a start to end process of how to design an algorithm, optimize, and implement it using H2O. The use case will focus much on the security work done between H2O and Capital One."
