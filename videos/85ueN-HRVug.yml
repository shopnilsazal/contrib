description: "PyData Carolinas 2016\n\nJohn Tukeyâ€™s stem-and-leaf plot first appeared in 1970. Although very useful back then, it cannot handle more than 300 data points and is completely text-based. Stemgraphic is a very easy to use python package providing a solution to these limitations. In this talk you will learn to use stemgraphic, see it in action with very large datasets and understand what drove the design decisions."
