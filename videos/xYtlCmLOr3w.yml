title: 'Capability Exchange: Improving Access Control Usability in Health IT'
recordingDate: 1378488855
description: "Chen Qin, Emily Freebairn, and Sean Smith, Dartmouth College\nPresented at the 2013 USENIX Workshop on Health Information Technologies\n\nClinicians report usability problems in modern health IT systems in part because the strictness of computerization eliminates the layer of informality which previously enabled them to get their jobs done. In this paper, we examine a solution by considering the strictly-enforced medical order as a security capability, and then using capability exchange to authorize frustrated end-users to re-introduce the necessarily flexibility. We prototype our idea using OpenEMR and Belay, and show how this prototype can address access control usability problems reported by clinicians."
