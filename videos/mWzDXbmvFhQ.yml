description: "PyData London 2018\n\nIn 2016 the UK government launched the world’s first “beneficial ownership” register; a requirement for all UK companies to register who controlled them. The register comprises of in excess of 4.5 million companies and 4 million individual people. We present how we built a graph database mapping the UK network of control structures using Python and a Neo4j graph database, and the first insights.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/AdamHill10/in-pursuit-of-hidden-owners-shining-a-light-on-uk-corporate-ownership\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
