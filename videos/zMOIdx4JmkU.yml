description: "Whatever the system you're working on it can probably be thought of as a living organism. You nourish it, extend it, add new abilities and inevitably it will depend on external factors to operate properly.\n\nIt's not uncommon for systems to have multiple dependencies on external services. This communication sometimes goes both ways - as well as being asynchronous a lot of the time - and appropriate actions should be taken when certain 'events' happen.\n\nThe way in which these 'events' are handled can be the difference between a clean, easy to reason about codebase and a tangled mess. Who never got stuck in callback hell?\n\nFunctional Reactive Programming provides better abstractions in such scenarios.\n\nIt models your system's behaviors as streams of values that change over time. In a functional setting, this allows streams to be filtered, mapped over, sampled, reduced and composed in a number of ways much like you compose pure functions.\n\nIn this talk you'll learn what's in it for you: how you can use FRP, what's its sweet spot as well as what tools are available to you.\n\nFor more on YOW!
