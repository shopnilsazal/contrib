description: "Jeffrey Prusan - Technical Security Countermeasures: The Real Story Behind Sweeping for Eavesdropping Devices\nTechnical Security Countermeasures: The Real Story Behind Sweeping for Eavesdropping Devices\n\nAs a corporate security advisor, former investigator, and TSCM technician, we will dispel the myths behing bugging and wiretapping. We will separate what tappers can and can not do (everything you see in the movies is not always true!!). What companies can do that will realistically protect themselves from eavesdropper and thereby help to protect their network, proprietary information, and intellectual property. We will explain and demonstrate the sophisticated electronic tools used by a professional sweep team, and describe what happens during the sweep process. We will demonstrate how phones are tapped in homes(analog phones), small businesses (KSU telephones systems), and larger companies (PBX systems). We will show how corporate spies attempt to infiltrate company telephone systems and ultimately compromise your network infra-structure. We show how anything purchased to detect eavesdropping from a \"spy shop\" will only waste your money and give you a false sense of security. We lay out the planning and execution of a successful sweep, and explain how to protect your company from threats in the future.\n\nJeffrey Prusan is the President of Corporate Defense Strategies Inc., a security consulting and security systems integration firm, founded in 1982, and located in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey.
