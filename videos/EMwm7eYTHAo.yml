description: "Beetle & Bruce Potter -Airsnarf - Why 802.11b Hotspots Ain't So Hot\nAirsnarf - Why 802.11b Hotspots Ain't So Hot\n\nAs wireless hotspots continue to pop up around the country, the opportunity to take advantage of the weakest point of this new networking fad becomes greater. What weak point is that? Why, the user, of course. Why sniff traffic, or crack WEP, or spoof MACs, when you can simply ASK for and easily receive usernames and passwords? Members of the Shmoo Group discuss how wireless miscreants can garner corporate or hotspot credentials the easy way: rogue access points. Additionally, a new utility will be provided to make rogue AP setups a cinch--with a twist. Little to no wireless knowledge is needed to understand how simple it is to never again pay for wireless hotspot access.\n\nBeetle is a member of the Shmoo Group, holds a BS in Computer Science, and is a D.C.-area computer security engineer. He is CEO of a Northern Virginia WISP, Vice President of the Capital Area Wireless Network, and licensed amateur racecar driver. His war-driving setup and adventures have been covered by The Washington Times, The Baltimore Sun, and NPR.\n\nBruce Potter is the founder of the Shmoo Group (www.shmoo.com), and the Capital Area Wireless Network (www.cawnet.org), a community wireless network group in the Washington D.C. area. He is the author of O'Reilly's \"802.11 Security\" book."
