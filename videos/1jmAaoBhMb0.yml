title: 'Kyle Shaffer - Code First, Math Later: Learning Neural Nets Through Implementation and Examples'
recordingDate: 1500906046
description: "Description\nThis talk will cover learning about neural networks through programming and experimentation. In particular, we will use the Keras library as a straightforward way to quickly implement popular neural network architectures such as feed-forward, convolutional, and recurrent networks. We'll also focus on internal data transformations within these networks, as information is passed from layer to layer.\n\nAbstract\nProgramming frameworks for implementing neural networks have become easy to use, and now allow for rapid prototyping and experimentation. These frameworks can also be used as teaching tools for those who are getting started in neural networks and deep learning. However, often students and practitioners start from textbooks and research papers in order to learn about these powerful techniques, and get bogged down in mathematical notation and jargon. This talk proposes a different approach through three high-level steps: 1. learning the basics of neural network architectures and applications, 2. experimenting with these models through code examples, and 3. revisiting the math and theory behind these models with a more practical understanding of how they work. We will focus mainly on architectures for three popular types of neural networks (feed-forward, convolutional, and recurrent), setting aside the issue of optimizing these networks during training.\n\nThis talk assumes some familiarity with supervised machine learning and classification, but assumes no prior knowledge of neural networks or deep learning. A familiarity with Python is beneficial, since this talk presents neural nets primarily from the perspective of programming using a high-level library. However, if you are familiar with another programming language or deep learning library, the concepts will likely make sense.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
