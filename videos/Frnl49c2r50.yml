description: "Make Money and Enjoy Freedom Creating a Software Business by Ryan MacInnes\n\nI'm by no means the best programmer (Most people probably wouldn't even consider me an expert) but I've managed to build and run a few successful software businesses. I created juicer.io, a social media aggregator, and I've attended YCombinator for another business.\n\nMy talk will be about the history of Juicer: why I started it, how I got there, and how I grew it. I'll also focus on the benefits of business ownership as opposed to traditional software engineering jobs. Finally I'll give my advice that I've learned through brute force and trial and error about idea generation, building, and most importantly growing a software based business.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Lg6P/"
