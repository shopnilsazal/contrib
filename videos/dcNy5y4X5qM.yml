description: "by Jean-Michel Friedt\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nWith the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) on the one hand, andthe availability of Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm [1] in theopensource Micmac [2, 3, 4] software suite (French National GeographicInstitute, IGN) for generating Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and orthophotoson the other hand, we describe the processing chain to acquire andgeoereference DEMs in QGIS. The fast acquisition and very high (sub-meter)resolution are well suited for repeated measurements and assess terrainmorphological changes. The processing sequence is\n\n  1. fly and acquire georeferenced images. If only a GPS receiver and camera are aboard the UAV, matching time tag with GPS date and time will allow for georeferencing the pictures (exiftool)\n\n  2. identify matching points between adjacent images: the GPS position is used to reduce the number of comparisons and limit the lengthy analysis to nearest neighbors\n\n  3. identify lens properties, bringing the largest cause of uncertainty in the model generation, from various pictures of the same ground feature exhibiting as much height variation as possible,\n\n  4. generate coarse point cloud to assess camera position and matching algorithm consistency\n\n  5. generate dense point cloud, orthophoto and DEM\n\n  6. include the resulting georeferenced pointcloud in QGis, converting the (arbitrary TIF) pixel value to quantitative height (meters).\n\nWe demonstrate sub-meter resolution DEM generation in vegetation-lessenvironments (urban, glacier moraine) while coarse-acquisition (C/A) single-frequency GPS only allows for 5-m accuracy, hence requiring an additionalground control point matching step for repeated DEM comparison.\n\nThis presentation is a shortened sequel to the [FOSS4G presentation given in2016](http://jmfriedt.free.fr/foss4g_2016) (in French at the moment) focusingon UAV azimutal images.\n\n[1] Nolan, M., Larsen, C.
