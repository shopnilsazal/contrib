recordingDate: 1475784642
description: "PyData Carolinas 2016\n\nThis talk will demonstrate an example application of using Celery to extract all of the lyrics of the inspiring and influential Taylor Swift from the Internet. Using a light-hearted approach and practical Python examples, we aim to teach people the basics of using Celery for data extraction.\n\nCelery is an open source, Python-based, asynchronous task framework which is well-suited for extracting data from webpages, APIs, and text files. With its power comes a bit of a learning curve. This talk covers some of the first questions a new Celery user might have. It will also point out some common pitfalls for beginning users."
