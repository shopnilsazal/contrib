description: "Tactical Fingerprinting Using Metadata, Hidden Info and Lost Data\nChema Alonso MVP Enterprise Security, CTO Inform·tica64\nJose Palazon \"Palako\" Yahoo!\n\nIn 2003 Tony Blair was \"bytten\" by a word document which its metadata demonstrated had been edited. Since that days a lot of advisories warning about to keep free of undesired data all published document shown up around the whole Internet... but times went by and people don't worry so much about this BIG problem. In this session you will see how analyzing all published documents in a website is possible to fingerprint a lot of (if not almost all) information about the internal network. This session will show you how to use FOCA tool to collect the files, gathering the information from ODF, MS Office, PDF/EPS/PS files, cross the information found with artificial intelligence rules and fingerprint big amount of info about the network structure, matching IP address with internal server names, printers, shared folders, ACLs...and to show how it can effectively be used by security consultants who traditionally could only offer source code fixes.\n\nChema Alonso is a Computer Engineer by the Rey Juan Carlos University and System Engineer by the PolitÈcnica University of Madrid. He has been working as security consultant last six years and had been awarded as Microsoft Most Valuable Professional since 2005 to present time.

Recently has been selected to be presenting in HackCon#4 in Norway, in SchmooCon 2k9 in Washington DC and in Black Hat Europe 2009.\n\nJose Palazon (Palako) is responsible for Mobile security worldwide at Yahoo!.
