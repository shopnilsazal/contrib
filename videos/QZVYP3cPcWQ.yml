description: "By Luke Melia\n\nAre you restarting your Rails server every time you deploy JavaScript? Are you waiting 5 minutes or more to deploy static JavaScript? Stop! We were able to cut our JavaScript front-end deployment times from more than 5 minutes to less than 15 seconds with zero downtime. As a bonus, we can preview new releases on production before making them live. I will share all the details of an approach you can implement on your Rails-backed Javascript app to make deploying JavaScript updates a joy.\n\nLuke Melia is Co-founder & CTO of Yapp & Yapp Labs. Luke discovered Ruby in 2005, is an active member of NYC.rb, co-organized the first GoRuCo, and was a co-author of Manning's \"Ruby in Practice\". He contributes regularly to Ember.js and organizes the Ember.js NYC Meetup .\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1r/"
