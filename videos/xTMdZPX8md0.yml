description: "Complement Deep Learning with Cheap Learning: Recent results of deep learning on hard problems has set the data world all a titter and made deep learning the fashion of the time.\n\nBut it is very important to remember that as data expands, the learning problems that are encountered are often nearly green field problems and it is often possible to solve these problems using remarkably simple techniques. Indeed, on many problems these simple techniques will give results as good as more complex ones, not because they are profound, but because many problems become simpler at scale.\n\nThat said, it isnâ€™t always obvious how to do this. I will describe some of these techniques and show how they can be applied in practice."
