This idea, that  civility is this unnecessary, superficial cellophane and bowtie that you put around what you say. We can be more effective if we just remove this pretty dress-up of our communication, and communicate facts in a structured manner. If someone is wrong, just tell them that they are wrong, donâ€™t dip it in sugar. \n\nHowever, Clarity and civility are not mutually exclusive. On the contrary, civility makes your message /more/ likely to be received by the other party, because you're optimising for the recipient."
