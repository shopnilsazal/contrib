description: "Speaker: Jan Jongboom (ARM)\n\nThe internet of things era is finally starting to happen! We have billions of smart devices coming, from smart factory plants to smart parking spaces, and from smart vending machines to smart toys. But… How can we, as ordinary web developers, ride this wave? We’ll need to know how to build embedded devices, build smartphone apps to go with them, and connect devices to the internet. And when we’re all done: how can people even discover our devices?!\n\nLots of challenges, but one great opportunity. With new tech coming out every day, it gets easier and easier to solve these problems. On the embedded spectrum we see JS engines appear that can run on microcontrollers with just 32KB of RAM, making it possible to run devices for years off a battery. And on the software spectrum Google and Mozilla have been working like crazy on Web Bluetooth, eliminating the need for an app per device. And on top of that: Physical Web, an open protocol that gives ordinary devices a URL, automatically popping up in your homescreen when you’re close to the device. How is that for discovery?\n\nIn this demo heavy talk, Jan Jongboom will balance the fine line between hardware and the web, showing how to get started on building connected devices on both embedded and web side using JavaScript. And while he’s at it, he’ll probably throw some stuff in the air."
