description: "ðŸ’– Support the show by becoming a Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/funfunfunction\n\nWe spend an hour making an attempt at speed-pair-programming (read: copy-pasting) a Facebook Messenger Bot in an hour.\n\nFrom no clue of the Facebook Developer documentation on Messenger Bots - to having SOMETHING live in production. \n\nProbably spending most of the time trying to log in to the production environment. And deploying. All the FUN of funfunfunctioning!\n\nStockholm Hotline is now offline because Facebook does not provide a way to revoke webhook keys. Sorry about that.\n\nBackground on the telecommunication hot line (in Swedish, use Google Translate):\nhttps://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heta_linjen_(telekommunikation) \n\nFacebook Developers Messenger Bot Getting Started guide:\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart\n\nNode.js hosting service Modulus:\nhttps://modulus.io/"
