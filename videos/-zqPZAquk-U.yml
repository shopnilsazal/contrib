title: 'Agile Roots 2010 - The New Methodology isn''t a Methodology'
recordingDate: 1423774110
description: "By: Alistair Cockburn\n\nWeâ€™re so used to talking about processes and methodologies in the form of big manuals, techniques and procedures from the 1980s and 1990s that we havenâ€™t noticed that the new methodologies arenâ€™t methodologies. They arenâ€™t even collections of practices. Theyâ€™re something else, something we donâ€™t yet have a word for. They incorporate a world view, practitioner promises for how to behave while getting work done, a few starter rules and an admission that the real work goes on between (hopefully) properly trained and skilled teammates. In this talk, Dr. Cockburn will introduce the problem we are having in talking about these non-methodologies, and show the shape of what is going on, as evidenced in Scrum and Crystal 2.0."
