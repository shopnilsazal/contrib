language: English
recordingDate: 1501623596
description: "IT teams today are under constant pressure to deliver more value sooner, and Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) is one of the more effective ways to help teams deliver the high quality software that their business needs. When they adopt BDD, many teams look to tools like Cucumber to help them. But BDD isnâ€™t simply about picking up a new tool.\n\nIn fact, there is a lot more to BDD than Given/When/Then and tools like Cucumber, and both can be misused. In this talk, we will take a step back and look at the bigger picture, and learn why using Gherkin at the wrong time, or for the wrong purpose, may be holding you back."
