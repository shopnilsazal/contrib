description: "A Peek Behind the Blue Mask: The Evolution of the SECTF \nChris Hadnagy\n\nJoin HumanHacker in an in-depth exploration of the mysterious world of the SECTF. From a small competition demonstrating a live compromise of fortune 500 companies to a full-scale village, how has the Social Engineering CTF evolved? What are the greatest takeaways from hosting 6 years of CTF competitions? It’s not often you get to hear what goes on behind the scenes. This informative talk will help social engineers, pentesters and future SECTF contestants alike understand how the Social Engineering CTF works. How are results calculated? What attack vectors have the highest success rate? What’s in a theme? What implications does the contest have for the world of SE and the state of corporate security? He’ll discuss expectations from the highest caliber social engineers and how he’s seen social engineering attacks evolve throughout the years. Part education, part documentary, this presentation is an ode to all things SE from the man who started it all.\n\nBIO: When struck by lightning Chris Hadnagy was transformed into loganWHD and infused with the power of social engineering and the ability to identify the weak point in any physical security system. Countering the natural instinct to use his powers for self gain, Chris has spent his time teaching others in the lost arts of many security topics and spreading knowledge through articles and interviews published in local, national, and international magazines and tv shows and books. Hidden amongst normal mortals as the Chief Human Hacker of Social-Engineer, Inc, Chris currently lives a hidden life as the lead developer of Social-Engineer.Org and is the author of a few books on social engineering. If you are in trouble, and no one else can help, you can contact Chris online at www.social-engineer.com or twitter at @humanhacker"
