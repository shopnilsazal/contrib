description: "by Leah Rowe\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nLibreboot is free/opensource boot firmware for laptops, desktops and servers,on multiple platforms and architectures. It replaces the proprietary BIOS/UEFIfirmware commonly foundin computers.\n\nLibreboot is a free/opensource boot firmware implementation for laptops,desktops and servers, on ARM and x86 (POWER8 and POWER9 is planned). Itreplaces the proprietary BIOS/UEFI firmware found in most PCs. We believe thatthis is an important goal to aim for, for reasons of security, privacy andfreedom in the user's computing, where, if we are successful and thrive, morepeople can use systems which do not have malicious anti-features, invasivebackdoors and other nasty quirks introduced by most modern proprietaryfirmware.\n\nLibreboot started in December 2013, as a response to the lack of other similarprojects. Its goal was (and is) to provide an easy way for the public toaccess free, libre computing. This includes the boot firmware, operatingsystem, drivers, applications and everything else.\n\nIt is based on coreboot, but we are also interested in using other projects asupstreams aswell, for other hardware. Libreboot is currently expanding, withan explosion of new hardware support on the horizon.\n\nLibreboot was also a GNU project, for a brief period, but it voluntarily leftthe GNU project over a fundamental disagreement with the FSF, regarding theiremployment practises. Libreboot is now its own independent project once more,with its own community and infrastructure.\n\nThe libreboot project is always looking for more people to get involved,especially skilled hardware hackers (companies welcome) who have experience orknowledge in low-level firmware development.\n\nLibreboot is funded by Minifree, which sells systems with Libreboot and Debianpreinstalled. https://minifree.org/\n\n\nRoom: K.1.105 (La Fontaine)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 16:00:00"
