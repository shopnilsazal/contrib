description: 'The tale of two languages: F# & Q# - Q# is a new language under development at Microsoft Research, specially designed for quantum computing. F# has played a significant role in helping the development of this language, both in terms of tools used and in terms of influencing paradigms in the language. In this talk, I''ll introduce some of the language features influenced by F#, and talk about the F# tools and concepts used, and finish with some personal notes of how my playing around with F# helped in my contributions to designing the language.'
