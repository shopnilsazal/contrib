title: 'Felix Wick: From the Life of a Data Scientist'
recordingDate: 1432992960
description: "T. Davenport and DJ Patil have pointed out already in 2012 that Data Scientists are working in the “sexiest job of the 21st century”. Although there are plenty of imaginations what a Data Scientist actually does, core skills for this job definitely include Machine Learning, software development, and business domain expertise.The talk will give a short tour through these key aspects and a glimpse of the working life of a Data Scientist at Blue Yonder. We build predictive applications for customers from various business fields or, to put it in another way, deliver productive data science as a service. Thereby, we make extensive use of the Python ecosystem and leverage it to overcome the two-language problem for rapid prototyping (instead of e.g. R) and productive operation (instead of e.g. C++) in different project phases.\n\nFelix Wick"
