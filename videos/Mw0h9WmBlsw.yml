description: "How do you get the clearest, most fluid animation in a 2D game and make it work with responsive gameplay? This talk from GDC 2014's Animation Bootcamp features Mariel Cartwright explaining how Skullgirls was animated. It covers the importance of strong key frames, anticipation and timing, and how you can effectively get these principles across when your designer says only have six frames to deliver a punch.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
