description: "RailsConf 2017: ​Recurring Background Jobs with Sidekiq-scheduler by Andreas Fast & Gianfranco Zas\n\nWhen background job processing needs arise, Sidekiq is the de facto choice. It's a great tool which has been around for years, but it doesn't provide recurring job processing out of the box. sidekiq-scheduler fills that gap, it's a Sidekiq extension to run background jobs in a recurring manner.\n\nIn this talk, we'll cover how sidekiq-scheduler does its job, different use cases, challenges when running on distributed environments, its future, how we distribute capacity over open source initiatives, and as a bonus, how to write your own Sidekiq extensions."
