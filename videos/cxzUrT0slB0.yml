title: 'Ruby Conf 2013 - Mangling Ruby with TracePoint by Mark Bates'
language: English
recordingDate: 1386272054
description: "Introduced in Ruby 2.0, TracePoint is meant to help developers better instrument their code for debugging and performance reasons, but there's more to TracePoint than that!\n\nIn this talk we'll learn about TracePoint while building several example projects. Once we know the basics we'll use TracePoint to do things to Ruby that we couldn't have done otherwise.\n\nBy the end of this talk you'll be able to frighten and amaze your friends when you show them things like true abstract classes and interfaces in Ruby, just like Java! Yikes!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG5B/"
