title: '#droidconDE 2015: Martin Knudsen â€“ Android Wear for beginners: A lunch tracker app'
recordingDate: 1433762392
description: "Find more information here: http://15.droidcon.de/session/android-wear-beginners-lunch-tracker-app\n\nThis talk will introduce beginners into the cool world of Android Wear using an example lunch tracker app.\n\nThis quick talk will show how basic Android Wear apps can be created using the new UI elements on the platform. A simple use case demostrated here is a lunch tracker to track what you had for lunch. When you are standing at the buffet or in the cafeteria and you are busy, you do not want to have to take out the phone from the pocket, turn it on, unlock the phone, find the app, open the app, enter data, turn off the screen, put phone in pocket. Here a wearable app could do this much faster. \n\nThe example app will demonstrate UI elements such as using listviews, confirmation screens, buttons and layouts, and multiple fragments and databases plus speech recognition on an Android Wear device.\n\nAll source code will be available for the public to download later with no strings attached."
