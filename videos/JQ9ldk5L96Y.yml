description: 'Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and, more generally, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) wireless communications enable semi-autonomous driving via the exchange of state information between a network of connected vehicles and infrastructure units. Following 10+ years of standards development, particularly of IEEE 802.11p and the IEEE 1609 family, a lack of available implementations has prevented the involvement of the security community in development and testing of these standards. Analysis of the WAVE/DSRC protocols in their existing form reveals the presence of vulnerabilities which have the potential to render the protocol unfit for use in safety-critical systems. We present a complete Linux-stack based implementation of IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609.3/4 which provide a means for hackers and academics to participate in the engineering of secure standards for intelligent transportation systems.'
