description: "by Daniel Pocock\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nRTC development is a very specialized topic. Developers working in this fieldoften have to make a serious time commitment to know it well and keep up withall the new things that are happening. This implies that people need to focuson projects that pay their wages. The projects that pay are not always theprojects that deliver the best results for the wider community though. In thissession, we will look at the opportunities that crowdfunding and other schemesmay provide to help RTC developers spend some of their work hours on projectsfor the greater good.\n\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 17:10:00"
