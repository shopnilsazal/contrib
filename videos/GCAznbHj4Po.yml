The Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel® DAAL) is a C++ and Java software solution for data analytics. The library provides a set of optimized building blocks that can be used in all stages of the data analytics workflow. A prototype Python profiler will be featured, with details on the highlights and advantages of this tool. Another project in the works is a Python Distribution for scientific computing and data analysis, that leverages the power of Intel® Math Kernel library (Intel® MKL) to deliver faster performance. A quick spotlight on the latest features and additions to the Intel ® Performance Libraries – Intel® MKL and Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel® IPP). And finally, a fresh look at the Intel free tools software program, to discover some of the free offerings for academic researchers, educators, students and open source contributors."
