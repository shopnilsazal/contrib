recordingDate: 1433524561
description: "Find more information here: http://droidcon.de/session/android-forensics-how-police-investigates-your-device\n\nEver wondered how the Police is analyzing the communication traces on a criminal case? My trips in the latest years brought me in contact with companies in security area from Europe, Russia, China and Malaysia. Teaching Android Internals for national security agencies forced me to align the Android Internals knowledge with the forensics on Android devices. \n\nI will demo how the Android Internals are constructed and how the police force can extract from an Android device sensitive informations. I will demo the way they can hack into a phone internals using Android platform features like: Binder, Kernel architecture, file system, ADB.\n\nThe presentation will be backed-up by a practical lab where we analyze live a device from audience."
