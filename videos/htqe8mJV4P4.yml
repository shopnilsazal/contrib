description: "Third Party Dynamic Volume Provisioners - Jan Šafránek, Red Hat\n\n\"Kubernetes 1.4 introduces an API for dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes by third party provisioners. Any storage vendor, big or small, open or proprietary, can write a standalone plugin that can provision storage for Kubernetes. The plugin can live outside of Kubernetes source tree, running on any platform and be written in any language, as long as it can talk to Kubernetes using REST protocol. In this tutorial, we will write a simple provisioner using a prepared skeleton written in Go language and we will handle all possible corner cases that the plugin needs to deal with in a highly dynamic system such as Kubernetes.\n\nSome user experience with Kubernetes is strongly desired. Golang knowledge is not required, code samples should be universally understandable to anyone with a programming experience.\"\n\nAbout Jan Šafránek\nJan is principal software engineer in Red Hat Inc., currently working on storage aspects of Kubernetes. He’s focused on development and maintenance of open source software with focus on system management."
