description: "Up And Down Again: A Migration's Tale by Derek Prior \n\nYou run rake db:migrate and rake db:schema:load regularly, but what do they actually do? How does rake db:rollback automatically reverse migrations and why can't it reverse all of them? How can you teach these tasks new tricks to support additional database constructs?\n\nWe'll answer all of this and more as we explore the world of schema management in Rails. You will leave this talk with a deep understanding of how Rails manages schema, a better idea of its pitfalls, and ready to bend it to your will."
