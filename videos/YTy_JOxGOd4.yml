description: "RustConf 2016 - Integrating Some Rust in VLC Media Player by Geoffroy Couprie\n\nVLC media player has a nice goal for users: handle almost any file or protocol you throw at it. Unfortunately, this results in a lot of parser vulnerabilities, because most of the parsing code is handwritten in C. By leveraging Rust and the nom parser combinators library, could we replace some security critical parts of VLC?"
