description: 'Over the next ten years, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies will fundamentally change the delivery of care around the globe. The blockchain provides a technical framework where trust is moved from central controlling intermediaries to the open source protocol, freeing data and assets from the control of traditional corporate interests. The great hope is that this evolution will result in the empowerment of consumers, communities, and markets centered on sustainable wellness and environments of health. The coming years represent a unique opportunity to make sure blockchain-based global health initiatives are structured in a way that re-constructs our broken system in a way that improves the lives of individuals and the communities in which they live.'
