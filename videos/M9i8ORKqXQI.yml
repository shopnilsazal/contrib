title: 'The Future of Event-driven Microservices with Spring Cloud Stream by Kenny Bastani'

description: "When youâ€™re building microservices, managing state becomes a distributed systems problem. Instead of being able to manage state as transactions inside the boundaries of a single monolithic application, a microservice must be able to manage consistency by using transactions that are distributed across a network of many different applications and databases.\n\nEvent-driven architectures are a key component of solving data consistency issues in microservices. This session explores the problems of data consistency in microservices and the various event-driven practices that include CQRS and Event Sourcing. We will look at how these popular practices are implemented using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Stream."
