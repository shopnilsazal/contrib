description: "Theo Schlossnagle, Circonus\n\nIn this presentation we'll re-examine monitoring to understand how to formulate valuable goals and align monitoring design and implementation with those goals. With a focus on outcomes and behavior that leads to outcomes we'll focus on performance data and not security monitoring.\n\nAttendees will learn to ask the right questions when approaching the monitoring of systems and businesses. They will understand why and how monitoring should fit into the overall systems architecture to reduce risk and increase value.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
