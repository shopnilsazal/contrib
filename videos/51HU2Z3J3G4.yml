title: 'PyData Tel Aviv Meetup: Fundamentals of Deep Learning based ‘Object Detection’ - Idan Bassuk'
recordingDate: 1505747553
description: "For those of you looking for large technological and commercial opportunities to build your next product or startup, I really believe that ‘Object Detection’ could be THE challenge you are looking for. \n\nThis technology has already proven its maturity in a number of verticals, and there are still many unexploited applications in several huge markets that are yet to adopt this technology. Applications of ‘Object Detection’ could potentially augment humans in many tasks that currently require human eyesight. That considered, I believe that the object detection technology will serve as a key component in the disruption of many areas including Healthcare, Defense & Surveillance, Drones, Photography, Augmented Reality, Construction and more.\n\nDuring this talk I aim to give you a thorough review of the State-of-the-Art algorithms and share the recommended system-design guidelines for those of you who are interested in building your own products using this technology.\n\nFurther Motivation for the Talk: \n\nThe state-of-the-art performance of algorithms for ‘Object Detection’ in images has been continuously improving over the past few years (and even months), thanks to the achievements of some of the strongest Deep Learning teams in the world.\n\nLuckily for us, most of their work has been done on “everyday images”, and there is a lot of room left for innovation by adapting these algorithms to new domains.\n\nFurthermore, these algorithms, while complex, can be understood by mere humans like us, and can even be implemented and advanced.  \n\nPyData Tel Aviv Meetup #7\n12 September 2017\nSponsored by Natural Intellengece\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
