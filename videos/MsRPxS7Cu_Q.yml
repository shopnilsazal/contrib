description: "by Stephan Hagemann\n\nComponent-based Rails helps you regain control over your sprawling Rails application. It helps you structure your new Rails application in a way that it will stay more manageable longer. It helps you think completely differently about writing applications - not just in Ruby and Rails!\n\nThis session will help you pass the initial hurdle of getting started with component-based Rails. While there is nothing really new, there is a lot that is just a little different. We will go over those differences so your start with component-based Rails is a smooth one."
