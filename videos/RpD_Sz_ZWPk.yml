description: "Paul Graham, Inequality and Risk\n\nPrevious attempts to hack the connection between wealth and power have aimed mainly at eliminating economic inequality. They've all ended in disaster, because economic inequality is closely related to risk: you can't eliminate inequality without eliminating startups, and with them growth. So if you want to get rid of injustice, the place to attack is one step downstream, where wealth turns into power.\n\nPaul Graham is the author of On Lisp, Ansi Common Lisp, and Hackers & Painters; was co-founder of Viaweb (now Yahoo Store); developed a simple Bayesian spam filter that inspired many present filters; and is one of the partners in Y Combinator."
