description: "Gaël Varoquaux - Scientist meets web dev: how Python became the language of data\n[EuroPython 2016]\n[22 July 2016]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/keynote-science-web-dev)\n\nData science is a hot topic and  Python has emerged as an ideal language for it.\nIts strength for data analysis come from the cultural mix between the\nscientific Python community, and more conventional software usage,\nsuch as web development or system administration. I'll show how and\nwhy Python is a easy and powerful tool for data science.\n\n-----\n\nPython started as a scripting language, but now it is the new trend\neverywhere and in particular for data science, the latest rage of\ncomputing. It didn't get there by chance: tools and concepts built by\nnerdy scientists and geek sysadmins provide foundations for what is\nsaid to be the sexiest job: data scientist.\n\nIn my talk I'll give a personal perspective, historical and technical,\non the progress of the scientific Python ecosystem, from numerical\nphysics to data mining. What made Python suitable for science; How\ncould scipy grow to challenge commercial giants such as Matlab; Why\nthe cultural gap between scientific Python and the broader Python\ncommunity turned out to be a gold mine; How scikit-learn was born,\nwhat technical decisions enabled it to grow; And last but not least,\nhow we are addressing a wider and wider public, lowering the bar and\nempowering people.\n\nThe talk will discuss low-level technical aspects, such as how the\nPython world makes it easy to move large chunks of number across code.\nIt will touch upon current exciting developments in scikit-learn and\njoblib. But it will also talk about softer topics, such as project\ndynamics or documentation, as software's success is determined by\npeople."
