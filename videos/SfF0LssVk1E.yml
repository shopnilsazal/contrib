description: "Gene Cronk, IPv6 Primer\nThe IPv6 Primer will encompass the basics of IPv6, including some of its roots, the transitioning mechanisms available, and some security concerns early adopters should be aware of in several different environments. This presentation is meant for anyone who has heard about IPv6, but would like to know the basics of the protocol and its implementation.\n\nGene Cronk, CISSP, NSA-IAM, resides in Jacksonville, FL and is currently providing system administration services to an advertising and marketing firm.\n\nHe has 10 years of experience in electronics, system administration, networking and system security. Gene is best known for his work on the North American IPv6 Task Force, and his work on\nFu King Linux (an IPv6 enabled distribution of Linux), which includes security tools that can be run in IPv4 or IPv6 environments. He has also spoken on IPv6 and other topics at several venues.\n\nWhen not totally absorbed by system security related issues, Gene can be found wardriving, actively participating as Vice President of the JaxLUG, and building a successful and dynamic 2600\nchapter, of which he is currently president."
