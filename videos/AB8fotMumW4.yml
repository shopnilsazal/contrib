description: "by Martijn Dashorts \r\n\r\nApache Wicket is a component oriented Java web framework. With proper mark-up/logic separation, a POJO data model, and a refreshing lack of XML, Wicket makes developing web-apps simple and enjoyable again.\r\n\r\nThis talk provides a short introduction to the framework's concepts: components, behaviors and models. We'll take a short look at integrating with Spring and integrating with JQuery. For the test infected we'll cover testing your web pages with Wicket's internal test framework. But most importantly we'll take a look at the new Wicket release 1.5 and see what has changed for the better and worse\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
