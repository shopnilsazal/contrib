description: "DevOpsDays Boston 2017- Real-World Kubernetes For DevOps by Phil Lombardi\n\nMicroservices is an increasingly popular approach to building cloud-native applications. Dozens of new technologies that streamline adopting microservices development such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Envoy have been released over the past few years. But how do you actually use these technologies together to develop, deploy, and run microservices?\n\nIn this presentation, we’ll cover the nuances of deploying containerized applications on Kubernetes, including creating a Kubernetes manifest, debugging and logging, and how to build an automated continuous deployment pipeline. Then, we’ll do a brief tour of some of the advanced concepts related to microservices, including service mesh, canary deployments, resilience, and security."
