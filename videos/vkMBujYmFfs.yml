description: "by Miklos Mukka Szel\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nDAMP: Docker is the component that makes the whole environment portable (onlybash and Docker needed to set it up) Ansible is an agentless config managementsystem that makes the whole setup automated and painless ProxySQL is a risingstar on MySQL's horizon giving full control to DBAs over queries before theyhit the DBs. MHA is an proven MySQL HA solution that's easily customizable\n\nMy aim with this demo/repo is to show people how easy to set up a testenvironment with to test a really good MySQL HA/Proxy solution.\n\nAttendees will gain insight into how to leverage Ansible plays to automatemany tasks for managing a highly available MySQL environment with the abilityof read/write split, load balancing, on-the-fly query rewrite(ProxySQL). We'regoing to demonstrate scenarios like: \\- Building HA environment in 3 minutes\\- ProxySQL auto dynamic config generation with Ansible \\- failover withoutlosing a single SELECT\n\nA fully working Ansible playbook will be available for the attendees runningin Docker\n\n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 13:35:00"
