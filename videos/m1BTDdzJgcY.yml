description: "By, Florain Fuchs \nGNU Mailman, the popular mailing list manager has undergone a major redesign. One of the changes is the separation of the web user interfaces from the core engine and the use of Django for list management and archiving.\n\nThis talk shows how these interfaces use Mailman's internal APIs, how they can be integrated into existing Django projects and how they can be customized and extended.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FNEp/"
