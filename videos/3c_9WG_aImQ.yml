description: "RubyConf 2017: The overnight failure by Sebastian Sogamoso\n\nClose your eyes and imagine what is the worst thing that could happen to you at work. For me, that was charging users thousands of times the amount they should have been charged. In this talk we will find out what caused this particular bug and what we learnt from dealing with the whole situation.\n\nDid someone get fired? Did the company survive the bug? Come to the talk and you will learn the answers, but more importantly a thing or two about how to go through tough times at work."
