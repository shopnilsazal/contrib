Our team does this in order to waste less time hunting down problems in *monster merges*.\n \nMonster merges\nMerging code into master almost always results in some problems and finding a problem in code is often like finding a needle in a haystack, especially if the haystack is this monster merge. \n \nMultiple merges per day\nThe philosophy of our team that practices continuous integration is making the haystacks very small, by having a habit of doing *multiple merges per day*. \n \nAutomated verification system\nBut in order to pull that off, the time and cost overhead of every merge must made low. To achieve that our team uses an *automated verification system* that *quickly* and *automatically* checks every merge for problems."
