description: "Michael Kehoe and Nina Mushiana, LinkedIn\n\nJust over two years ago, I completed college, moved countries and started as a SRE at LinkedIn. Over those two years, I’ve gone from a Junior engineer to a Senior Engineer, however, I wouldn’t have been able to do it without a great onboarding experience and the mentors that have guided me\n\nThis session will take the perspective of myself as a New College Graduate and Nina Mushiana (SRE manager) on how to onboard new SREs and help them reach their full potential. We will deep dive into onboarding, mentoring and training topics and reflect on lessons learnt over my two year experience. Finally I’ll present advice for ELTs on how to become an important and successful part of their organization."
