description: "By Javier Ramirez\n\nWhen David Heinemeier Hansson started talking about REST in 2006, little could we suspect it'd become such a central part of Rails (and of web development in general). Back then a web service meant something you coded using XML and SOAP. Those were dark times. REST changed it all.\n\nIn this talk, I'll explain REST for beginners, I'll talk about why it is such an important architecture, and I'll show all the nice things Rails offers you for building a RESTful application or a RESTful API.\n\nWeb developer, daydreamer and all around happy person.\n\nFounder of https://teowaki.com where we try to make developers happier by helping them share technical information, best practices, gossip and lifehacks with their developer friends.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1y/"
