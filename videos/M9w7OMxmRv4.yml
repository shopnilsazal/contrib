title: 'LoneStarRuby Conf 2013 - Neural Networks with RubyFANN by Ethan Garofolo'
recordingDate: 1376955585
description: "Neural networks (NNs) not only sound really cool, but they can also solve some pretty interesting problems ranging from driving cars to spam detection to facial recognition.\n\nSolving problems with NNs is challenging, because actually implementing a NN from scratch is difficult, and knowing how to apply it is more difficult. Fortunately, libraries, such as RubyFANN, exist to handle the first problem. Solving the second problem comes from experience.\n\nThis talk will show a few different approaches to applying NNs to such problems as spam detection and games, as well as discussing other areas where NNs might be a useful solution.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8g/"
