description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nContinuous Delivery Meets Custom Kubernetes Controller: A Declarative Configuration Approach to CI/CD - Suneeta Mall & Simon Cochrane, Nearmap (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nBuilding and maintaining streamlined continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines is often challenging. It is even harder on Kubernetes since the deployments are, rightfully so, safely guarded by the API Server of the cluster. Organizations tend to lockdown the API Server, restricting the ability to use an external CI tool. Using external CI tools thus comes at a cost of security, access, and ease-of-use. Nearmap dealt with these challenges using intrinsic Kubernetes principles. We use CircleCI, Amazon Web Service (AWS) Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and a custom Kubernetes controller to achieve a declarative configuration approach to continuous deployment. In this talk, we discuss the challenges faced, provide an in-depth analysis of our declarative CI/CD approach and how Nearmap is enabling self-managed continuous deployments of Kubernetes clusters.\n\nAbout Suneeta\nSuneeta Mall is a Senior Software Engineer at Nearmap – a leading provider of high resolution aerial imagery. She is leading the efforts of containerizing and migrating Nearmap services to Kubernetes (on Amazon Web Services) from Amazon’s Elastic Compute. In her 10 years of software industry experience, she has worked on solving variety of challenging technical and business problems in the field of DevOps, Tele-communication, travel, GIS, big data and machine learning. She has actively contributed to innovation portfolio of IBM (where she has worked before) and is also a Doctoral candidate at University of Sydney.\n\nAbout Simon\nSimon is a Director of Engineering at Nearmap specializing in providing high resolution aerial imagery over the web and embracing the Kubernetes world in order to efficiently run services in the cloud. Simon has inhabited the Sydney startup space for over 15 years building everything from social network apps to virtual ISP provisioning software."
