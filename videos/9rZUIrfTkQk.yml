title: 'Lightning Talks for the One-Track Mind'
recordingDate: 1413482032
description: "Because it is not possible for a Symposium participant to attend every talk, the lightning talks allow attendees to get a taste of most papers in a single session. Authors of each paper have been invited to energize fellow attendees with a 60-second lightning talk video without Q&A. Thus most papers will strike twice in the same conference.\n\nPresented at USENIX Security '14"
