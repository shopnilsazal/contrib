description: "In this GDC 2017 talk, Arkane Studios' Steve Lee advocates for a holistic approach to level design where level designers not only think about many aspects of the player's experience (primarily gameplay, presentation and story), but focus specifically on how all of these things work together. \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
