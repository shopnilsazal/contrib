Windows 8 Secure Boot provides an important protection against bootkits by enforcing a signature check on each boot component.\n\nThis talk will detail and organize some of the attacks and how they work. We will demonstrate a full software bypass of secure boot. In addition, we will describe underlying vulnerabilities and how to assess systems for these issues using chipsec (https://github.com/chipsec/chipsec), an open source framework for platform security assessment. We will cover BIOS write protection, forensics on platform firmware, attacks against SMM, attacks against secure boot, and various other issues. After watching, you should understand how these attacks work, how they are mitigated, and how to test a system for the vulnerability.\n\nYuriy Bulygin is a Chief Threat Architect. Over the past 8 years he has enjoyed analyzing the security of everything from OS to CPU microcode and hardware. He is now leading a security threat research team, advancing research in security threats to modern PC, mobile, and embedded platforms and protections.\n\nTwitter: @c7zero\n\nOleksandr Bazhaniuk is a security researcher and reverse engineer with background in automation of binary vulnerability analysis. He is also a co-founder of DCUA, the first DEF CON group in Ukraine.\n\nTwitter: @ABazhaniuk\n\nAndrew Furtak is a security researcher focusing on security analysis of firmware and hardware of modern computing platforms and a security software engineer in the past. Andrew holds a MS in Applied Mathematics and Physics from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.\n\nJohn Loucaides is a security researcher who is currently focusing on responding to platform security issues. He has performed security analysis for a wide variety of targets from embedded systems to enterprise networks, developing repeatable methods for improving assurance."
