description: "Sebastian Kirsch, Google Switzerland GmbH\n\nHow do you perform up to 70 product and feature launches per week safely and reliably? Google staffed a dedicated team of Site Reliability Engineers to solve this question: Launch Coordination Engineers (LCEs) work across Google's service space to audit new products and features for reliability, act as liaisons between teams involved in a launch, and be gatekeepers. Google designed its launch process to be easy on developers, scalable and provide a consistent bar for reliability at launch. A common checklist helped making the results of a launch review reproducible. This launch checklist was later automated into a self-service tool curated by the LCE team and re-used by other teams. The specialisation on the challenges of launching enabled the LCE team to build a breadth of experience in applicable techniques and allowed them to function as vehicles for knowledge transfer between different parts of the company.\n\nAttendees will learn about challenges unique to launch situations, the advantages of a dedicated LCE team, how to structure a launch process, the outline of a launch checklist, and select techniques for successful launches.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
