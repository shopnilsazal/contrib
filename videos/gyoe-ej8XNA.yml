recordingDate: 1525249449
description: "Using SSL/TLS the right way is often a big hurdle for developers. We prefer to have that one colleague perform \"something with certificates\", because he/she knows how that works. But what if \"that one colleague\" is enjoying vacation and something goes wrong with the certificates?\n\nIn this session we'll take a close look at secure communication at the transport level. Starting with what exactly SSL and TLS is, we'll dive into public/private keys, and signing. We'll also learn what all this has to do with an unfortunate Dutch notary. Of course, there'll be plenty of practical tips & trics, as well as demo's.\n\nAttend this session to become \"that one colleague\"!"
