description: "Ne0nRa1n & Julian Spillane: Hack your brain with video games\n\nVideo games are the most effective and accessible tool for hacking your physical and mental state, yet the potential impact of these technologies has yet to be exploited. In this presentation we will take you on a journey through video games -past, present and future-, dispelling the myths and emphasizing the realities, both positive and dark. We will also explain how different input devices can be used to improve the brain and how to hack together your own input framework to take advantage of these innovative peripherals.\n\nThis presentation will focus on the various opportunities of such hardware, especially biofeedback devices, in gaming and the positive effects that these technologies can have on our brains and bodies. We will also be presenting some code for expanding and accepting peripherals outside of the norm; as well as a demo of the technology, Biofeedback Tetris, making use of heart-rate monitoring and a measure of galvanic skin response to enhance game-play.\n\nNe0nRa1n is your run-of-the mill visionary dancing monkey whose interests lie in neuroscience, psychology, and yummy sugary snacks. Stumbling without purpose in the computer underground for a decade now, she has never graduated from any secondary institution, has never held down a job of any great importance, and spends most days trying not live up to her potential.\n\nJulian Spillane is the co-founder and CEO of game development company Frozen North Productions, Inc. Julian attended the University of  Waterloo for Software Engineering and has taken a great interest in applying principles of engineering design to software development in the games industry. After working on contract with the Department of National Defence, Julian went on to do contract work for various game development houses and eventually formed his own studio. Julian is also the founder and Chair of the Toronto Independent Games Conference, a conference dedicated to bringing together independent\ngame developers, students, and hobbyists to discuss various facets of  the industry, improve skills and encourage networking."
