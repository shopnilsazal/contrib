description: "Online phishing campaigns are one of the most typical social engineering exercises that can be \nconducted in the internet. In spite of the easiness with which fake websites can be deployed using tools such as Social Engineering Toolkit, attackers will sometimes be limited by the difficulties to achieve a sufficient amount of privacy in the case of being trapped. Thus, finding a set of platforms that can provide this anonymity and untraceability is needed to launch similar campaigns with the minimum guarantees of remaining safe.\n\nIn this session, the authors will show a proposal on how to perform this type of attacks with the example of credential harvesting in mind by  using some of the well known capabilities that the Tor ecosystem provides. During the conference, some demos will be conducted in which our baits will be prepared to be bitten by even users which are not using tor-ified browsers, by adding some simple tricks that include the exploitation of the target=”_blank” directive, the particular use of .onion subdomains in current browsers and a combination of third party gateways to maximize the chances of deceiving the victim while the attacker remains as anonymous as possible."
