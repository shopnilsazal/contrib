title: 'Rocky Mountain Ruby 2012 - Refactoring from Good to Great by Ben Orenstein'
recordingDate: 1354151361
description: "Most developers know enough about refactoring to write code that's pretty good. They create short methods, and classes with one responsibility. They're also familiar with a good handful of refactorings, and the code smells that motivate them.\n\nThis talk is about the next level of knowledge: the things advanced developers know that let them turn good code into great. Code that's easy to read and a breeze to change.\n\nTopics include:\n\nThe Open-Closed Principle\nThe types of coupling, and their dangers\nPowerful refactorings like the Method Object\nThe beauty of the Decorator pattern\nTesting smells, including Mystery Guest and stubbing the system under test\nThe stuff from the last halves of Refactoring and Clean Code that you never quite got to :)\nThese topics will be covered solely by LIVE CODING; no slides. We'll boldly refactor right on stage, and pray the tests stay green. You might even learn some vim tricks as well as an expert user shows you his workflow.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGel/"
