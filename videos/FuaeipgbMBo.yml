description: "Brian Lagunas, Ariel Ben Horesh\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/dotnetfringe/sdkxmg/\nPrism was a long time patterns&amp;practices guidance project. \nRecently P&amp;P had transferred ownership to the community.\nWhat does it mean for the project? where is it headed? What about Prism for Windows Runtime?\nAll those are great questions that we will try to answer in this session. \nIf you have used Prism for WPF from day 1 or just now learning about it, it&#39;s likely Prism can benefit your project, with best practices implementation and guidance."
