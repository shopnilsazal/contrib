description: "John \"jur1st\" Benson: Bridging the Gap Between Technology and the Law\nThe recent case of Julie Amero has cast a bright spotlight on the difference in understanding between the worlds of technology and the law. We will examine adoption of technology within the legal profession, trial court decisions, as well as legislative and appellate decisions which may be inconsistent with generally accepted security measures.\n\nJohn Benson is the co-chair of the Kansas City Metropolitan Bar Association Computer Law and Technology Committee, adjunct professor at the Colorado Technical University, and an electronic discovery analyst at a large midwestern law firm. While in law school he excelled in the areas of evidence and trial advocacy, produced papers on the Sony XCP Rootkit and NSA warrantless wiretapping program, and was a general menace to the local network administrators."
