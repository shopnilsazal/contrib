description: "Would you like to stroll into the office to your own dramatic theme music? We can arrive in style with an epic score. Learn how to use RubyMotion, a Raspberry Pi and iBeacon Technology to play the Imperial March when the CEO walks in.\n\nThe ability for mobile devices to detect their proximity to beacons is relatively new. We will learn how they work, the common gotchas, and how to integrate with a bigger system.\n\nLet's build something fun with Ruby and Beacons. Plus, who doesn't want an awesome theme song?\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FixE/"
