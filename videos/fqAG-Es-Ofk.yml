recordingDate: 1502694905
description: 'Traditionally, Java developers have a strong dislike for JavaScript. Justifiably so, of course. JavaScript lacks a range of features that we all know and love in Java. However, JavaScript has been gradually taking over the frontend landscape. Since JavaScript is the native language of the browser and the browser is available on all devices, the relevance of JavaScript is no longer in question. The only question is how to choose the right tools for the job, since the JavaScript ecosystem is filled with a wide range of technologies, libraries, and tools. In this session, you will learn how the speaker, a Java developer, has bit by bit, over time, come to like JavaScript. Not so much the language, but the ecosystem and the range of possibilities available. By the end of the session, you will have a thorough perspective on everything the JavaScript ecosystem can do for you, as a Java developer, and how you can make sense of the instability/vibrancy of the JavaScript ecosystem, too.'
