description: "HotSpot promises to do wonders for us by Just-in-Time (JIT) compiling the \"right\" code for us, but how does it makes those decisions? And, perhaps more importantly, what happens when it's wrong?\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn through real code examples just how the JVM decides to compile your code, deoptimize your code, and stop-the-world for a GC."
