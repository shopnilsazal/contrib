description: "Walter C. Daugherity - Quantum Computing 101: How to Crack RSA\nThe brand-new technology of quantum computers offers the prospect of exponential speedup, making heretofore infeasible problems like cracking RSA conceiveable. The fundamentals of quantum computing are presented, and how a quantum computer could be used to crack RSA is described.\n\nDr. Walter C. Daugherity is a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M University. He received a bachelor's degree from Oklahoma Christian University, and master's and doctor's degrees from Harvard University. His research interests include fuzzy logic, object-oriented programming, and quantum computing. With David A. Church he created the first course in quantum computing at Texas A&M University, which will be offered for the third time in the fall semester this year."
