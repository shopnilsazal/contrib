description: 'At Uber, we use data for nearly everything from influencing policy to building products and gleaning market insights. However, the data alone doesn''t always tell the full story. Color, composition, and framing play a critical role in developing a narrative that helps connect emotionally and visually with your audience. During our June 2018 Visualization Night, Uber Principal Designer Erik Klimczak discusses how the Uber Data Design team leverages data throughout the organization to build better products.'
