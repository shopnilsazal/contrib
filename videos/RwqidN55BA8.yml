title: 'PyCon UK 2014: Repeatable automated deployments with Juju'
language: English
recordingDate: 1413830103
description: "Presented by: Michael Foord & Simon Davy\n\nDo you deploy your Python services to Amazon EC2, or to Openstack, or even to HP cloud, joyent or Azure? Do you want to - without being tied into any one of them?\n\nWhat about local deployments with lxc or kvm containers. How about managing your bare metal servers through Metal As A Service and deploying to OpenStack on top? ISP grade technology for your data centre!\n\nHow about managing your service deployment and infrastructure with Python code? (Devops distilled.)\n\nIf any of this sounds interesting then Juju maybe for you! Treat your servers as cattle not as pets, for service oriented repeatable deployments on your choice of back-end. Orchestrate and relate your services with charms written in Python.\n\nIn this talk we'll demo service deployment for a Django application and related infrastructure."
