title: 'Oliver Nagy - A Game Engine For Engineers'
recordingDate: 1430054446
description: "PyData Dallas 2015\n\"Azrael is a game engine for engineers. Unlike traditional engines it emphasises accurate physics, runs in the Cloud, and offers a language agnostic API. Its main purpose is to make it easy for engineers to build, study, and control complex physical systems, for instance how to auto pilot a space ship; or a fleet thereof; in formation; through an Asteroid belt... I will show a live demo to illustrate the concept. It uses a simple control algorithm to manoeuvre an object to a pre defined position in space. Once there it will maintain that position despite random collisions with other objects.\""
