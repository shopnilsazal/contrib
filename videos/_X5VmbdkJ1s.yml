description: 'The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program uniquely identifies and names publicly-disclosed vulnerabilities in software and other codebases. Whether you are a vulnerability researcher, a vendor, or a project maintainer, it has never been easier to have CVE IDs assigned to vulnerabilities you are disclosing or coordinating around. This presentation will be an opportunity to find out how to participate as well as a chance to offer your thoughts, questions, or feedback about CVE. Attendees will learn what is considered a vulnerability for CVE, how to assign CVE IDs to vulnerabilities, how to describe those vulnerabilities within CVE ID entries, how to submit those assignments, and where to get more information about CVE assignment.'
