description: "Founded in 2002, Seattle.rb is the first and oldest ruby group in the world. We've evolved a lot over the years and have found a balance that I think works very well for many, if not most, groups. Seattle.rb has also had a study group off-and-on for a few years. We've tackled doozies like SICP but also programmed games in Racket (scheme). I will share the recipe for our user group and study group as well as the trade-offs we've made over the years and what they meant to us.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2N/"
