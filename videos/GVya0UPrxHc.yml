title: 'Hungry Academy Panel'
recordingDate: 1345448764
description: 'Over the past five months, a small group of enthusiastic, dedicated, and adventurous students have participated in an intense program designed to produce top-notch developers attuned to delivering compelling software products. LivingSocial decided to create this program, which they named Hungry Academy, to address a gap they have encountered while building one of the best software teams in the industry. LivingSocial, along with partner JumpstartLab, built a unique approach to the emergent phenomenon of alternative education in software development and provided it to students of varied background and experience. This panel discussion will include several graduates from Hungry Academy as well as co-instructor Matt Yoho. They will discuss the program, their experiences, and what they learned.'
