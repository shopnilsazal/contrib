Animal Crossing: New Leaf uses network communication to build upon the first Nintendo 64 game's mission of \"encouraging communication among different players.\" In this 2014 talk, Producer Katsuya Eguchi and Director Aya Kyogoku, discuss the different approaches they tried to develop ideas that would take advantage of the environment surrounding players so that the franchise would always provide both old and new consumers with something fresh and appealing.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
