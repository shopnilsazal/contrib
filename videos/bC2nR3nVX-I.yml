description: "Donna Benjamin\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/65/view_talk\nThe user story sits at the centre of most agile development methodologies. \r\n\r\nBut what makes a good story? and where do stories come from? What do we do with them once they've been estimated, prioritised, re-sized and broken down? How can we maintain our sense of the big picture when it's broken down into tiny puzzle pieces? How does that help us build good products?\r\n\r\nThis talk puts the focus on the \"user\" telling the story to understand their requirements for the product. It then turns back to the team to look at how we hear and discuss those stories in order to bring them to life to build the product, and build it right."
