When it comes to talking about free software legal tools, we need tocontrol the message. If we let other entities fill in the gaps in our outreachstrategy, a lot of context and nuance will be lost. A poor or incompletemessage hinders our ability to gain more widespread acceptance of freesoftware tools and practices.\n\nSuing collaborators or consciously working to erode well-established communitynorms for short term gain has no place in the world the free softwarecommunity is trying to build. Massive, globally useful, customizable softwareprojects aren't merely a side effect of publicly available repositories,they're a product of intentionally cooperative communities with rules andlegal safeguards. The FOSS community's message must be, \"If you don't respectour legal tools, then you aren't a free or open source software company.\"\n\nPolicy isn't made by coders. Official government policy is made by judges andlegislators and company policy is made by engaging with business and legalteams. We need to foster better understanding of our tools and norms amongstpolicy makers. This talk will offer ideas on how we should craft and deliverour message around the adoption of free software legal tools.\n\n\nRoom: H.1301 (Cornil)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 15:00:00"
