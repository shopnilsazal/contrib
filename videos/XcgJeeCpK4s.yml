description: "RailsConf 2018: Lessons in Ethical Development I Learned From Star Wars by Jameson Hampton\n\nStar Wars fans may have been excited about 2016â€™s release of Rogue One because of the courageous new rebel characters it introduced, but it also provided a lot more insight into the Empire's Corp of Engineers and how they ended up building the Death Star. As developers, we have a responsibility to think about the ethical implications of our work and how it might be used. This session will discuss ways of deciding for yourself what kinds of projects you are or aren't comfortable working and tips for self-accountability in your career - through the lens of characters we know and love from Star Wars."
