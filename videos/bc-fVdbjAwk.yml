You just have to see it. :)\n\nYou people have been asking for a new pair programming session for a long time, and I have been wanting to do one for some time. \n\nThe  atrocious code that we wrote during the episode:\nhttps://gist.github.com/mpj/94427edd9a5ed4d2cc677f1ae0a0558b\n\nIrina Shestak on the Interwebs:\nhttps://github.com/lrlna (you can find better Automata examples here)\nhttps://twitter.com/_lrlna\n\nLevel up your cellular automata knowledge!\n\n1. Level 1: Complexity: A guided tour, Melanie Mitchell\nhttp://amzn.to/2c1AV6F\n\n2. Level 2: I know it's just a wikipedia page, but I find this one useful && informative!\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton\n\n3. Level 3: Model Thinking: Cellular Automata, Scott E. Page\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBB_lOfsqQA\n\n4. Level 4: This page describes how each rule put together by Wolfram ends up working: http://atlas.wolfram.com/01/01/\n\n5. Level 5: This one is a paper, but is still quite accessible; \"Computational mechanics of cellular automata: An example\", by James E. Hansom and James P. Crutchfield. \n\nConferences mentioned:\nhttp://nordicjs.com\nhttps://braziljs.org\n\nI'm also active on:\nâ€¢ Twitter https://twitter.com/mpjme\nâ€¢ Medium https://medium.com/@mpjme\nâ€¢ Quora https://www.quora.com/profile/Mattias-Petter-Johansson\n\nDavid's (the guy from last pair programming video, and whose office that we used) channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0TQC6ZPNm23dU6ecc5x0Gg"
