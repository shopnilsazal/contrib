description: 'During Uber Engineering’s first Machine Learning Meetup on September 12, 2017, Principal Engineer Waleed Kadous discusses how machine learning extracts raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge about the physical world to improve user experiences on the Uber platform. Examples of Uber Maps’ machine learning applications include destination prediction (predicting which destination a user will choose based on previous trips) and computer vision for map optical character recognition.'
