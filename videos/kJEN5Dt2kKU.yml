description: "Running a Business, Demystified by Todd Kaufman\n\nBuilding a business is both mysterious and hard. We can't do much to make it easier, but after 6 years running Test Double, we can make it less mysterious. This talk is a slow-motion Q & A: submit a question to http://testdouble.com/business and we'll build a slide deck that gives as many practical (and colorful) answers we can fit in a 45 minute session.\n\nThis talk is for anyone whose interest in starting a software company has ever been held back by fear, uncertainty or doubt. It assumes no knowledge of business jargon and will strive to explain each financial concept covered."
