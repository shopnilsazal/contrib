description: "CNI, CRI, and OCI - Oh My! [I] - Elsie Phillips & Paul Burt, CoreOS\n\nIf you work with containers, it’s easy to get lost in the emerging standards and foundations. You might have questions like:\nWhat is OCI? What happened to appc? Do I need to do anything to take advantage? Don’t we already have container runtimes? So, why do we need CRI? Similarly, what’s the use of CNI with all of the container networking solutions already out there?\n\nOur aim is to answer all of these questions, and showcase places you can find (and use!) each of them. We’ll discuss how these specs affect you when using Kubernetes or other container orchestrated projects. Kubernetes will serve as a handy vehicle for some short, live demos. We’ll explore how each standard is improving our lives today, and what kinds of innovation they open up for the future.\n\nAbout Paul Burt\nPaul Burt is a Community Manager at CoreOS. He’s upvoting your /r/kubernetes threads and answering your #coreos questions on freeNode. Paul has a knack for and demystifying infrastructure, and making gnarly, complex topics approachable. He enjoys home brewing beer, reading independent comics, and yelling at his computer when it doesn’t do what he wants.\n\nAbout Elsie Phillips\nElsie herds the CoreOS Community and Co-Leads the Kubernetes Contributor Experience SIG. She's a northwest native who got her start in open source working at the Oregon State University Open Source Lab. In her free time she throws wild one woman dance parties and makes a mean vegan chocolate chip cookie."
