title: 'Netflix JavaScript Talks - Async JavaScript with Reactive Extensions'
recordingDate: 1404433255
description: "Jafar Husain shares how Netflix uses the Reactive Extensions (Rx) library to build responsive user experiences that strive to be event-driven, scalable and resilient. Learn the power of the Observable and how Netflix has simplified code through the ability to filter, aggregate, compose and project data streams.\n\nThis talk discusses how Netflix uses Rx to:\n- Declaratively build complex events out of simple events (ex. drag and drop)\n- Coordinate and sequence multiple Ajax requests\n- Reactively update the UI in response to data changes\n- Eliminate memory leaks caused by neglecting to unsubscribe from events\n- Gracefully propagate and handle asynchronous exceptions\n\nSlides: http://www.slideboom.com/presentations/1002549/Async-Javascript-at-Netflix-2014-03-19?pk=58d9-8985-be37-25f7-dc90-fe60-a9e2-03ab\n"
