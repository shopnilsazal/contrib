title: 'One Size Does Not Fit All in DB Systems'

description: "\"One Size Does Not Fit All in DB Systems\", by Andy Palmer, Global Head of Software and Data Engineering, Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this video are those of the speaker(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the USENIX Association.**\r\n\r\nThe past 25 years of commercial DBMS development can be summed up in a single phrase: \"One size fits all.\" The traditional DBMS architecture (originally designed and optimized for business data processing) has been used to support many data-centric applications, with widely varying characteristics and requirements. The commercial database market is beginning to transform into a number of segments—most notably, OLTP vs. data warehousing—each of which is defined by a specific workload. Innovative \"purpose-built\" independent database engines are now being widely adopted to satisfy specific workloads. Picking the right engine for a given workload is a new challenge, and doing this well can offer discontinuous benefits in terms of performance, scale, maintainability, and concurrency."
