description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nThe Path to GPU as a Service in Kubernetes - Renaud Gaubert, NVIDIA (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nTLDR: Kubernetes modern production patterns for Deep Learning applications and a deep dive into the Kubernetes GPU and Hardware accelerators subsystem and itâ€™s challenges (performance, scheduling, monitoring). Autonomous vehicles, face recognition, High Performance Computing, Virtual Reality, NVIDIA GPUs are enabling a new computer era with cloud computing at its center. With kubernetes being the next iteration in cloud technologies, the NVIDIA container team is driving with the community the advances in GPU integration. During this talk we will take a look at the possibilities and limitations provided by the kubernetes infrastructure for hardware accelerators. We will also be discussing the latest improvements in the device plugin subsystem of Kubernetes, powering GPU support, and the challenges ahead of it.\n\nAbout Renaud\nRenaud Gaubert has been working for a year at NVIDIA on making GPU applications easier to deploy and manage in data centers. He focuses on supporting GPU-accelerated machine learning frameworks in container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes and Docker swarm. He is an active member of the Kubernetes Resource Management workgroup and helps pushing forward GPU integration in the Container ecosystem. He holds an M.S. in computer science from the French engineering school EPITA."
