description: "Building Serverless Application Pipelines [A] - Sebastien Goasguen, Bitnami\n\nThe serverless paradigm is bringing a new type of applications to the forefront of application architecture. Distributed, containerized, scalable, event-driven and ephemeral with fine grained billing. In this talk we will go through several application use-cases that are driving the serverless movement (e.g data processing, IoT, mobile-backends,machine learning) and demonstrate how these applications can be developed and deployed on top of Kubernetes using an open source serverless solution called kubeless. Through live demos and examples, we will show that Kubernetes with its rich and stable core API is the perfect platform to build FaaS solutions.\n\nAbout Sebastien Goasguen\nSebastien Goasguen is a twenty year open source veteran. A member of the Apache Software Foundation, he worked on Apache CloudStack and Libcloud for several years before diving into the container world. He is the founder of Skippbox, a Kubernetes startup acquired by Bitnami where he currently serves as Senior Director of Cloud Technologies. An avid blogger he enjoys spreading the word about new cutting edge technologies . Sebastien is the author of the Oâ€™Reilly Docker Cookbook and the Kubernetes Cookbook."
