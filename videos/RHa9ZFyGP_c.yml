description: "Vulnerabilities in smart contracts have resulted in the loss of 100s of million USD and have put near 1 billion USD in cryptocurrency at risk. Despite the enormous amount of funds entrusted to these contracts, our community is still in the infancy of understanding secure smart contract design.\n\nThis example-driven talk will deconstruct real-world smart contract vulnerabilities, reverse engineer in-the-wild exploitation tactics and discuss defensive coding practices that will help developers avoid pitfalls in the future. The talk will close with a survey of the current state of the art in autonomous and manual-assist smart contract auditing tools.\n\nThis talk is presented by the team behind PolySwarm (https://polyswarm.io) – the first decentralized threat intelligence market where security researchers are rewarded for their ability to identify malware.\n\n=== \n\nBen brings over a decade of experience in information security to the table, having led research on automated program analysis, malware reverse engineering, secure software development, cryptography, cryptocurrency, and vulnerability analysis.\n\nHaving won multiple CTFs, including DEF CON, Ben continues to participate in hacking competitions today, staying at the cutting edge of reverse engineering and software exploitation. At Narf, he made use of this experience in his work on DARPA’s Cyber Grand Challenge, helping to develop and secure a game with millions in prizes that tested the state-of-the-art in program analysis.\n\nIt’s not all fun and games though: throughout his career, Ben has uncovered hundreds of vulnerabilities in an impressive range of products, including widely-used open source products, hugely popular web applications, security-critical embedded devices, and multiple mobile platforms. He authored many source and binary analysis tools to aid in his research, ensuring that future bugs can be found quickly and efficiently.\n\nBen holds a BSc and MSc in Computer Science from the University of Tulsa."
