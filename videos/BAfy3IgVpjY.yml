description: "The ruby standard library is full of great code. It's also full of dragons. I'll show you some of fun parts, parts that you may not be using and may not even know about. I'll show you that you don't have to install everything on GitHub to build your application. I'll also look at some of nasty parts, and how to put a training collar on some of those dragons.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGbO/"
