description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nPrometheus Monitoring Mixins: Using Jsonnet to Package Together Dashboards, Alerts and Exporters - Tom Wilkie, Kausal (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nPrometheus offers powerful open source monitoring and alerting - but that comes with higher degrees of freedom, making pre-configure monitoring configuration hard to build. Simultaneously, its becoming accepted wisdom that the developers of a given software package are best placed to operate said software, or at least construct the basic monitoring configuration. In this talk we present a technique for using Jsonnet (a configuration language from Google) for packaging and deploying “Monitoring Mixins” - extensible and customisable combinations of dashboards, alert definitions and exporters. This technique allows developers of open source projects to publish best-practice monitoring configurations alongside their code, and for users to consume it, customise it and stay up to date. We will present example Mixins for Kubernetes and other services such as Consul and Cassandra.\n\nPrometheus offers powerful open source monitoring and alerting - but that comes with higher degrees of freedom, making pre-configure monitoring configuration hard to build.
