description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\nThursday, September 18 â€¢ 9:30am - 10:15am\n\nIEEE Computer Society's Center for Secure Design - Helping You Design More Secure Software\n\nThe IEEE Computer Society's CSD (Center for Secure Design) was formed in 2014 with the goal of identifying common design flaws and creating tools or design patterns so architects and developers can avoid introducing those design flaws into software.\n\nThe CSD aims to create artifacts to aid in the analysis of software design and additional artifacts to aid in designing software for security. This presentation will outline the results of the first workshop convened in May of this year where the Top N design flaws were documented, and also discuss some of the goals of future IEEE CSD workshops.\n\n\nSpeaker\n\nJim DelGrosso\nPrincipal Consultant, Cigital\nJim is a Principal Consultant at Cigital with over 30 years of experience working for software development and consulting organizations. At Cigital, Jim heads up the Architecture Analysis practice with the mission to analyze the architecture and design of systems to identify flaws and provide our customers contextual guidance to remediate or mitigate those flaws.\n\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
