title: 'Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Load Testing With A Vengeance by Dan Yoder and Carlo Flores'
recordingDate: 1334855915
description: "We've all seen load tests of a single \"hello world\" HTTP server using tools like ab or httperf. But what about load testing for real world Web applications and testing architectures that go beyond a few processes on a single machine? What about testing elastic \"on-demand\" architectures that add capacity as load grows? How does testing in the cloud affect your results? At what point does bandwidth become a bottleneck instead of CPU or memory? And what are we really measuring? What is the difference between connections and request per second? And how do those ultimately relate to infrastructure cost, which is the real bottom line?\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGko/"
