description: "Closing Keynote: Safe Systems Software and the Future of Computing by Joe Duffy\n\nSomeday in the future, all important systems software on the planet will be written in a safe programming language. The questions are, when, and how do we get there?\n\nIn this talk, I will describe my experiences at Microsoft building a new operating system written entirely in a Rust-like safe systems language. I will also talk about my subsequent efforts taking those experiences and applying them to the heart of Windows, and the associated technical and cultural challenges."
