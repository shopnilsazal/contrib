title: 'GeeCON Prague 2017: Mark West - Building a Smart Security Camera with Raspberry Pi Zero/Java/AWS'
recordingDate: 1516816493
description: 'In this session, I’ll share how I transformed a lowly Raspberry Pi Zero W webcam into a smart security camera (with motion detection, threat analysis and alert notifications) by combining open source software with cloud based image analysis. Attendees can expect a short explanation of how to set up their own motion activated webcam and a demonstration of how they can use Java and a range of AWS Services (including Rekognition, Lambda Functions and Step Functions) to help their camera distinguish between an unwanted guest and the neighbour’s cat. Finally we’ll compare Node.js and Java versions of this solution and compare them in terms of execution speed, operating cost and ease of development.'
