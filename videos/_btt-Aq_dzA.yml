description: "Martin Holst Swende, Patrik Karlsson - Web Application Analysis With Owasp Hatkit\n\n\nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-19/dc-19-presentations/Swende-Karlsson/DEFCON-19-Swende-Karlsson-Owasp-Hatkit.pdf \nThe presentation will take a deep dive into two newly released Owasp tools; the Owasp Hatkit Proxy and the Owasp Hatkit Datafiddler. The name Hatkit is an acronym (of sorts) for Http Analysis Toolkit and are tools mainly for people who analyse (hack!) web applications. The tools make extensive use of MongoDB, in particular the advanced querying facilities in available in this database. Prior knowledge of Javascript and Python is an advantage, but absolutely no requirement.\n\nMartin Holst Swende is a Senior Security Consultant at 2Secure AB, working with application security- and penetration testing. Martin has a background as a Java/J2me-programmer but nowadays finds more joy in Python and Javascript. Martin is project leader for the Owasp Hatkit Proxy/Datafiddler projects and contributor to open source security projects such as Webscarab and Nmap.\nTwitter: @mhswende\n\nPatrik Karlsson is a Senior Security Expert with over ten years of experience in the field of IT- and Information Security.
