description: "by Llu√≠s Esquerda\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nMany years ago I built a FOSS Android application for our local bike sharingsystem. After realizing global bike sharing information was not publiclyavailable we ended up going after the task of solving the problem for once andfor all: a free and open API for others to create applications, visualizationsand research on bike sharing data. Fast forward today and thanks to thecommunity, the CityBikes project supports more than 400 cities all around theworld and our API powers most bike sharing transportation apps on allplatforms.\n\nThe CityBikes project is a good example of the benefits on the so-called \"opendata\". When data is made available, the community is eager to contribute toand improve public services. We are usually regarded as an \"open dataproject\", even though less than 10% of our data feeds come from properlylicensed, documented and machine readable feeds. Our project showcases theneed of a better policy than the PSI Directive [2] regarding re-use of publicsector information, and some common misconceptions between representation anddata.\n\nThe main problem with the PSI Directive is that it does not take into accountPublic-Private partnerships (PPP). If data ownership or re-use is left out ofthe deal, the company kidnaps the data and leaves both the city council andits citizens at the mercy of the company providing the service. That is, onlythe company (or any other company in agreement with the \"umbrella company\") isto provide applications to use their systems. We as citizens should demandthat any project that comes as a result of a public-private partnership shouldput the data right where it belongs: the public.\n\nWhen I started this project on the year 2010 little did I know I would end upbattling city councils and companies to release their data as public feeds,nor I could imagine pybikes [3] was going to help create apps for allplatforms [4] without having to code a single line.\n\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:40:00"
