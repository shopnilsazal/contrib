description: "Description\nThe aim of this talk is to present the peculiarities as well as pros and cons of different types of activation functions used in Neural Networks. During this talk we will go through both theory and practice. Problems from different domains (image recognition, working with text) will be discussed.\n\nAbstract\nThe aim of this talk is to present the peculiarities as well as pros and cons of different types of activation functions used in Neural Networks. Activation Functions that we will cover:\n\nSigmoid\nTanh\nReLU\nSoftmax\nThe next part of the talk will focus on experimental results. We will present how the training/test errors behave when using different activation functions. We will focus on measures like:\n\nTime to reach certain accuracy\nOverall accuracy achieved\nTime for 1 epoch\nAt the end of the presentation we will do an overview of available deep learning frameworks to show which activation functions are implemented in those packages.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
