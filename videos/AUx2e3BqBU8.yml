description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nSource2Image Deep Dive – Ben Parees, Red Hat & Matt Moore, Google (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nThis session is dedicated to an in-depth understanding of building images on or for Kubernetes. We will present some best practices, give some short demos and discuss some improvements that can be made to help developers repeatably convert source code into compiled apps running on Kubernetes. In this session, we will discuss what building images means to us as a community, and where we should focus our efforts in future. We will explore current channels for collaboration like sig-apps and dev-tools-wg, as ways to evolve the community discussion on these topics.\n\nAbout Ben\nBen Parees is a Principal Engineer on OpenShift. He serves as the lead for the Developer Experience team which focuses on workflows that take developers from source code to PaaS deployed Docker image based applications, including continuous integration and delivery flows.\n\nAbout Matt\nMatthew co-founded and was the original Tech Lead for the Google Container Registry product, and has been involved with Docker at Google since the beginning. These days, Matthew is focused on Uber TLing container development and firmly believes that we can do better than Dockerfiles. He is the principal author of github.com/google/containerregistry and github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker which enable the construction and manipulation of Docker images without a Docker daemon or root. As a part of building better container images, Matthew believes we should kick the Distro out of our containers. Come see why at his talk!"
