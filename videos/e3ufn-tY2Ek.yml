This talk will describe how the Nearby API can be used in your app to detect other devices and communicate with them. Itâ€™ll provide an introduction to the Nearby APIs, and give an insight into best practices for adding proximity features to your app. The target audience are app developers who want to explore how communication with nearby devices can provide magical user experiences in their apps."
