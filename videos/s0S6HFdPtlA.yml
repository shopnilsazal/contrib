recordingDate: 1513886528
description: "PyData New York City 2017\n\nSlides: https://ericmjl.github.io/bayesian-deep-learning-demystified/\n\nIn this talk, I aim to do two things: demystify deep learning as essentially matrix multiplications with weights learned by gradient descent, and demystify Bayesian deep learning as placing priors on weights. I will then provide PyMC3 and Theano code to illustrate how to construct Bayesian deep nets and visualize uncertainty in their results."
