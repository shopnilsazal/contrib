title: 'ClojureBridge - Building a more diverse Clojure community - Ali King'
recordingDate: 1436277461
description: 'ClojureBridge was created to introduce women and other underrepresented groups to the Clojure language over a one day workshop, with the aim of increasing the diversity of Clojurian communities. This talk covers the practical steps required to organise a ClojureBridge event, based on the speaker''s experience of organising the first European ClojureBridge and supporting and mentoring other organisers. It also looks at how Clojure might fit into a learner''s programming education, and how to maximise the outcomes so that workshop attendees become active members of their local Clojure programming community. ClojureBridge events have so far been held in Edinburgh and London, with more planned for Solingen, Berlin, Bristol and Helsingborg.'
