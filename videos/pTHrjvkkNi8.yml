description: "In this episode of GoingNative, Steve Carroll talks to Brent Rector and Kenny Kerr from the Windows team about C++/WinRT!\n\nC++/WinRT is a standard C++ header-based library that takes WinRT APIs and exposes them as C++ classes that you can use in your application in a natural and familiar way. You can consume it from any standard C++ application and is the easiest way to get access to the modern Windows APIs. C++/WinRT is designed to offer an improved alternative to C++/CX and works with any major standard C++ compiler on Windows. It shipped inside the Windows 10 SDK v17025 for the first time. This means that as long as you have a version of the Windows 10 SDK installed that is at least 17025, you can simply include the appropriate headers from within any C++ project and start writing modern C++ code using the Windows API.\n\nYou can learn more about C++/WinRT here: https://moderncpp.com/\n\nYou can also check out the CppCon 2017 talk: C++/WinRT and the future of C++ on Windows"
