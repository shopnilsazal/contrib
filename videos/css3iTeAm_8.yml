recordingDate: 1383367640
description: "WE OWE IT ALL TO THE HACKERS\n\nThe same spirit that drives the modern hackers today was the impetus to move digital technology into the mainstream of our lives. Learning about the creativeness and chutzpah of the early hackers--and understanding their implicit advocacy of openness and freedom--puts the tech landscape of today into perspective.\n\n\nSteven Levy is the senior writer for Wired Magazine and the author of seven books, including Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, the classic computer history book. He was formerly the chief technology correspondent for Newsweek. Other books include Crypto, Artificial Life and Insanely Great (the history of the Macintosh computer). His most recent book, In the Plex, is the result of a three year immersion into Google. In its review of the book, the Washington Post called Levy \"American's premier technology journalist.\""
