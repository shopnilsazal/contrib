title: 'Graal How to use the new JVM JIT compiler in real life (C. Thalinger)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1525249332
description: 'With JEP 317: Experimental Java-Based JIT Compiler it is very likely that Graal will be part of JDK 10. In fact, Graal is already available in JDK 9 due to JEP 243: Java-Level JVM Compiler Interface. Graal is itself written in Java and that brings some new properties and behavior to the table which we haven''t seen with existing HotSpot JIT compilers. This talk will show how to use Graal with JDK 9, how to compile an upstream Graal version and what to look out for when using it for benchmarking or even in production.'
