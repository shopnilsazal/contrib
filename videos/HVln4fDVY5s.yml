description: "Angus Blitter - Fear and Loathing in Cyberspace: The art and science of enemy profiling\nQuickly identifying your opponent, in any conflict, can mean the difference between success and failure. Knowing their capabilities, resources and limitations can provide the tactical advantage. The lack of this type of decision support is a serious deficiency in most information warrior's arsenals. Relying on single source intelligence is pure folly. Charlatans and carpetbaggers are salivating at the millions in government and corporate dollars earmarked for such a competitive advantage. Our discussion will provide a working definition for \"profiling\", how it is used and why it effects everyone!\n\nAngus Blitter is the founder and Grand Poopa of HSK. \nDEF CON 7.0 was held July 9-11th, 1999, in Las Vegas Nevada USA"
