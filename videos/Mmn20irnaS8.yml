description: "RailsConf 2017: Syntax Isn't Everything: NLP for Rubyists by Aja Hammerly\n\nNatural Language Processing is an interesting field of computing. The way humans use language is nuanced and deeply context sensitive. For example, the word work can be both a noun and a verb. This talk will give an introduction to the field of NLP using Ruby. There will be demonstrations of how computers fail and succeed at human language. You'll leave the presentation with an understanding of both the challenges and the possibilities of NLP and some tools for getting started with it."
