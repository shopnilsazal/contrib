description: "by Stephan DÃ¼hr\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nBareos (Backup Archiving Recovery Open Sourced) is a reliable, cross-networkopen source software for backup, archiving and recovery of data for all well-established operating systems. Emerged from the Bacula Project in 2010, Bareoswas and is actively developed as a fork and enriched with lots of newfeatures. After a short introduction about the Bareos architecture andterminology, this session will introduce how to extend Bareos with Pluginswritten in Python.\n\nUsing plugins makes it possible to extend the Bareos functionality. Thisallows to backup and restore in an application specific and more flexible anddynamic way than normal file backup. Use cases include database backups,agentless virtual machine backups or LDAP backups. Using Python makes this alot easier, and with its large library for connectivity and API access it ispossible to address a wide range of applications.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 15:15:00"
