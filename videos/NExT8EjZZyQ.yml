description: "Deviant Ollam & Panel: Boomstick Fu: The Fundamentals of Physical Security at its Most Basic Level\nIt seems that at every con nowadays there is at least one talk dedicated \nto physical security. Our servers and data can be encrypted and \npassworded with the latest algorithms, but that doesn't do the trick if \nsomeone marches them out the door when we're not looking. In the past, \nmany physical security talks have focused on passive defense: locks that \nresist picking, safes which resist cracking, etc. However, sometimes an \nintrusion is detected while in progress... and such intrusions ? even \nphysical ones ? may require immediate countermeasures.\n\nMany of us in the security community own firearms, but few have ever had \nto use them in a defensive situation. Others have considered gun \nownership but lack any experience or foundation in this area. This \npanel of experts will provide a comprehensive overview of this \nhighly-charged and often-misunderstood topic. Bring any questions you \nhave about hardware, ammunition, tactics, and the law.\n\"Deviant Ollam is a frequent speaker on the topic of physical security. A \ngraduate of the New Jersey Institute of Technology's \"Science, \nTechnology, & Society\" program, he is always fascinated by the interplay \nthat connects human values and social trends to developments in the \ntechnical world. A gun-owning peacenick, Deviant disdains violence but \nbelieves in being prepared to confront it. He has given physical \nsecurity presentations at DefCon, ShmooCon, HOPE, and at various \ncolleges and universities, including the United States Military Academy \nat West Point.\n\nNoid is a recognized member of both the hacking world and the firearm \ncommunity. A shooting enthusiast who has handled just about every \nmanufactured style of firearm, his encyclopedic knowledge of guns \nresults in a constant barrage of questions from individuals who are \nconsidering the purchase of a new piece of steel. During particularly \nstressful days at the office, Noid considers hanging up his INFOSEC \nspurs and becoming a range master or armorer for the Feds.\n\nFrank Thornton (a.k.a. Thorn) runs his own consulting firm, Blackthorn \nSystems, which specializes in wireless networks. In addition to his \ncomputer interests, Frank was a law enforcement officer for many years. \nHe has investigated thousands of crimes, been in numerous armed \nconfrontations, and been directly involved in several shootings. \nCombining both professional interests, he was a member of the workgroup \nthat established ANSI Standard \"ANSI/NIST-CSL 1-1993 Data Format for the \nInterchange of Fingerprint Information.\""
