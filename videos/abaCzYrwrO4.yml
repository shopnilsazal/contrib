description: 'Get the latest information about how the law is racing to catch up with technological change from staffers at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the nationâ€™s premiere digital civil liberties group fighting for freedom and privacy in the computer age. This session will include updates on current EFF issues such as surveillance online, encryption (and backdoors), and fighting efforts to use intellectual property claims to shut down free speech and halt innovation, discussion of our technology project to protect privacy and speech online, updates on cases and legislation affecting security research, and much more. Half the session will be given over to question-and-answer, so it''s your chance to ask EFF questions about the law and technology issues that are important to you.'
