description: "Being a Rails developer is more than just understanding how to use the Framework to develop applications.\n\nTo become an efficient developer, you should learn how the Framework works; how deep this understanding should be is up to you. Exploring the Framework code is something that everyone should do at least once.\n\nNot only may you learn how it works but also, you might learn new tricks from the code itself or discover small features that are not widely publicized."
