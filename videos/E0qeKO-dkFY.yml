description: "Migrating Configuration to Kubernetes with Container-Transform - Micah Hausler, Skuid\n\n\"Kubernetes has accelerated application development time for many organizations but one of the most tedious aspects of moving from application prototypes to running pods on Kubernetes is the repetitive task writing pod configuration files. A common workflow for many teams is to write development configurations in docker-compose before running a pod in Kubernetes. After using various container clustering systems, Micah recognized the need to be able to quickly interchange between formats. In late 2014 Micah open-sourced container-transform for interchanging docker-compose and Amazon's EC2 Container Service tasks, and has since added several other application formats including Marathon, Chronos, and more recently Kubernetes! In this talk Micah will demonstrate how developers can convert an app from docker-compose to Kubernetes, or even migrate from another clustering systems to Kubernetes. https://github.com/micahhausler/container-transform\n\nAbout Micah Hausler\nMicah Hausler is a SRE at Skuid and enjoys building tools in addition to operating sites. Originally from Michigan, Micah has lived the last 9 years in Chattanooga, TN and loves kayaking, climbing, and biking in the area."
