description: "Verify your software for security bugs - Simon Roses Femerling\n\nVerification is an important phase of developing secure software that is not always addressed in depth that includes dynamic analysis and fuzzing testing. This step allows checking that security has been built in the implementation phase: secure coding and using compilers mitigations correctly. \n\nThis presentation will cover the current state of verification technologies that developers can use to check the lack of security mitigations (ASLR, DEP, SafeSEH, Stack Guard, PIE, etc.) and vulnerabilities (Missing Code Signing, Insecure API, DLL planting, poor coding, etc.) and how to implement a battery of tests in their organization to verify their products are safe before releasing as required by an Application Assurance process. \n\nA new tool will be presented, BinSecSweeper, that performs security binary analysis, is open source and cross platform (Windows and Linux) and can scan PE & ELF file formats for x86-64 that can be used by developers to check their software includes security mitigations and is compliance with Application Assurance best practices or by IT pros to identify insecure applications in their networks. This technology was sponsored by DARPA Cyber Fast Track (CFT). \nIf you develop software or work in AppSec this is your talk!\n\n\nSpeaker\n\nSimon Roses Femerling\n\nSimon Roses holds a B.S. from Suffolk University (Boston), Postgraduate in E-Commerce from Harvard University (Boston) and Executive MBA from IE Business School (IE, Madrid). Frequent speaker at security industry events including BLACK HAT, RSA, OWASP, SOURCE. DeepSec and Microsoft Security Technets.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
