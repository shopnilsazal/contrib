description: "From USENIX Security '12\n\nSpeaker: Dickie George, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory\n\nThis talk will discuss the change in assurance from the cold war of the '60s and '70s to today. The change in communications, the type of information targeted, and the emergence of new classes of adversaries force a huge change in assurance strategy. Mr. George will discuss the government's threat/adversary model and the assurance models of the last century and this century, and will include some real-life stories that highlight the threat and response."
