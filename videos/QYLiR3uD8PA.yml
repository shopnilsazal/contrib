description: "When Molehill Vulnerabilities Become Mountainous Exploits\n\nHere’s a story: you have built the ultimate AppSec program for your organization, and you complete the vital step of scanning your code for vulnerabilities along the development process. Your policy was very clear and strict about high priority vulnerabilities while lower vulnerabilities are addressed when time permits. Having achieved a significant coverage, you’re left with only three medium-severity vulnerabilities. You are about to sign off on the release; what could go wrong?\n\nWatch as a downloaded app is attacked through a live demo, and learn the real dangers of three of the most commonly found (and ignored) medium level vulnerabilities.\n\nJoin this session to\n\n• Watch how, when leveraged properly, medium level vulnerabilities become serious attacks\n\n• Understand why static source code analysis is vital to locate vulnerabilities that your pen tests are likely to miss\n\n• Learn how to use static application security testing as an attack technique\n\n\nMatt Rose\nGlobal Director Application Security Strategy, Checkmarx\nMatt has over 18 years of software development, sales engineering management and consulting experience. During this time, Matt has helped some of the largest organizations in the world in a variety of industries, regions, and technical environments implement secure software development life cycles utilizing static analysis.Matt’s extensive background in application security, object-oriented programming, multi-tier architecture design/implementation, and internet/intranet development has been key to many speaking engagements for organizations like OWASP, ISSA, and ISACA.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
