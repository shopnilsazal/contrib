description: "View slide presentation here:\nhttps://github.com/stephenpiment/object-store/blob/master/PyData_NYC_2014.ipynb\n\nPyData NYC 2014\nApplications often have back-end data stores that developers need to query. In this situation, you may first think of SQL, whether using a lightweight tool like SQLite or a full-fledged ORM like SQLAlchemy. However, for many data storage tasks, SQL is more than we really need. This talk presents an alternative approach that directly employs some of Pythonâ€™s most powerful language features. Using a distributed key-value store, we can make our data persistent with an interface similar to a Python dictionary. Python then gives us a number of tools \"out of the box\" that we can use to form queries: * generators for memory-efficient data retrieval; * itertools to filter and group data; * comprehensions to assemble the query results. Taken together, these features give us a really powerful query capability, and most of it is straight Python. By the end of this talk, you'll have an understanding of some sophisticated but accessible Python features that are immediately useful for manipulating data."
