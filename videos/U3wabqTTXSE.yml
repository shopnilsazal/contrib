description: "iGoat – A Self Learning Tool for iOS App Pentesting and Security\n\n\nOWASP iGoat is an open source self-learning tool for iOS developers, mobile app pentesters. The best thing about iGoat is that it follows client-server architecture and supports all iDevices including iPad, iPhone, iPod and Macbook simulator for iOS 8/9/10. It was inspired by the WebGoat project, and has a similar conceptual flow to it.\n\nAs such, iGoat is a safe environment where iOS developers can learn about the major security pitfalls they face as well as how to avoid them. It is made up of a series of lessons that each teach a single (but vital) security lesson.\n\nThe lessons are laid out in the following steps:\n\nBrief introduction to the problem.\n\nVerify the problem by exploiting it.\n\nBrief description of available remediations to the problem.\n\nFix the problem by correcting and rebuilding the iGoat program.\n\nThis talk is all about how iOS developers, security analysts can dive deep into iOS App Security using iGoat tool. This talk will start from setting up iGoat to exploiting latest exploits in iOS app. I’ll also release a new version of iGoat with tons of new exercises at Appsecusa 2017.\n\n\nSwaroop Yermalkar\n\nSenior Security Engineer, Philips\nSwaroop Yermalkar works as a Senior Security Engineer at Philips.
