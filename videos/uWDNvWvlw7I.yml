description: "Fabrizio Romano - TDD is not about tests!\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nTDD is not about tests!\nWell, actually, it’s not a about writing tests, or writing them before\nthe code. This talk will show you how to use tests to really drive\ndevelopment by transforming business requirements into tests, and\nallowing your code to come as their natural consequence.\n\nToo often this key aspect is neglected and the result is that tests\nand code are somehow “disconnected”. The code is not as short and\nefficient as it could be, and the tests are not as effective.\nRefactoring is not always easy, and over time all sorts of issues\nstart to come out of the surface.\n\nHowever, we will show that when TDD is done properly, tests and code\nmerge beautifully into an organic whole that fulfills the business\nrequirements, and provides all sorts of advantages: your code is\nminimal, easy to amend and extend, readable, clean. Your tests will be\neffective, short and focused, and allow for light-hearted refactoring\nand excellent coverage.\n\nWe will provide enough information and examples to spark the curiosity\nof the novice, and satisfy the need of a deeper insight for the\nintermediate, and help you immediately benefit from this\ntransformative technique that is still often underestimated and\nmisunderstood.\n\n\nSlides: [http://slides.com/gianchub/ep2015-tdd#/][1]\n\n[1]: http://slides.com/gianchub/ep2015-tdd#/"
