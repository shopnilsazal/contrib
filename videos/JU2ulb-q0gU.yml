title: 'DEF CON 18 - Paul Haas - Advanced Format String Attacks'
recordingDate: 1383782693
description: "Paul Haas - Advanced Format String Attacks\nFormat string attacks remain difficult in both software and hackademic exercises as the techniques have not improved since their discovery. This session demonstrates advanced format string attack techniques designed to automate the process from creation to compromise as well as incorporate those techniques into the Metasploit framework. The audience is encouraged to bring a basic understanding of format string attacks in order to leave the presentation with the tools necessary to never write one again.\n\nPaul Haas is the lead web application security engineer at Redspin, Inc, where has worked on a variety of research and penetration testing over the past four years with experience in over 100+ infrastructure and security assessment projects. He has a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of California Santa Barbara, and is a former member of the Reliable Software Group where he performed a variety of research into tracing the function calls of Linux binaries, cellular phone worms, the creation of an open source VMware framework for OWASP vulnerabilities, and ViSe, a virtual security testbed used to efficiently study computer attacks and suspect tools as part of a computer crime reconstruction. He is a former winner of the Defcon Capture the Flag contest and enjoys playing Mario Kart in his free time.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
