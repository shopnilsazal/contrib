A global network of volunteers are buildingsoftware that will put back control of communications back into people'shands. In many areas, such software exists but is not easy to use. FreedomBoxproject aims to build a consumer device that brings these decentralizedtechnologies together for easy usage and maintenance by typical users.\n\nRuben Lubbes has been working with and participating in the project for years,mainly working on translations, product development and persona's.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 14:30:00"
