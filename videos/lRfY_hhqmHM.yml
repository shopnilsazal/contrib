description: "\"Get your facts first, then you can distort them as you please\", or why I love continuous learning with continuous deployment. by: Steve Sanderson\n\nMost of us have worked where there's tremendous effort on planning, anticipating the needs of our customers, testing before release to our customers, re-thinking, re-considering and re-coding. To a developer, the only thing that may seem worse is when there's none of this. Regardless, we expect to know, in advance what's true about our customers.\n\nWhat if both alternatives are wrong? What if, instead, we assume we're ignorant and use our creativity to learn? Then, we'd\n\ncontinually run live experiments with our users to see what works; and\ngather more metrics than we know what to do with; and\ncontinually deploy changes to adapt those learnings.\nFind out why we worked this way, the results we achieved and the specific tools and technologies we use."
