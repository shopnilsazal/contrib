A talk at 34C3 last year showed how to gain root access to the underlying Ubuntu Linux operating system. Based on this groundwork, the talk will explain how the vacuum can be provisioned as a node in a Kubernetes cluster. From then on, well-known Kubernetes primitives can be used to control it: CronJobs periodically schedule drives, and a custom Prometheus exporter is used to track metrics about a vacuum’s life. Using custom controllers and CRDs, extended features of the vacuum can be utilised: requesting raw sensor readings, dumping a map of your home, and allowing the vacuum to drive custom paths.\n\nAbout Christian\nChristian can rely on his experiences from working as a Jack of all trades Linux sysadmin for 10+ years. This hands-on practices is backed by his academic work around security practices. Lately he’s focused on providing modern DevOps environments through the heavy use of containers. As soon as he is away from his laptop he enjoys beers and pork dishes (due to his Bavarian roots), visiting if not organising gigs or music festivals and keeping fit with swimming, hiking, skiing and lately playing field hockey.
