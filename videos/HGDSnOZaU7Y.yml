description: "(Chess timer talk)\nAbstract\nWhen last we spoke (CurryOn Prague, 2015), Pony had just been open sourced. Since then, we have developed a small but thriving community that mostly uses Pony for low-latency, high-throughput, concurrent server-side computing. Let’s talk about how Pony’s type system and runtime put actors to work to deliver a fast, predictable, GC’d, native-code, actor-model environment, including: data-race freedom, optimised binaries, the workstealing scheduler, fast zero-copy messaging, and efficient no-stop-the-world GC. And let’s talk about how industry users and academic researchers have been working together to improve Pony for \"real-world\" projects.\n\nBio\nSylvan Clebsch is the designer of the Pony programming language. After a career in embedded OSes, video games, and financial systems, he now works at Microsoft Research Cambridge in the Programming Language Principles group. He is interested in massively concurrent and distributed systems, garbage collection, type systems, actor-model programming, and trusted computing."
