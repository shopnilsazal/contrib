description: "PyData London 2018\n\nWe will present a case study of portfolio allocation on a Peer 2 Peer platform. Within the context of development of a heuristic optimization algorithm, we will focus on the bottlenecks of data manipulation in pandas, how to resolve them by using pure Numpy, compilation with Numba and embarrassingly parallel loops and explain how they work under the hood.\n\nSlides: https://www.dropbox.com/s/c1divrg1ku58a3j/Speeding%20up%20a%20large-scale%20algorithm%20--PyData18.pdf?dl=0\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
