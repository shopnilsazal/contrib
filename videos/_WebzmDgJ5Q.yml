description: "HD Moore & Valsmith: Tactical Exploitation\nPenetration testing often focuses on individual vulnerabilities and services. This talk introduces a tactical approach that does not rely on exploiting known vulnerabilities. Using combination of new tools and obscure techniques, I will walk through the process of compromising an organization without the use of normal exploit code. Many of the tools will be made available as new modules for the Metasploit Framework.\n\nHD Moore is the director of security research at BreakingPoint Systems, where he focuses on the security testing features of the BreakingPoint product line. HD is the founder of the Metasploit Project and one of the core developers of the Metasploit Framework, the leading open-source exploit development platform. In his spare time, HD searches for new vulnerabilities, develops security tools, and contributes to open-source security projects.\n\nValsmith has been involved in the computer security community and industry for over ten years. He currently works as a professional security researcher on problems for both the government and private sectors. He specializes in penetration testing (over 40,000 machines assessed), reverse engineering and malware research. He works on the Metasploit Project development team as well as other vulnerability development efforts. Most recently Valsmith founded Offensive Computing, a public, open source malware research project."
