description: 'Conversational Language Understanding: Recent advances in deep learning have all but solved speech recognition and image processing. The next frontier is natural language. Maluuba’s vision is intelligent machines that can think, reason, and communicate, and we believe that language and intelligence are inextricable. We’ll describe steps taken toward next-generation conversational systems. Such systems should include the capacity to retain memory across dialogue turns and from past conversations, to clarify user intents through dynamic, back-and-forth speech, and to acquire new knowledge through interaction with humans and they. By taking a deep-learning approach, we have achieved state-of-the-art performance in both question and answering as well as conversational language understanding.'
