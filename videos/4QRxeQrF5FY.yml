description: 'The lines of connectivity extend beyond the web browser and into almost every device we own. Mobile phones, sensors, and wearable tech are only as powerful as the platform that interconnects them. The Phoenix Framework is that platform and goes beyond the web by providing an abstract of connectivity through channels. Together, we''ll explore how to connect iOS, Mac OS, and Apple Watch to Phoenix using the ObjC channel adapter. To tie it all together, we''ll see how we can seamlessly start a motorcycle from an Apple Watch, stream ride stats using an iPhone, and display this data on a Mac OS App. Phoenix is defining a new web. Let''s find out what''s possible.'
