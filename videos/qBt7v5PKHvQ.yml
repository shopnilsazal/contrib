recordingDate: 1418924183
description: "Bugs and mess-ups are serious problems in software. Mistakes are inevitable - but the stakes can be high. If you're writing a hospital management system, they can cost lives. In a payments system, they can cost money. Since we can't eliminate bugs, this talk will cover strategies, hacks and monkey patches in Ruby to prevent bugs from leading to disaster. This isn't a traditional testing talk, but rather a thinking outside-of-the-box approach to busting bugs and building more robust software.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Fp8k/"
