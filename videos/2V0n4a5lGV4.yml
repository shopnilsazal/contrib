description: 'We often think of performance testing as one of those things we just have to do at the end of a project, often using heavyweight tool sets in dedicated environments. In this talk, James offers an alternative. What decisions would we make differently if we had the ability to rapidly perform experiments using lightweight performance testing as our lens? James will cover the pre-requisites to allow us to make small bets on performance and explore the strange world of evolutionary design that this technique makes possible.'
