description: "You might know that the lambda calculus is the theoretical foundation for all functional programming languages - but what is it really, and how does it work?\n\nIn this talk, we'll bring the theory to life! Using F# and the fparsec library, we will write a working lambda calculus interpreter from scratch. We'll even have time left to demonstrate how we can use it to do something useful, like adding numbers!"
