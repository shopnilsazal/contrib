recordingDate: 1384387615
description: "Hacking with GNURadio\nVideoman\n\nThis presentation I will focus on the requirements for GnuRadio, cost, code, and radio technology basics. I will also present some of attacks that have been created using the GnuRadio, as well as my own research from a successful hack of a proprietary Multiple Address System (MAS) SCADA network, and a quick demo of the GnuRadio in action.\n\nVideoman has 9+ years of experience doing computer security. He has worked for large enterprise financial institutions to secure their networks. Currently a computer security consultant, he enjoys working for NetSPI's clients to help them reduce their risks. In his spare time he and his wife run the local DefCon Group (DC612), and help to run the network at DefCon. He also likes to brew beer, and bike the many miles of pathways in Minnesota.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
