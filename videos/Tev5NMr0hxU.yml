description: "Panel: The Open Container Initiative (OCI) and the Future of Container Standardization [I] - Moderated by Chris Aniszczyk, Linux Foundation\n\nWith the proliferation and rapid growth of container-based solutions over the past few years-- including container-based solutions from almost all major IT vendors and cloud providers as well as emerging start-ups-- the industry needed a standard on which to support container formats and runtime. Enter the Open Container Initiative (OCI), established to help promote a set of common, minimal open standards and specifications around container formats and runtime. Setting a baseline de facto standard, OCI will soon release version 1.0 of its runtime and image format specifications, now ready to look at what’s next for the future of container standardization and distribution. Hear from OCI members who are experts in container technology as they discuss the project’s progress at large with special focus on what’s coming next after the v1.0 release and certification program launch. Additional discussion topics will include:\n\nHow the runtime and image format specs are driving broader innovation\nThe impact the v1.0 release will have on the container landscape\nImplementations and use cases \nValue and benefits of the certification program and what that means for container standards\nFuture plans for the OCI \n\nAbout Chris Aniszczyk\nChris Aniszczyk is an engineer by trade with a passion for open source and building communities.
