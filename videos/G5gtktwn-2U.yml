recordingDate: 1509352219
description: "Speakers : Alexandra Etienne (AR.js), Jerome Etienne (AR;js)\n\nWebAR is coming! And some will argue it's already here. Developing augmented reality on the web can sound very complex. We have developed a way to make it easy for anyone to do AR - and we want to share it with you! In this talk, we will take you through what WebAR is, what are its possibilities, and its challenges. We will also look at other efforts that exist, and share some demos made with AR.js, our open-source solution to do efficient augmented reality on the web."
