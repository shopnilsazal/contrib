description: "Andrea Goulet\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2016/netfringe/sfcxpf/\n\"The idea of a lone developer coding in their basement without social interaction is a thing of the past. These days, technical solutions are often developed by cross-functional teams whose participants have a range of technical experience. Now, more than ever, good communication skills are an essential part of being a software developer.\n\nIn this talk, Andrea Goulet, CEO of Corgibytes, will share immediately actionable communication principles that will help you; get buy-in for your ideas, reduce conflict and tension, increase productivity, be liked and respected.\n\nAndrea has taught communication skills to thousands of people in world-class brands across the globe, including The Smithsonian, The Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Verizon, and more. If you’re looking to take your career to the next level, this is one talk you won’t want to miss.\""
