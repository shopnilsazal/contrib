description: "DevOpsDays Boston 2017- Developer-first Workflows on Kubernetes by Richard Li\n\n\nKubernetes is a powerful, operational platform for containerized applications. However, the developer workflow on Kubernetes – how you code, deploy, update, and monitor your services – is much less mature.\n\nHow should you lay out your Git repo? How do you create loosely coupled services? How do you support deploying your service at any time?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll talk about these questions and more. We’ll discuss the journey towards a rapid development workflow, discuss best practices, and, talk about the process we followed to get to a rapid development workflow."
