description: "The answer is YES - you can learn to code on a smart phone - with the Grasshopper app. A neat way of combining both examples and quizzes to learn JavaScript on your mobile phone.\n\nALSO a rant on how to NOT learn through learn-how-to-code excercises. Very exciting!\n\nTry the app out at https://grasshopper.codes/ or look for Grasshopper in your app store. It is pretty fun."
