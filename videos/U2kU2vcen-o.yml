description: "Description from DEF CON 9 Speakerâ€™s Page:\n\nDistributed Intrusion Detection System Evasion\n\nDistributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDSE)\nA fast connection is the new era, but your IDS system can handle it?, your Operating System can handle it?. Can you handle it?.\n\nA DDoS is not the worse thing that an attacker can do in a distributed way. A evasion attack can take place while your IDS is just dropping packets, while it is just there checking an innumerable amount of unused packets with unused connections.\nThere is no tool such as this, or is it? DIDSE distributes the attack ranging the amount of packets to be sent to the network to cause a flood to even modem connections in a timing and hidden way the is virtually impossible to hide it, combined with some accuracy in penetration an attacker could easily bypass the new era security systems. He can bypass your IDS.\n\nEnrique A. Sanchez is an Industrial Engineer who previously worked as system administrator before becoming senior pen-tester in an european security firm. Enrqiue A. Sanchez is involved in education, R&D and pen-testing."
