Writing beautiful code is even more so.\n\nHow to write code that is pleasant to read, easy to understand and joy to maintain?\n\nSimple things like using right variable names, avoiding to much nesting, using white space and comments etc. makes a lot difference to readability of the code. Even though these things look very simple, even experienced programmers find it hard to put them in practice.\n\nIn this talk, Iâ€™ll try summarise the age old wisdom of writing beautiful code and explain those ideas using practical examples written in Python.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
