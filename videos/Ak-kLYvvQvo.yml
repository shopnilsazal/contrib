description: "by Rubin Simons \r\n\r\nOriginally, I wanted to do a talk which actually demonstrates the automated setup of a RHEL 4 or 5, Debian 4 or 5 or NetBSD 4 or 5 system live, and using the resulting system to deploy new systems. However, I think 15 minutes would be a little tight for that. I want to talk about: \r\n\r\n1: 5 minutes introduction: why openpcf 2: 5 minutes internals: how it works 3: 5 minutes results: what you can do with it \r\n\r\nOpenPCF (which stands for Open Provisioning and Control Framework) is an open-source, automated system configuration tool. It can generate configurations for any service that runs on a posix-like platform. Services like DHCP, DNS, HTTP, LDAP and many more are supported. \r\n\r\nOpenPCF aims to automate the often-times manual labour of configuring services on a computer system you've just setup. The ultimate goal is a system that sets up all services needed within a datacenter resulting in a computer system that can deploy (through tftp, dhcp, pxe, http, nfs, cifs) various operating systems. \r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nâ—¦http://www.openpcf.org/ \r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
