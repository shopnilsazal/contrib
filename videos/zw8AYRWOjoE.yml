description: "by: Aaron Patterson, Ben Bleything, Evan Phoenix, John Barnette, Rein Henrichs, Yossef Mendelssohn\n\nThis session is a panel featuring some of today's brightest -- and most opinionated -- Ruby personalities, moderated by Rein Henrichs. Topics up for debate include coding style, various patterns and anti-patterns (depending on who you ask), the state of the Ruby community, and any other contentious issues we can think of. Or, in the words of panel member Evan Phoenix: \"Five jerks on stage with alcohol and topics they don't agree on\". Come for a laugh but be prepared to learn something. Questions welcome. Panel members: The inimitable Evan Phoenix, the unspellable Yossef Mendelssohn, the indefatigable John Barnette, the unorthodox Aaron Patterson, and the antidisestablishmentarianist Ben Bleything."
