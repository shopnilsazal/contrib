language: English

description: "OWASP Juice Shop is a \"shooting star\" among broken web applications. To make sure it does not end as a \"one-hit wonder\", the project embraces principles and techniques that enhance its sustainability, e.g. Clean Code, TDD, CI/CD, Quality Metrics and Mutation Testing.\n\nIn this session you will see how\n- even a horrible language such as Javascript can be written in a maintainable manner\n- a complete and reliable test suite eliminates the \"fear of change\"\n- automation is a key to increased productivity - even for small open source projects\n- free-for-open-source SaaS tools can improve your development process\n\nWhere is light, there is shadow! You will also learn\n\n- about some limitations in the automation processes\n- the pain keeping Javascript dependencies up to date\n- why some 3rd party services had to be dropped\n\nIf the Internet gods are with us, we will even perform a production release of OWASP Juice Shop during the session!\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
