description: "So you are here at the only ruby conference in India, and have the following questions running through your mind:\n\nHow come there aren't more events like this in India where I can meet fellow ruby enthusiasts across the nation on a more frequent basis?\nIn fact, why isn't there an active ruby community in my home town? Why can't someone organize regular meetings so that I can get an opportunity to meet other local ruby developers in person and learn from them on a regular basis?\nHow would it be if every major city in India have a size-able ruby & rails community solving real-world problems in the local community and creating job opportunities galore for the local developers?\nFear not!\n\nThis talk will address all that and more, while exploring the numerous ways in which you - yes, you who are reading this - can contribute towards making the Ruby community in India to scale new heights, irrespective of how long you have been programming in ruby.\n\nBring your community building hat, and explore with me the beautiful future we could create together for the Indian ruby community!\"\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8X/"
