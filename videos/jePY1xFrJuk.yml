description: "Replacing Uppercase \"F\" Fucked with Uppercase Future: Active Participation in Response by Willowbl00\n\nNow that the beautiful promise of the internet has worn off, and we understand that it is not inherently equalizing, we can begin to realize our true roles as activists in closing social, economic, and opportunity gaps. The protocols we once thought were neutral are being used by established hierarchies to reenforce and strengthen their holds, to further detriments to the people at the bottom of those structures. willowbl00 will tell a story of hackerspaces and education, of technology in disaster response and civic voices, of tempered negotiations and paced arms races. With lots of examples of deployed initiatives, their downfalls and triumphs, this talk shows the future that is being built to prevent and amend continued atrocities. The future is here, but we have to fight to make it evenly distributed.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG9w/"
