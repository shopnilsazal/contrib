This talk covers recentadvancements in asynchronous tooling in Guile, as well as live demonstrationsof Guile used to power federation via the ActivityPub and ActivityStreamsstandards through Pubstrate.\n\nMuch has happened over the last year in terms of advancing network freedomboth within and external to Guile. We'll see a live demonstration ofPubstrate, a federated social networking toolkit as well as referenceimplementation for [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) and[ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/), written in andfor GNU Guile.\n\nAsynchronous programming has also gotten much more interesting in the lastyear for Guile hackers, with improvements in Guile core and new libraries suchas 8sync, A-Sync, and Fibers. An overview of these systems will be given, aswell as suggestions on how you can get hacking towards liberating networkusers today!\n\n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 12:15:00"
