description: "PyData Dallas 2015\nIPython has given us novel ways of interacting with our code, data, documentation, and reporting. It has enabled collaboration over common open source formats and APIs. Jupyter is the next step in this journey, extending support across languages for the notebook, multi user systems, and exposing more of the building blocks for advanced tooling upon these systems. We'll talk about the division of concerns between IPython and Jupyter (hint: same community/devs), what projects are available for consumption, what's at the bleeding edge, and directions we can head."
