It isn't a miracle cure. It isn't the security apocolypse. From the perspecitve of a practitioner who has been on a DevOps journey, we can explore the lessons learned - including surprises. This session will be a mixture of case study, lessons learned, future plans, and interactive discussion.\n\nSpeaker\n\nMatt Tesauro\nRackspace & OWASP Foundation\nMatt has been involved in the Information Technology and application development for more than 10 years.
