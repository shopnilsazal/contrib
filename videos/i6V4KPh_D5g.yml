description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nAutomating GPU Infrastructure for Kubernetes - Lucas Servén Marín, CoreOS (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nKubernetes has seen broad interest from the machine learning community and many users are bringing GPUs to their clusters. However, compiling, installing, and updating the NVIDIA kernel modules needed to run workloads on those GPUs continues to be a cumbersome and largely manual process. Furthermore, distributions like Container Linux, which update frequently can require new kernel modules every other week. In this presentation, Lucas Servén explains how to automate all of these operations for Kubernetes deployed on Container Linux and describes his experience running GPU Kubernetes clusters on both AWS and bare metal.\n\nAbout Lucas\nI am a Spanish software engineer currently working for CoreOS in Berlin. By trade I am a electrical engineer, with a Masters in robotics from UC Berkeley. After finishing my degree, I began at CoreOS, where I have been working on Tectonic and Kubernetes for the last year and a half and maintain the Kubernetes incubator project Spartakus. Kubecon EU would be my first time speaking in outside of an academic setting. Outside of work, I am passionate about deep learning and work on several machine learning projects with my twin brother. We are developing deep learning projects for portfolio optimization and AR. I love open source and recently have been filling my free time with: a Kubernetes operator for Jupyter notebooks, a Terraform provider for Vultr, and an application server for the YOLO image detection neural network.
