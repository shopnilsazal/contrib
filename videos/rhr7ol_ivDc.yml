description: "Welcome to the first episode of \"I don't know. Ask Chacko\". We hope you enjoy it and learn a few things from the Service Fabric Jedi Master. \n\nThis series is based on customer input (so, yours) across a number of channels. The idea is to answer your questions, well, to have Chacko answer your questions. He's got that suave style and calm, confident delivery that we think makes for an engaging Q&A experience with the equally charismatic Deep. Tune in. Learn.\n\nTweet questions to @ServiceFabric for use in future episodes! Thanks in advance. We love you.\n\n-- Service Fabric Team"
