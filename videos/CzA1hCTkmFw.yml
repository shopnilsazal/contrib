description: "The Perilous Future of Browser Security - Robert Hansen\n\nThe tradeoffs required to make a secure browser are often largely poorly understood even amongst the best of security people.  It makes sense since so few people actually work on browsers.  There is little knowledge about what it requires to make a browser safe enough to use when viewing hostile websites - against all known adversaries.  \n\nIn this presentation Mr. Hansen will cover how browsers are critically insecure, how they can be made to be secure, and what consumers forfeit in order to gain that extra level of security.  Lastly, the presentation will cover how to think about tradeoffs and what customers can live without.\n\n\nSpeaker\n\nRobert Hansen\nDirector of Product Management, WhiteHat Security\nRobert is the author of \"Detecting Malice\" and \"XSS Attacks: Cross Site Scripting Exploits and Defense\" and the noted ha.ckers.org web application security lab. He has spoken at industry conferences around the world and is widely considered to be a foremost expert in web application security and online fraud.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
