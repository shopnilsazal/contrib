description: "Cory Scott, LinkedIn\n\nA thorough understanding of how modern security principles impact SRE operations and the services they enable is key for any high-performing SRE organization. On the flip side, modern SRE practices can make the difference between an effective security organization and one that is left in the dust. SRE infrastructure and operations discipline are often more robust than anything being offered by outside security vendors.\n\nDuring this talk, Iâ€™ll address how security teams use SRE principles to better run security practices while also sharing how SRE teams can better apply key security principles. Attendees will come away with an understanding of how these teams are different but also complement each other.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
