language: English
recordingDate: 1525249594
description: "Finally the award-winning EclEmma code coverage plug-in for Eclipse became an Eclipse Foundation project and available by default in Java IDE starting from Oxygen! This is a good opportunity to summarize experiences and best practices, such as continuous inspection, for efficient use of the most popular open-source tool to measure Java code coverage that EclEmma integrates into Eclipse IDE - JaCoCo ( http://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/index.html ).\n\nThe presentation will present different use cases and guide you through different integration points that exist beside the Eclipse IDE. We will also talk about interoperability with other tools, common pitfalls and how to prevent them.\n\nAnd all this is for you exclusively firsthand by the insiders of the world of code quality - developers of SonarQube, JaCoCo and Eclipse EclEmma."
