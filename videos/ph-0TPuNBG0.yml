title: 'Machine Learning at scale: TensorFlow in the Cloud (Yufeng Guo)'
recordingDate: 1493710636
description: "Moving the heavy lifting of machine learning to the cloud is a great way to get large speed ups. This session will step through this process in detail, so that you'll be ready to scale your own training and prediction services.\n\nTensorFlow is an increasingly popular open source Machine Intelligence library that is especially well-suited for deep learning. The Google Cloud Machine Learning Platform (Cloud ML) lets you do distributed training and serving of your TensorFlow models at scale. \n\nWe start with an introduction to TensorFlow concepts and then walk through how to use Cloud ML to do distributed training and scalable serving of your trained models. We will explore the design decisions available to you in scaling up your machine learning, and talk about their tradeoffs."
