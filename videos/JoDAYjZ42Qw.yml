description: "by Jos√© Manuel Ortega\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nFootprinting is one of the most important techniques security auditing, sinceallows them gather information about the target we are analysing.\n\nIn the process to collect information about our target we can diferentiate twophases,the first one is where we obtain public information without interactwith the objective and the second one is where we can use tools such as portscanning.\n\nIn the process to collect information about our target we can diferentiate twophases, the first one is the passive where we obtain public information aboutour target without interact with the objective and the second one is the phasewhere we can use tools such as port scanning or banner grabbing.\n\nThese could be the talking points:\n\n1.Introduction to footprinting I will comment the main footprinting phases:\n\nPassive Footprinting where we collect public information and building a map ofthe server or domain objective, without interacting directwith it.\n\nActive Footprinting where there is an active target identification through andtechniques such as port scanning, and different identifications of services,operating systems and server banners.\n\n2.Footprinting tools\n\nFor applying footprinting techniques we can use tools for obtain domaininformation such as whois,apply inverse querys from DNS and name servers. Alsowe can use third services such as robtex and serversniff for obtain moreinformation. We can use public information sources,between these tools we canhighlight shodan,scans,zmap and censys\n\n3.Port scanning with nmap\n\nWith nmap we can check ports open for a target ip or domain and with nmapscripts we can check vulnerabilities in open ports For example,if the mysqlport is opened,check if the server has some vulnerability relationed with thisservice.I will show nmap scripts for checking this vulnerabilities.\n\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 10:00:00"
