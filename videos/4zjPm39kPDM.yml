title: '"Algorithms" is Not a Four-Letter Word  (Jamis Buck)'

description: 'Why does the word "algorithms" convey such a sense of musty dustiness? It doesn''t have to! Implementing algorithms can be a fantastic way to grow your craft, practice programming idioms and patters, learn new programming languages, and just generally have a good time! Come learn how to generate, navigate, and solve MAZES in a variety of ways. Be prepared to drink from a firehose as I walk (run?) through eleven maze generation algorithms and several ways to solve mazes, in just 45 minutes! You''ll never think of algorithms the same way again.'
