title: 'Beyond Open Source Configuration Management: Rapidly Building Any Cloud at Scale'
recordingDate: 1373575562
description: "Thomas Hatch, SaltStack, Inc.\nPresented at the 2013 USENIX Configuration Management Summit (UCMS '13)\n\nA new breed of open source software is expanding the horizons of traditional configuration management. These new tools are built for the speed and scale of any cloud and now provide remote execution, orchestration, and deployment of heterogeneous clouds and computing platforms; real-time infrastructure data; workflow automation; and efficient, fast communications in addition to configuration management. Thomas Hatch, creator of the Salt open source project, will detail the availability and usage of various open source management tools like ZeroMQ, Cobbler, Nova, Rundeck, Salt, and Jenkins, all of which were built for the requirements of cloud at scale to help automate data center management while building highly reliable compute resources. Attend this presentation to learn what the bleeding edge of open source holds for the future of configuration management."
