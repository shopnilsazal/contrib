description: "The introduction of Lambda Expressions, Optional, and Stream started a new page in Java history, inspired loads of new solutions and created a huge demand for Functional Programming libraries like Vavr(ex-Javaslang) - the Guava of Functional Programming in Java.\n\nDuring this talk, we will get our hands dirty and see what Vavr is and where it flourishes - everything without even a single static slide."
