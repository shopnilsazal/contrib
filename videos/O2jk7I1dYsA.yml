description: 'Everybody is now using virtualization, containers are all the rage today, and microkernels start to gain traction… But how is all this working? How did these solutions come to be? What are the differences between containers and virtual machines? Where and why should you use docker, runc, rocket, kvm, xen, virtualbox, includeOS, rancherOS? This talk is a full session providing understanding on how these technologies work, how they compare to each other, and lot’s of demo to understand differences and fundamental concept on isolation. So, let’s look under the hood, and understand how your system works (hint: it’s not magic). And yes, it will be understandable even if you are not an OPS or an expert. That’s precisely the point. Takeway is a short track around linux low level. Understanding WHAT is really a container behind the mist of dark magic docker/container marketing. Be able to ask yourself good questions about performances. From java expert to docker guru? Ok, let understand the last 10 years of linux kernel release notes you haven’t read.'
