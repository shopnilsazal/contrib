title: 'When Ruby Meets Java - The power of Torquebox by Rocky Jaiswal and Arun Agrawal'
recordingDate: 1337535756
description: "We all know the strengths of JRuby. It utilizes the scalability of JVM and provides real OS threads to Ruby. However, there are very few application servers that marry the expressiveness of JRuby with the power of Java. Torquebox is an application server which build upon the JBoss Server and provides enterprise features in Ruby.\n\nIn this session we will demonstrate a working application on Torquebox, and also demonstrate Torquebox features such as long running services, messaging and caching with live examples. We believe, these features offer the missing link between Ruby and enterprise integration. We will also offer some insight into the scalability / clustering features of Torquebox."
