title: 'Clyde Fare - How Python & the iPython notebook can revamp quantum chemical reseach'
recordingDate: 1397475981
description: 'Modern programs used in quantum chemistry represent an enormous number of man years of research and development. Their use has resulted in significant contributions to both chemistry and solid state physics and they remain key to research today. On the practical side however many of these programs are firmly lodged in a paradigm from another age requiring construction of complex text based input files to direct calculations and producing large quantities of text based output files that are not machine readable and are barely human readable. Further, the manner in which quantum chemical research is reported in the literature often makes reproducing the work of other scientists an unnecessarily onerous task. In this talk I will discuss how use of python wrappers and parsers together with the extended scientific python stack can change the way we construct and analyse calculations using Gaussian (the most popular quantum chemistry package) and how in combination with the IPython notebook we can transform the way quantum chemists share both the output of their research as well as the important lessons they learned along on the way.'
