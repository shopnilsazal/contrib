description: "Google Tech Talk\nApril 12, 2013\n(more info below)\nPresented by Randy McIntosh\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe Virtual Brain (TVB, thevirtualbrain.org) is an international project that uses real neuroimaging data to construct a simulation of the human brain.   Anatomical data setup the conduit for communication between different brain regions.  The dynamics for each region are generated from a library of nonlinear models, and produce large-scale activity patterns that can be compared directly to empirical functional data, such EEG/MEG or functional MRI.   The talk will present the core of the platform and its applications to understanding the structure-function interplay that forms the basis of cognitive architectures.  TVB's use of real data is also at the heart of a larger social neuroscience initiative, wherein small groups of people interact with TVB through wireless EEG headsets, modifying an immersive audiovisual environment that mimics a dream -- My Virtual Dream.  The goal is to make use of individual brain signals to augment the group experience through TVB.  The two avenues of development for TVB will inform neurally-inspired computing architectures and the evolution of interactive devices that can use a person's physiology to redesign their experience. \n\nSpeaker Info:\n\nRandy McIntosh, PhD. \nProfessor, Department of Psychology, University of Toronto\nDirector, Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest Centre"
