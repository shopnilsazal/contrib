Attend and you'll understand how to turn ANY MP3 into a weapon, a study aid, a hidden calming session or helping you experience that Ah-Ha moment of discovery simply by injecting an alternate data stream attack made up of psychosonic frequencies.\n\nYou'll learn how different mental states can be created using frequencies that interact with the brain, how the military is using this attack vector, how Vegas uses these same techniques on customers, which open source software creates these frequency generated psychic states and sites so you can continue your adventures in psychosonics. Multiple new attacks based on psychosonics will be demonstrated and fully explained to you can easily integrated these into you attack tools.\n\nThis is an \"attack the audience\" session where you'll actually experience these psychosonic attacks so you can judge their effectiveness for yourself. Better yet, you'll understand how to incorporate this attack vector into your future attack surface. Hey, psychosonics is much better than the flame thrower bra she already has!\n\nBrad Smith, RN, ASCIE, BS-Psy MCNPS, CISSP, NSA-IAM became fascinated with computers in 1972 and hasn't burned out yet!
