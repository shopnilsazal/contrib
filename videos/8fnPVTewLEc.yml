description: "As the development team behind an anonymous social network that has become one of the fastest growing apps in the Apple Store, we'll do a detailed dive into the architecture of this very big Erlang/OTP app. The original architecture was Riak-based and in a series of dire moments we had to replace it with a SQL database due to TCP Incast, a network problem affecting Riak map/reduce under heavy load in certain network topologies. We'll talk about when and when not to use Riak. Our caching infrastructure, heavy use of gproc and pg2 for cross-server communication, socket connection infrastructure, novel use of Erlang processes in conjunction with Elastic Search for location based search, and scalable bayesian spam filtering will all be covered.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGcc/"
