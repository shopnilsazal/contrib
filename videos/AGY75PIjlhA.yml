description: "Description from DEF CON 9 Speakerâ€™s Page:\n\nHacker Doctrine in Information Warfare\n\nIt is now an accepted fact that computer hackers, crackers, hacktivists, virus writers, and other politically-aware individuals in the computer underground are 'taking matters into their own hands.'\_ Whether through website defacements or full-scale denial-of-service attacks, non-governmental, non-aligned individuals and groups are conducting what the military refers to as 'information operations' of increasing sophistication.\n\nWhat is clearly missing in these independent operations, however, is a complete and thorough understanding of how to think about attacks, how to undertake 'mission planning,' and how to be truly effective.\_ Based on our own understanding of practical applications in information warfare, 7Pillars Partners will present educational material on information operations that can help fill in these 'gaps' in a hacker's comprehensive understanding.\n\nMichael Wilson is the Managing Partner of 7Pillars Partners, with 20 years field experience in military and intelligence operations. He is an inventor, pioneer, and an acknowledged leader in infrastructural warfare, information operations, open source intelligence, and next-generation intelligence. He is the winner of the U.S. National Defense University's Sun Tzu Award in 1997, and the G2 Intelligence Professional Award in both 1997 and 1998. Mr. Wilson can be reached at partners@7pillars.com, and a number of his professional papers are available at http://www.7pillars.com/."
