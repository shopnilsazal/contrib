description: "www.pydata.org\n\nPyData is a gathering of users and developers of data analysis tools in Python. The goals are to provide Python enthusiasts a place to share ideas and learn from each other about how best to apply our language and tools to ever-evolving challenges in the vast realm of data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with tutorials for novices, advanced topical workshops for practitioners, and opportunities for package developers and users to meet in person.\n\nPyData NYC 2014\nIPython recently introduced a new framework for interactive javascript widgets in their online notebook. These widgets allow one to easily create and interact with buttons, sliders, text fields, and other HTML/Javascript objects from Python code. The framework has also been used for advanced systems of widgets, such as WebGL 3d graphics and interactive maps. I will discuss and give examples of how to write simple and complicated widgets, demonstrate complicated widget examples such as the pythreejs widget collection for interactive 3d graphics (https://github.com/jasongrout/pythreejs), and discuss changes in the widget infrastructure in the upcoming IPython 3.0. Since this is an advanced talk, it would be most helpful if participants worked through the widget tutorial notebooks at http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/Interactive%20Widgets/Index.ipynb before the talk."
