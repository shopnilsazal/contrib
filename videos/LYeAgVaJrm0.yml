In this lightning talk I'll talk you through an Istio sample application incorporating all major features. The sample will be released on github and will also run on minikube.\n\nAbout Josef\nJosef Adersberger is #cloudnativenerd, CNCF member, and co-founder & CTO of QAware, an independent cloud native software manufacturer that has been repeatedly awarded Best IT Workplace in Germany.
