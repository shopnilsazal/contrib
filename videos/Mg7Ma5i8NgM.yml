description: "In this series we'll go from start to finish in building a fully functioning high-fidelity prototype with OAuth2 authentication and API connections fetching real data. The user will experience the prototype with her own stuff in it!\n\nLet's build a prototype that's actually working to prove our point to stakeholders!\n\nWhen you as a designer take steps beyond HTML and CSS and head into real code, YOU have the power!\n\nWe do this by using React JS https://reactjs.org/ - a great JavaScript framework for building front-end components. We will even do some back-end to handle authentication eventually.\n\nAnd yes, this is not Travis - David and MPJ are filling in!\n\nMattias on YouTube: Fun Fun Function\nhttps://www.youtube.com/funfunfunction\n\nDavid on YouTube: Data David\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0TQC6ZPNm23dU6ecc5x0Gg\n\n- - -\n\nThis video was sponsored by the DevTips Patron Community - https://www.patreon.com/DevTips\n\nListen to Travis' Podcast - http://www.travandlos.com/\n\nGet awesomeness emailed to you every thursday - http://travisneilson.com/notes \n\nYou should follow DevTips on Twitter - https://twitter.com/DevTipsShow"
