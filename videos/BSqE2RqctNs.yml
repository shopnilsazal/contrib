description: "GitOps - Operations by Pull Request [B] - Alexis Richardson, Weaveworks & William Denniss, Google\n\nGitOps is the latest exciting evolution in empowering developers to do operations and CICD. Imagine describing your entire infra in Git declaratively and then continually using that to verify your state. Well, with Kubernetes, and tools like Terraform, and Ansible, you can. We've taken this forward by adding continuous diffs and alerting - and even some of our observability stack itself. An introduction is here: https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request\n\nWilliam (Google PM) and Alexis (Weaveworks, CNCF) will talk about how we jointly developed this pattern based around our own use cases. We shall make reference to other companies using the approach like Github and Atlassian. This is NOT a product pitch - we are going to teach you the PATTERNS.\n\nAbout William Denniss\nWilliam is a Product Manager at Google and works on Google Cloud and Kubernetes. He has a passion for open source and open standards, is the author of several IETF Internet-Drafts including OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps, and founded AppAuth, the leading open source OAuth client for native apps.\n\nAbout Alexis Richardson\nAlexis is the co-founder and CEO of Weaveworks. He is also the chairman of the TOC for CNCF, and the co-founder of the Coed:Code meet ups.\n\nPreviously he was at Pivotal, as head of products for Spring, RabbitMQ, Redis, Apache Tomcat and vFabric. Alexis was responsible for resetting the product direction of Spring and transitioning the vFabric business from VMware. \n\nAlexis co-founded RabbitMQ, and was CEO of the Rabbit company acquired by VMware in 2010, where he worked on numerous cloud platforms. Rumours persist that he co-founded several other software companies including Cohesive Networks, after a career as a prop trader in fixed income derivatives, and a misspent youth studying and teaching mathematical logic."
