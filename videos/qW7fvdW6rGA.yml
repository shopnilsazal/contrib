description: "Description\nThis session will provide a high-level primer on the burgeoning field of Deep Learning and the reasons why it is important. It will provide the fundamentals surrounding feature learning and neural networks required for deep learning. As well, this session will provide a quick start for TensorFrames for Apache Spark.\n\nAbstract\nThis session will provide a high-level primer on the burgeoning field of Deep Learning and the reasons why it is important. It will provide the fundamentals surrounding feature learning and neural networks required for deep learning; more specifically:\n\n-What is Deep Learning?\n-A primer on feature learning\n-What is feature engineering?\n-What is TensorFlow?\n-Introducing TensorFrames\n-TensorFrames â€“ quick start\nIn addition to reviewing the concepts, we will have demos and provide links to notebooks that attendees will be able to use.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
