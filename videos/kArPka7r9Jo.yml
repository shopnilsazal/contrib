description: "As you consider the shift from waterfall to agile, or agile to DevOps, there is more to think about than just architecture. Peter Chestna, the Director of Developer Engagement at Veracode, led Veracode's transition from Waterfall to DevOps and in turn has helped hundreds of customers do the same. Join us as Peter shares his own case study, how Veracode reengineered its own architecture but more importantly the overall process including team structure, the technologies to build a robust pipeline, security considerations and the cultural shifts required.\n\nWhat you will learn:\n\n* A basic understanding of Waterfall, Agile and DevOps from a people, process and technology point of view\n* Considerations when transitioning between these methodologies including org structure, process changes and technical debt\n* An approach to leading the change in your own company\n*How security can best be integrated deeply into DevOps to keep schedule risk to a minimum and velocity high\n\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
