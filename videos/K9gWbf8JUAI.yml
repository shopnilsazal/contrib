description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #10\n29 November 2017\nSponsored and Hosted by Kenshoo\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nIn this talk we will discuss a hackathon project in which we attempted to generate new episodes of The Simpsons, using data science tool. We will see the general approach, the data we had, but more importantly, the data we hadn't and how we compensated for it. We will also deep dive into two technical problems we encountered during the project and are of general interest:\n\n- The first is speaker recognition, for which we'll discuss the MFCC features and how they can be used for classification.\n\n- The second is semantic sentence similarity, for which we'll discuss the Word Mover's Distance, its origin and usage.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
