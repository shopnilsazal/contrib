title: 'Using actors for The Internet of (Lego) Trains by Johan Janssen'

description: "Last year we started a new Internet of Things project: The Internet of (Lego) Trains. We wanted to figure out if we could use the same languages and tools we used on servers on IoT hardware.\n\nThe Lego trains are equipped with a Raspberry Pi, camera, wireless dongle, infrared transmitter, speaker, RFID reader and battery pack. Next to that we have automated switch tracks and camera's again with the help of Raspberry Pi's. To control the trains and other parts we built an actor based application with Scala, Akka, Akka HTTP and AngularJS.\n\nThe session will cover when and how to use Akka HTTP and remote actors to create a new generation of applications. The results of the performance tests we did to compare the two options will be shown as well. A live demo is of course included."
