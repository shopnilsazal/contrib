description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nBlackholes and Wormholes: Understand and Troubleshoot the “Magic” of Kubernetes Networking - Minhan Xia & Rohit Ramkumar, Google (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nNetworking is hard. Kubernetes networking can be even harder. On one hand, kubernetes provides a nice abstraction of infrastructure underneath. On the other hand, k8s contributors and cluster operators bear the burden to seal the gap. Especially for kubernetes networking, it has to work seamlessly with both k8s internals and underlying infrastructure. This brings challenges for understanding and troubleshooting the system. In this talk, we will share real-world experience in running Google Kubernetes Engine and explore the pain points in the current kubernetes networking design, troubleshooting best practices and future improvements.\n\nAbout Minhan\nMinhan Xia has been a member of Kubernetes networking team at Google since 2015. He has contributed to various aspects of K8s networking, including pod networking, K8s service and K8s ingress.\n\nAbout Rohit\nRohit joined Google in August 2017 as a SWE working on GKE Networking and has been working on better monitoring and testing of core GKE systems. Previously, Rohit interned with Google working on Cloud Pub/Sub."
