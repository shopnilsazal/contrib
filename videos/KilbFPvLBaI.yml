recordingDate: 1338996137
description: 'Threads versus events: which should you choose? How about both? In this talk you''ll learn about the Celluloid concurrency framework, which combines OOP and the Actor Model to give you concurrent Ruby objects. You''ll also learn about how Celluloid lets you combine blocking I/O and asynchronous evented I/O, offering you all the benefits of EventMachine without the restrictions of a single event loop. The talk will also provide a brief introduction to DCell, a distributed extension to Celluloid.'
