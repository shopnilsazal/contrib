description: "Mind Over Error by Michel Martens\n\nIndustries like aviation and power plants have improved their safety mechanisms using our growing understanding of the nature of human error, but have we kept up? How do we incorporate the ideas from Human Error, The Design of Everyday Things, and other great resources into what we build? I want to show you how to improve the safety of our systems by reducing their complexity and generating accurate mental models.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H0cY/"
