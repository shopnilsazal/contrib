description: 'We all know how vulnerable IoT devices are - but do we know if our home or industrial IoT devices are being attacked or already compromised? This talk focuses on creating an Intrusion Detection System for IoT devices using Wi-Fi to connect to the Internet. We will look at how to automatically fingerprint our IoT devices over the air and detect attacks such as Honeypots, MAC spoofing, DoS etc. We will also see how to do deep packet inspection and learn device behavior over the network (which hosts do they usually connect to, which protocols?, traffic characteristics?, heartbeat mechanisms? etc.) using simple Machine Learning techniques. We will show how this allows us to detect compromised devices which might now be controlled by a remote attacker. Our IDS will use an external sensor which will be build using open source tools and off-the-shelf hardware. All code will be open sourced after the talk.'
