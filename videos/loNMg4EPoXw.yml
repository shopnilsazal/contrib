You don’t have to buy into Agile, DevOps or CI/CD to realize the business wants to move faster. And it's not like you didn’t already have more than enough to do. This talk will cover how to take the lessons learned from forward thinking software development and show you how they have been applied across several business. This isn’t a theoretical talk. It covers the results of successfully applying these strategies to AppSec across multiple companies ranging from 4,000 to 40,000+ employees. Yes, real stats on improvements seen will be provided.\n\nBeyond providing concrete examples of how to optimize your AppSec program, the talk will cover how to take your small merry band of AppSec professionals and scale it up to a virtual army. By taking the best of DevOps, CI/CD and Agile, you can iteratively up your AppSec game over time and begin your ascent out of the security hole you are in. It will also introduce several new OWASP projects which will help you on your journey: the OWASP AppSec Pipeline project, OWASP Defect Dojo and the AppSec Pipeline toolbox. This talk’s content plus these open source projects are more than you’ll need to get started buying down the technical security debt and unshackle you from traditional AppSec thinking.\n\nMatt Tesauro\nOWASP Foundation\nMatt Tesauro is currently working full-time for the OWASP Foundation, adding automation and awesome to OWASP projects.
