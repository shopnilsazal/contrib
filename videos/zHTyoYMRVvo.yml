title: 'Burlington Ruby Conf 2013 Handcrafting Community by Carina C. Zona'
recordingDate: 1376251211
description: "Community-building can seem like a herculean effort that must be coordinated among many. But it doesn't have to be. One is plenty.\n\nHow can we handcraft a fulfilling code career? How can we support peers in developing theirs, whether newcomer or artisan? How can we contribute, without having to be expert? How do we develop social capital among community members, and channel those investments into people who are just entering? How will we craft a thriving community, using only simple tools & scarce local resources?\n\nWe'll examine the history of major successes -- in Ruby community, Python, and well beyond -- and extract lessons to apply generally. It's a story that weaves in personal narratives of rising into that, both well and clumsily. It's about transforming minor ambitions & frequent iterations into a scope of change that looks amazing. By making choices to do small things well and thoughtfully, rather than with concern for how they scale.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8x/"
