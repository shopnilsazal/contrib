title: 'YOW! West 2016 Tony Morris - Parametricity, Functional Programming, Types'
recordingDate: 1470548252
description: "In this talk, we define the principle of functional programming, then go into detail about what becomes possible by following this principle. In particular, parametricity (Wadler, 1989) and exploiting types in API design are an essential property of productive software teams, especially teams composed of volunteers as in open-source. This will be demonstrated.\n\nSome of our most important programming tools are neglected, often argued away under a false compromise. Why then, are functional programming and associated consequences such as parametricity so casually disregarded? Are they truly so unimportant? In this talk, these questions are answered thoroughly and without compromise.\n\nWe will define the principle of functional programming, then go into detail about common problems to all of software development. We will build the case from ground up and finish with detailed practical demonstration of a solution to these problems. The audience should expect to walk away with a principled understanding and vocabulary of why functional programming and associated techniques have become necessary to software development.\n\nTony Morris is a software product developer who has deployed functional programming techniques in industry for over 10 years. Tony teaches at the tertiary level and for professional programmers with a view toward producing a viable commercial result. Tony is currently a Senior Software Engineer at NICTA where he is tasked with promoting and educating on functional programming for the benefit of all Australian software developers.\n\nTony takes a fastidious, principled approach to functional programming both when deployed in practice and when in a learning environment to ensure maximum yield from the effort. Tony believes that exploring principles and the following consequences provides a rewarding experience for all involved.\n\nFor more on YOW! West, visit http://west.yowconference.com.au"
