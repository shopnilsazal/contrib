description: "by Kaushal M\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nGlusterD-2.0 (GD2) is a new implementation of the GlusterFS management daemon,which attempts to fix a lot of issues with the current management daemon.\n\nThis talk will give the listeners an overview of the problems that GD2 isattempting to solve and how it solves them.\n\nGlusterFS is a highly modular distributed filesystem. The translator modelused by GlusterFS allows new filesystem features to be easily developed andincluded in GlusterFS.\n\nBut the GlusterFS management daemon, GlusterD, makes it hard for developers toactually get their new features into the hands of end users. Almost any newfilesystem feature needs to have code written for it in GlusterD to ensure itis actually available for use. GlusterD, unlike the rest of GlusterFS, is asingle monolithic, with a very large, undocumented and hard to navigate codebase. This makes it very hard for feature developers to integrate theirfeature in GlusterD. In addition to this, GlusterD makes it harder forGlusterFS to scale, harder to integrate with external projects and takes up alot of maintenance effort.\n\nGlusterD-2.0 (GD2) is a ground up re-implementation of the management daemon,designed from the beginning to overcome the above problems. GD2 and itsinternal frameworks are designed to be flexible, extensible and pluggable. GD2makes it easier for developers to integrate their newer features intoGlusterFS as well as allow easier integration of GlusterFS and other projects.In this talk, we'll be covering how GD2 and the new frameworks work to solvethe problems above.\n\nThis talk will be useful for developers interested in working on/withGlusterFS, users who want to understand how GlusterFS manages itself andpeople with a general interest in management and distributed systems.\n\n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 08:00:00"
