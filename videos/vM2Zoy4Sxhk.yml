description: "\"Type Annotations in Python 3: Whats, whys & wows!\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - Arengo]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nPython 3.5 introduced support for \"\"type hints\"\" (or annotations), which allows us to annotate our code with useful bits of information without affecting its runtime behavior. Type hints don't enforce a particular use case and can therefore be used for many purposes.\n\nIn my talk, I will explain some of the use cases of type hints, and show how we can use them to e.g. make our code more secure or teach it new tricks. We will have a look at popular libraries that help us to use the power of type hints (e.g. mypy), but we will also see how we can build our own extensions on top of the type hint system.\n\nAfter the talk you should walk away with a solid (basic) understanding of type hints in Python and an idea of how they might be useful to you now or in the future. \n\nTyping and type hints in programming languages\nShort history and motivation of type hints in Python\nBasics of type hint syntax and semantics\nUse cases for type hints\nType hints for code analysis: mypy and similar libraries\nBuilding new stuff with type hints in Python\nSummary, Outlook & Further Reading\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
