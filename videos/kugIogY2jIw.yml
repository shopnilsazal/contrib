title: 'Cascadia Ruby 2013 Fluent Refactoring by Sam Livingston-Gray'
recordingDate: 1385745094
description: "Fluency is \"what you can say without having to think about how to say it.\" \"Refactoring\" is a language that describes ways to make your code suck less. I want to inspire you to become more fluent in that language, so you can make your code suck less without having to think about it.\n\nI'll walk you through the process of reworking a 50-line Rails controller action that's hard to comprehend, let alone refactor. We'll tease apart fiendishly intertwined structures, embrace duplication until we grok what it's telling us, use evil hacks to our advantage, and uncover responsibilities—and bugs!—that weren't obvious at first glance.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG5M/"
