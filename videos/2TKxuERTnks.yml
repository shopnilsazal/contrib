description: 'Tired of Makefile hacks? Bazel offers fast, reproducible builds for software of any size. Why is it better than go build? Bazel makes polyglot projects easy, has remote build workers, and shared caching. Get started building Go projects, learn key concepts, and get ready to turbocharge your build.'
