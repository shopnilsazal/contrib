recordingDate: 1336060458
description: "Are you having trouble launching new features because of friction between development and operations? At CustomInk, we've reduced this friction by making changes to our teams, processes, and tools. Come find out what we've been up to and learn how you can implement similar changes in your own environment.\n\nThere's always a bit of tension when getting features from idea to production. In this talk, we'll look at some of the changes CustomInk has made to reduce this friction and keep the new features coming. Gone are the days of bi-monthly deploys, office pools dedicated to guessing when this deploy will be rolled back, and the ceremony surrounding the deploy-rollback-fix-deploy cycle. Today, ideas flow from product managers to developers to production with ease thanks to a number of changes that we've made to our teams, processes and tools.\n\nDuring this talk, we'll look at:\n\nHow product managers drive the release cycle\n\nIdeas and customer feedback\nPrioritizing development requests\nManaging branch merges and deployments (yes, product managers can help here!)\nHow operations enables developer productivity\n\nSpinning up development environments - Vagrant, Chef\nInfrastructure Automation - Chef\nEnabling Continuous Deployment - Capistrano and caphub\nFailing gracefully - Fault-tolerant load balancing with ldirectord\nHow developers get their code running in production\n\nStaging environments\nContinuous Integration - Jenkins, Green Screen\nStaying on topic: Deploying changes when they're ready\nGetting rid of the over-the-wall mentality - Dev & Ops working together\n\nEnabling developers to do it themselves\nPair programing infrastructure automation\nKeeping the process light and the communication flowing"
