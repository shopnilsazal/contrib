title: 'Sinking Your Hooks in Applications - Richard Meester & Joe Rozner - AppSecUSA 2015'

description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2015 in San Francisco\nhttps://2015.appsecusa.org/\n\nSinking Your Hooks in Applications\n\nAttackers typically have more compute resources and can spend much more time breaking components of applications than the engineers that write them in the first place. Since the pressure is on developers to release new code, even at the expense of security best practices, expecting all application vulnerabilities to be detected and remediated in advance of an applicationâ€™s release is unrealistic to say the least.\n\nOne approach to combat this is to automatically build more security into the applications themselves. In this talk, the speakers will demonstrate some techniques to leverage the hooking of potentially vulnerable code paths in production applications and injecting code to introduce additional layers of security without requiring developers to write any code or recompile the applications. Specific examples will be given of hooking Java, .NET and Ruby frameworks.\n\n\nRichard Meester\nSoftware Engineer, Prevoty\nRichard's primary focus is developing solutions for XSS/SQLi detection and protection in the .NET framework.\n\nJoe Rozner\nSoftware Engineer, Prevoty\nJoe Rozner is a software engineer at Prevoty where he has built semantic analysis tools, worked to develop new methods to more accurately detect SQL injection and Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and designed novel integration technology leveraging runtime patching.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
