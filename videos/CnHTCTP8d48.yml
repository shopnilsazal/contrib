title: 'Role based access control (RBAC) policies in Kubernetes'
recordingDate: 1529450646
description: "RBAC policies are vital for the correct management of your cluster, as they allow you to specify which types of actions are permitted depending on the user and their role in your organization.\nThis webinar will go through the essential RBAC concepts and objects in Kubernetes, as well as show some basic use cases.\n\nExamples include:\n\n- Secure your cluster by granting privileged operations (accessing secrets, for example) only to admin users.\n- Force user authentication in your cluster.\n- Limit resource creation (such as pods, persistent volumes, deployments) to specific namespaces. You can also use quotas to ensure that resource usage is limited and under control.\n- Have a user only see resources in their authorized namespace. This allows you to isolate resources within your organization (for example, between departments)."
