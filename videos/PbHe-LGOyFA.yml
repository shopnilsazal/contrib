description: "PyData Seattle 2015\nSoftware and computers are everywhere, revolutionizing every field around us. But the majority of schools don't teach computer science. Code.org believes every student should have the opportunity to shape the 21st-century and wants to turn this problem around. Code.org has already helped over 100 million students try computer science for the first time with one Hour of Code, partnered with 70+ school districts to bring courses to schools, released a free online learning platform with 10% of students in K-8 US schools enrolled. We've helped change policy in 16 states to better support computer science. This is just the beginning of a bold vision to bring this foundational field to every K-12 public school by 2020."
