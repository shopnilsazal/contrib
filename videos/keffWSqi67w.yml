description: "Description\nIn this talk I will introduce a Python-based, deep learning gesture recognition model. The model is deployed on an embedded system, works in real-time and can recognize 25 different hand gestures from a simple RGB webcam stream. it uses a simple laptop camera and allows for building playful user interfaces that are controlled with hand gestures. Lastly I will show a demo of such application.\n\nAbstract\nIn this talk I will introduce a Python-based, deep learning gesture recognition model. The model is deployed on an embedded system, works in real-time and can recognize 25 different hand gestures from simple webcam stream. In contrast to traditional vision-based gesture controllers like the Microsoft Kinect, our system requires no depth information. The development of such an architecture is a complex process that requires careful consideration during each step. I will guide you through our process and share the lessons we learned. This includes: our large-scale crowd-acting operation to collect over 150,000 short video clips, our process to decide which deep learning framework to use, the development of a network architecture that allows for classifications of video clips solely with RGB input frames, the iterations necessary to make the neural network run in real-time on embedding devices, and lastly, the discovery and development of playful gesture-based applications.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
