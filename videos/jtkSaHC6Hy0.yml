Regularization can reduce uncertainty when interpreting variables and making predictions, leading to better results. Bayesians and Frequentists implement this in different ways; prior distributions for the former, penalized regression for the latter. We examine how the techniques differ and how they are similar and even explore a Bayesian interpretation of the lasso (L1 Penalized Regression) that should make both sides happy."
