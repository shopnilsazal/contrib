description: "AGL as a generic secured industrial embedded Linux Factory production line controllers  requirements are not that special\nby Dominig ar Foll\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThere is no de facto secured embedded Linux distro while the requirement isbecoming more and more critical with raise of IoT in Industrial domains. Whenlooking under the hood of the Yocto built AGL project, it is obvious that itcan fit 95% of the most common requirements as a Secured Embedded Linux. Wewill look how non Automotive industries can easily reuse the AGL code andtools to build their own industrial product and why it's a safer bet than tobuild it internally.\n\nIndustrial IoT cannot be successful without a serious improvement of thesecurity coverage. Unfortunately there is as today, no of-the-shelves offerand the skills required to create such solution, are at best rare, more oftenout of reach. AGL as created a customizable embedded Linux distro which isnicely designed for reuse in many domains outside of Automotive. During thepresentation we will see how to: \\- start your development with boards readilyavailable on the Net, \\- change the BSP and add peripherial using Yocto layersor project like MRAA, \\- integrate a secure boot in your platform, \\- add yourmiddleware and your application without breaking the maintained Core OS \\-develop a UI on the integrated screen and/or an HTML remote brower \\- updatethe core OS and your add-ons. \\- get support and influence the project.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.120 (Chavanne)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 17:00:00"
