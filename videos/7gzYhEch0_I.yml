description: "Luke Faraone, Dropbox\n\nEvery organization has a system for access control be it spreadsheet, LDAP, IAM, something home grown, or all of the above. Most of these approaches suffer from some combination of hard to use interfaces, incomplete coverage, lack of audit/compliance functionality, and bottlenecks for permission grants.\n\nMerou is Dropbox's homegrown, open source authorization service. It manages a wide range of environments--from the corporate network, to production data centers, and cloud providers like AWS. And it is a transparent system of record that is managed in a decentralized manner by the individuals and teams that own applications and services Merou provides authorization for.\n\nWe will present a general overview of our approach, highlight the features that make this system unique, sample some of our current use cases, and present some lessons learned.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
