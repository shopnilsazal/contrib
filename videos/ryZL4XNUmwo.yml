description: "PyData NYC 2014\n(or: how to only forget some things about your ML models instead of literally everything)\n\nYou're writing a classifier. So you trained 10 decision trees in October, with several sets of training data, different maximum depths, different scalings, and different features. Some of the experiments went better than others! Now it's November, and you want to go back to the project and start using one of these models. But which one?!\n\nAt Stripe, we train models to automatically detect and block fraudulent transactions in real time. We build a lot of models, and we need a way to keep track of all kinds of information about them. I'll talk about a simple tool we built to:\n\nkeep track of a few evaluation metrics for each model (precision vs recall, ROC curve)\nremember which features, training data, and parameters we used\nchoose which threshold to use\nThis functions as a lightweight lab notebook for ML experiments, and been incredibly useful for us (as mere humans). Having a consistent way to look at the results of our experiments means we can compare models on equal footing. No more notes, no more forgetting, no more hand-crafted artisanal visualizations. [1]\n\n[1] You're still allowed to make hand-crafted artisanal visualizations if you want."
