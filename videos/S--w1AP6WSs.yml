description: "By, Brad Grzesiak\nLet's learn us a space exploration! In this talk, Brad will wax poetic on the particulars of getting into space, getting around in space, and getting things done in space. Extraterrestrial mining, orbital insertion, and how rockets work by smashing molecules together. There may or may not be any math, programming, or vacuum-induced hypoxia in this talk.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGYW/"
