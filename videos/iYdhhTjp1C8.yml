description: "By Adrian Bowyer\r\n\r\nThis talk will start by briefly introducing RepRap - the replicating rapid prototyper.\r\n\r\nThe talk will then look at how a growth of replicator technology may change economic activity, society, and the nature of wealth. Material costs for a RepRap are currently about 350 EUR. That means that RepRap is accessible to small communities in the developing world as well as to individuals in the developed world. The designs for the RepRap machine are being is distributed free to everyone using the GPL - so people can copy the machines to their friends without limit.\r\n\r\nFinally it will examine replicator technology in the biological context, considering both it and human beings to be collaborating and competing replicators in a Darwinian ecology.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
