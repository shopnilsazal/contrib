description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nExperience Report - Evolving a Continuous Delivery Workflow to Kubernetes using Spinnaker - Gard Rimestad, Schibsted & Øyvind Ingebrigtsen Øvergaard, Finn.no (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nSchibsted started deploying to Kubernetes with Spinnaker about a year ago. In that time, application deployment has evolved from simple point and click pipelines in Spinnaker to being fully defined as code with custom integrations against Kubernetes. The combination of everything-as-code and using contracts and conventions to abstract irrelevant details, has simplified configuration and led to improved usability and reduced maintenance. Gard and Øyvind will talk about Schibsted's journey, motivations for each step of the progression, key lessons learned, and challenges still to come.\n\nAbout Gard\nGard is an engineer that lives for traceable, stable and fast delivery pipelines. The weekly number of production deployments is why he goes to work. When he is not working on optimizations of deployment, he goes into his man cave and plays with arduino, raspberry, quadcopter or 3d printer projects. Active contributor on Spinnaker. Previous speaking experience: - 2017 Devoxx Belgium - Spinnaker - get control over your deployments - https://cfp.devoxx.be/2017/talk/RTU-8006 - 2017 Spinnaker summit: - Talk - Spinnaker at Schibsted - Panel discussion - Spinnaker’s Kubernetes Integration - Panel discussion - Operating Spinnaker - 2016 AWS Meetup - Deployments pipelines in Spinnaker - https://www.meetup.com/AWS-User-Group-Norway/events/233922802/\n\nAbout Øyvind\nDeveloper, ops-er and everything in between-er. Currently interested in leveraging modern infrastructure to build robust systems that support delivering applications continuously. Has been using Kubernetes in production since 1.1. Previous speaking experience: - Kubecon EU 2017 - “Lessons Learned From Maintaining Continuous Delivery While Migrating From a Static Infrastructure to Kubernetes” (with co-speaker) http://sched.co/9Tbo - Booster 2017, Software 2017 - “Moving FINN.no to the cloud” (norwegian, with co-speaker) - Pycon.se 2014 - “Deploying enterprise services 60 times a day using Python."
