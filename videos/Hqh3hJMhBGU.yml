description: "Reactive programming is an old idea with new urgency for creating highly scalable and resilient services. How should we write Reactive Programs? This talk examines the core traits required, as described in the Reactive Manifesto (http://reactivemanifesto.org), which strikes a balance between specifying the essential features for reactive systems and allowing implementation variations appropriate for each language and execution environment.\n\nWe’ll begin by establishing the importance of functional programming as a basis for building reactive applications as dataflow systems. Then we’ll compare and contrast different techniques, including Functional Reactive Programming (FRP), Reactive Extensions (Rx), Reactive Streams, and building blocks like callbacks, actors, and futures. We’ll assess their relative strengths and weaknesses, from which we’ll draw lessons for building reactive applications more effectively."
