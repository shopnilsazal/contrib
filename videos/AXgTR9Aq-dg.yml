language: English
recordingDate: 1501622229
description: "Your system is worth nothing if it's not available. Failures will happen though, so it's important to handle them gracefully.\n\nIn this talk we'll look into likely causes of out-of-memory errors, saturated thread pools and other outcomes of failure scenarios that can bring your system down. How to write applications that successfully cope with such scenarios? How to quickly find root causes of stability issues in production?\n\nCome and listen to stories of 3 years of running (and breaking) microservices at Allegro. No fluff, just stuff."
