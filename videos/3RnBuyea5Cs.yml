recordingDate: 1418401084
description: "By, Evan Chan\nThis session introduces you to Spark by starting with something basic: Scala collections and functional data transforms. We then look at how Spark expands the functional collection concept to enable massively distributed, fast computations. The second half of the talk is for those of you who want to know the secrets to make Spark really fly for querying tabular datasets. We will dive into row vs columnar datastores and the facilities that Spark has for enabling interactive data analysis, including Spark SQL and the in-memory columnar cache. Learn why Scala's functional collections are the best foundation for working with data!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FnIU/"
