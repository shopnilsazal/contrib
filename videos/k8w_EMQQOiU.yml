description: "\"I don't like Mondays-what I learned about data engineering after 2 years on call\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - PythonAnywhere Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nThe first weekend of October 2015 my company bought an advert during the first episode of \"\"Downton Abbey\"\" on Sunday evening. \nIt was so successful that the website went down for half an hour.\nWe wanted to look at the analytics and the data to estimate the impact.\nBut they were having a very hard weekend too: the replica of the production database we used was unreachable and the only person who knew how to fix it was on a plane.\nMonday really was a memorable day\n\nThis session is about sharing some life experience and best practices around Data Engineering.\nAttendants should have some previous understanding of data and tech in business.\nAttendants should leave with an understanding of on-call practices and with some quick win actions to take.\n\nWhat does it mean to be on call?\n\nHow do you make sure that the phone rings as little as possible?\n\nFixing versus Root Cause Analysis.\nSystems break at junctures.\nEspecially if the juncture is with a third party.\n\nWhy and when is it worth reacting to errors as soon as they happen?\n\nExternal Services.\nIncreasing Business Trust.\nAllowing others to build on solid ground.\n\n\nHow do you make sure the phone rings when it should?\n\nAlerting tools: emails, chat, specialised applications like PagerDuty, OpsGenie and Twilio\nMonitoring systems\nMonitoring data (Data Quality) as a continuous early warning system.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
