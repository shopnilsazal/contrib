description: "For 22 years, the best binary ninjas in the world have gathered at DEF CON to play the world’s most competitive Capture-the-Flag. At DEF CON 24, DARPA will challenge machines to play this game for the first time, with the winner taking home a $2 million prize. This talk will include a first public look at the machines, teams, technology, and visualization behind Cyber Grand Challenge. The technology: machines that discover bugs and build patches? We’re bringing our qualifier results to show just how real this is. The teams: we’ll talk about the finalists who prevailed to make it to the CGC final round. Visualization: the product of CTF players working with game designers, this talk will include a live interactive demo of a graphical debugger for everyone that will let an audience follow along in real time. The machines: we’re bringing high performance computing to the DEF CON stage. The event: In 2016, machines will Capture the Flag! Follow DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge on Twitter: #DARPACGC\n\nMike Walker joined DARPA as a program manager in January 2013. His research interests include machine reasoning about software in situ and the automation of application security lifecycles.\n\nPrior to joining DARPA, Mr. Walker worked in industry as a security software developer, Red Team analyst, enterprise security architect and research lab leader. As part of the Computer Science Corporation \"Strikeforce\" Red Team, Mr. Walker helped develop the HEAT Vulnerability Scanner and performed Red Team engagements. Serving as a principal at the Intrepidus Group, Mr. Walker worked on Red Teams that tested America's financial and energy infrastructure for security weaknesses. Also, on the DARPA SAFER Red Team, Mr. Walker discovered flaws in prototype communications technologies.\n\nMr. Walker has participated in various roles in numerous applied computer security competitions. He contributed challenges to DEF CON Capture the Flag (CTF) and competed on and led CTF teams at the highest levels of international competition. Mr. Walker was formerly a mentor of the Computer Security Competition Club at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST).\n\nJordan started his professional career at the University of Florida where he got to do a little bit of everything security related. His love of CTFs, however, drove him to a job at a government contractor where he honed his reverse engineering and vulnerability research skills. Now, his goal in life is to become a professional CTF e-sports caster so he founded a startup Vector 35 to try to get paid to do stuff with CTFs and gaming."
