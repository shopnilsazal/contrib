description: "Chris Sinjakli, SRE at GoCardless\n\nIf we're gonna do this SRE thing, we need to find the right people to do it.\n\nAfter a few recent discussions, it became clear just how much everyone—at large companies and small—is struggling to find those people.\n\nYou can barely get enough applicants in the door, and by the time you've run your interview process you're left making a handful of offers.\n\nHiring SREs from the outside world is a competitive, expensive game to play. So why focus so much on people outside your company? You've got potential SREs sat all around you!\n\nIn this talk, we'll set the scene with a little look at the realities of hiring SREs. We won't stay there for too long though, because that's not what's going to save us!\n\nThe bulk of the talk will be spent looking at ways to discover budding SREs in your organisation, how to nurture their interest, and how to coach them in a role that's new to them.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
