description: "Hardware Hacking: You can be a Maker by Christopher Sexton and Leah Sexton\n\nThere is something fundamentally satisfying about building things that bridge the gap between your code and the physical world. This father/daughter duo will show you how they've bridge that gap.\n\nI frequently find Rubyists that are interested in tinkering with hardware but are often intimidated by the idea. Turns out, it is so easy even a grown-up can do it. In fact it is easier than it has ever been. And the best part is, you can use little Ruby."
