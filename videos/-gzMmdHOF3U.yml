description: "Abstract: \nBeing the only person in the entire company who works the appsec program gets old. You're getting no help from anyone and no one cares about what you're doing. Are you the ONLY PERSON who actually cares about security? Are you even making a difference, or are you just counting the days until a breach? \nIf this is your appsec story, job after job, I'll cover things you can do immediately to start a culture change at your company and recruit appsec champions in this fight. Let's change your story.\n\nby Coleen Coolidge, Head of Security at Segment in San Francisco.\n\nColeen Coolidge is Head of Security at Segment in San Francisco. Previously, she was at Twilio (pre-to-post IPO) as Sr Director of Trust and Security. She's also served in security-leadership positions at more traditional, enterprise companies like First American Title and CoreLogic in Southern California. Coleen works on advancing the security culture past “just having the infrastructure-people do it” to creating a comprehensive program where everyone in the company participates to improve the company’s security posture year over year.\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
