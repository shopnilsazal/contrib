description: "\"A  robotic platform for natural and effective human-robot interaction\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - Anfiteatro 1]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nThis  talk deals  with  the usage  of  artificial  intelligent  techniques  in  humanoid  robotics. The focus is on humanâ€“robot interaction with the goal of building a robotic platform which embodiments are able to interact in natural and effective way with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions. The system is fully implemented in Python and based on the Robotic Operating System (ROS). The talk will describe the hardware and software configuration of our currently NAO based humanoid platform.  The strategy has been to use available high level Python libraries for spoken language processing, sentiment analysis,  vision,  interfacing with Artificial Intelligence applications  in   order   to   provide current edge technologies performances.   The overall system architecture is based on finite state machines nodes interacting via the ROS communication layer. \nThe main fields of applications that the platform is targeting are:\n   - Entertainment\n   - Education\n   - Field robotics\n   - Home and companion robotics\n   - Hospitality\n   - Robot Assisted Therapy (RAT)\nWe will present the latest status of the platform together with a NAO based demo.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
