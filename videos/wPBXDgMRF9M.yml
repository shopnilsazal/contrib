recordingDate: 1403543954
description: "PyData SV 2014 \nTo a lot of people, Facebook is a website for interacting with friends and family. It's also a giant treasure trove of rich, fascinating data. Facebook has made accessing large data sets easier in part by releasing open source technologies like Presto and Tornado. In this talk Jason will explain how he turns terabytes of data into compelling, interactive, data-driven applications whose purposes run the gamut from internal insights to debugging, to beautiful visualizations. He will show examples of each kind of visualization, and talk about the architecture behind each and how Python is integral to tying all the pieces together, quickly. Jason will cover several open source technologies like crossfilter.js, dc.js, d3.js and 0mq."
