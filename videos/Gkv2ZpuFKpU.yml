recordingDate: 1385420517
description: "Blake Self, Durandal & Bitemytaco: Free Anonymous Internet Using Modified Cable Modems\nUsing various modifications and techniques - it is possible to gain free and anonymous cable modem internet access. This talk will analyze and discuss the tools, techniques, and technology behind both hacking cable modems and attempting to catch the users who are hacking cable modems. Previously confidential information gained from a senior network technician at Time Warner will be disclosed in this speech. We will also talk about how these techniques have been used to keep various heavily used servers online and anonymous for over six months without detection.\n\nBlake Self is most widely known for co-authoring the first commercial encrypted instant messenger with Dr. Cyrus Peikari while at VirusMD. He has also worked as a SIPRNET Administrator, Department of Defense Red Team Analyst, and R&D at various corporations including Airscanner and Ontario Systems. He currently works as an analyst for the Healthcare and Debt Collection industries as well as doing research for SERC (https://www.serc.net).\n\nDurandal is the vice president of SOLDIERX and is most widely known for the large amounts of epic win found in his bloodstream. He is the CEO of an information security corporation, but chooses to remain anonymous due to the black hat nature of the information he will be presenting.\n\nBitemytaco is the co-owner of Surfboard Hacker (www.sbhacker.net), the best modem hacking website and forum. He is an expert on DOCSIS and Motorola cable modem modification, especially the SB5100 and SB5101. He also made possible and funded the development of the first hacked firmware for the SB5101, SBH Haxorware (by Rajkosto).\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
