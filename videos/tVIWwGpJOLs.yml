description: "Jesse 'x30n' D'Aguanno: LAN Protocol Attacks Part 1 - Arp Reloaded\nEver wanted to hijack a connection between machines on a LAN, deny service between a host you're attacking and a log server or intrusion detection system, or maybe wanted to sniff traffic on a switched network? Now you can! Er, wait... You already could with the ARP attacks we all know and love. While these network attacks are quite effective, they do have their weaknesses, as well as security controls to help prevent them. In this talk I will build on the previous research in this field and introduce new, more reliable attacks against the ARP protocol which are much less identifiable and able to protect against. \n\nJesse 'x30n' D'Aguanno is a security researcher and software engineer who has been involved in the security industry and \"underground\" for over 10 years. As a software engineer he has contributed to numerous open source and commercial projects. As a researcher, he has written and published many papers and proof of concept tools. His current research interests are primarily focused on binary reverse engineering, anti- forensics, exploit development and network attack. He is a frequent presenter at different industry conferences and events. By day he works as the Director of Professional Services and Research for Praetorian Global, a security services company in California. In his \"spare\" time, he is the team captain for Digital Revelation, a security think tank most known as the two time winners (And almost annual participants) of Defcon CTF."
