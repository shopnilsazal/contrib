title: '#HITB2017AMS D1T1 - We Broke All CSPs And You Won''t Believe What Happened - Spagnuolo & Weichselbaum'
recordingDate: 1494288037
description: "Last year we proved that the whitelist-based approach of Content Security Policy (CSP) is flawed and proposed an alternative based on ‘strict-dynamic’ in combination with nonces or hashes. This approach makes CSP radically easier to deploy and, at the same time, unleashes its full potential as an XSS mitigation mechanism.\n\nIn our academic paper (CSP Is Dead, Long Live CSP! On the Insecurity of Whitelists and the Future of Content Security Policy, ACM CCS, 2016), we demonstrated, using automatic checks, that 94.72% of all real-world policies can be trivially bypassed by an attacker with an XSS bug. Furthermore, we found that 75.81% of all policies are bypassable due to whitelists.\n\nThanks to the new ‘strict-dynamic’ approach, we were finally able to deploy an effective policy to many important Google products, such as GMail, Photos, and others. In this presentation we would like to share our experience, show examples, best practices and common pitfalls.\n\nFinally, we share how we are addressing the recent bypasses of nonce-based policies, such as nonce exfiltration/reuse techniques and dangling markup attacks.\n\n=== \n\nMichele Spagnuolo is an Information Security Engineer at Google focusing on security enhancements and mitigations for web applications. He co-authored the specification for ‘strict-dynamic’ in CSP3, serving as a strong mitigation against cross-site scripting attacks. Other works include Rosetta Flash (rosettaflash.com) and BitIodine (bitiodine.net).\n\n--- \n\nLukas Weichselbaum is an Information Security Researcher at Google focusing on security enhancements and mitigations for web applications. He co-authored the specification for ‘strict-dynamic’ in CSP3 and launched CSP-Evaluator (csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com), a tool for developers and security experts to check if a Content Security Policy serves as a strong mitigation against cross-site scripting attacks. Lukas previously worked on dynamic analysis of Android malware. He also founded Andrubis – one of the very first large scale malware analysis platforms for Android applications."
