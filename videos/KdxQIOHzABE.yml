description: 'Everybody at RubyConf is likely using Git now, but Git is capable of doing a lot of stuff. Do you know what replacements do? Have you used bundles? Do you have rerere turned on? Did I just make that last one up? Can you list out all the commits on a branch that have and have not already been cherry-picked? What is a git note? This talk will go over all of that and more, but in a classy way. If you are a regular Git user (and I know you are), I can almost guarantee that you will learn several things and can use your new moves to amaze and confuse your friends.'
