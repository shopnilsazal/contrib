title: 'Reaktor Breakpoint 2018: Sergio Benitez, A Case for Oxidation - The Rust programming language'
recordingDate: 1528989317
description: "For almost five decades, we've built core systems software in unsafe languages like C or C++. Four of these decades can be excused as no alternative existed that matched these languages in performance and control. In the last decade, however, Rust, a programming language sponsored by Mozilla Research, has emerged. Rust promises to deliver equivalent or better performance and greater productivity with guaranteed memory safety and data race freedom while allowing complete and direct control over memory.\n\nHow does Rust guarantee memory safety without a garbage collector? How does it guarantee data race freedom at all? And, how does it do all of these things while being a comfortable language to work in and write low-level software? This talk answers these questions and more. It also provides concrete, real-world examples that leverage Rust to take these promises further. These examples include Rocket, a web framework for Rust that prevents correctness and web security bugs at compile-time. All together, this talk makes a case for oxidizing software.\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018. For more information, check reaktorbreakpoint.com.\n\n---\n\nSergio Benitez\nex SpaceX, Google, Author of Rocket Web Framework for Rust\n\nSergio is a PhD student at Stanford. His research focuses on converging research in systems, formal veriÔ¨Åcation, programming languages, and security to create secure, usable, and performant systems. Before Stanford, Sergio spent time working at Google, Apple, and SpaceX where he worked on projects ranging from designing anomaly detection algorithms to tuning the performance of operating systems running on rockets and other spacecraft."
