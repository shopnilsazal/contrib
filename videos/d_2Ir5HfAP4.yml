title: 'Ruby On Rales 2013 Security is hard, but we can''t go shopping by Andre Arko'
recordingDate: 1369088878
description: "The last few months have been pretty brutal for anyone who depends on Ruby libraries in production. Ruby is really popular now, and that's exciting! But it also means that we are now square in the crosshairs of security researchers, whether whitehat, blackhat, or some other hat. Only the Ruby and Rails core teams have meaningful experience with vulnerabilites so far. It won't last. Vulnerabilities are everywhere, and handling security issues responsibly is critical if we want Ruby (and Rubyists) to stay in high demand.\n\nI'll discuss responsible disclosure as an end-user, as well as repsonsible ownership of your own code. How do you know if a bug is a security issue, and how do you report it without tipping off someone malicious? As a Rubyist, you probably have at least one library of your own. How do you handle security issues without inviting attacks on the old code? Don't let your site get hacked, or worse yet, let your project allow someone else's site to get hacked! Learn from the hard-won wisdom of the security community so that we won't repeat the mistakes of others.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGbD/"
