title: 'DEF CON 17 - Alek Amrani - Session Donation'
recordingDate: 1384992732
description: "Session Donation\nAlek Amrani\n\nIt's easier to give away than it is to take. Apply that theory to Session Hijacking, and enter Session Donation. \n\nSession Donation is a computer session attack that attempts to gain information by taking session hijacking in an entirely new direction. Session Donation is an interesting new spin on an old attack that is much harder to prevent than it's predecessor, and equally as dangerous.\n\nAlek Amrani is currently an Information Security Programmer for the Information Security Office at the University of Texas at Austin where he is also pursuing a degree in Computer Science. He's interested in all areas of security from physical to computational, and is also the vice-president of the Longhorn LockPicking Club. Generally described by his friends as 'paranoid', Alek enjoys introducing himself as people he's not, looking over his shoulder, taking different routes home, and creating new passwords in his spare time.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
