recordingDate: 1384990311
description: "Introduction to WiMAX Hacking\nGoldy\nPierce\n\nWiMAX is a new high speed, 802.16e, wide area broadband service that promises to replace 3G high speed networks. It is only being offered in a few cities across the country, but by 2012 it is estimated that it will be nation wide. Over the last decade, hackers have explored and demonstrated weaknesses in the security of WiFi, pushing the industry to come up with better security practices. In this talk, we intend to make it clear what WiMAX is, what is being done to protect the existing deployed WiMAX networks, and different ways to get anonymous Internet anywhere WiMAX is being served.\n\nGoldy Co-author of JanusVM (Virtual Machine), JanusPA (Privacy Adapter), Tor VM, independent security researcher, Security Director of Xerobank, and long time wireless enthusiast...also from Portland, OR. Despite spending the last two years working on side-channel attacks against anonymity networks, he has returned to his roots to explore and exploit wireless yet again.\nPierce A member of SophSec research, and a independent computer security researcher from Portland, OR. He has previously spoken at Defcon about wireless security.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
