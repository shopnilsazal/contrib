title: '#HITB2017AMS D2T2 - The Best Laid Schemes: Attacking URL Schemes - Yu Hong'
recordingDate: 1494807831
description: "GET operations are usually inevitable in most web exploits and the replacement of schemes in a target URL could result in different outcomes for an attacker.\n\nThis presentation discusses an attack route via URL schemes. We will first briefly cover the background of URL and URI schemes, their inherent similarities and differences. We then move on to see how we can use and abuse URL schemes to extend attack surfaces and overcome limitations in current SSRF and XXE attack methods.\n\nAdditionally we will introduce the URL scheme attack surfaces exposed via different browsers on various platforms and analyze client vulnerabilities that can result from rendering these URL schemes.  We will also would disclose a brand new 0day in Mozilla Firefoxâ€™s web browser that results in arbitrary code execution.\n\n=== \n\nYu Hong is an independent security researcher with more than 7 years of experience in web security research and web application penetration testing, he has discovered and reported several vulnerabilities and received acknowledgement for his contributions from various companies including Apple, Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba and more. Yu is also familiar with APT attacks and has traced lots of real-world attacks."
