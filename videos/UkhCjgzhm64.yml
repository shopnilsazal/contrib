recordingDate: 1382326280
description: "core.typed is a gradual type system for Clojure. With annotations, it can type check normal Clojure code and help document subtle type invariants. This talk is an overview of core.typed, including its influences, rationale, design goals and tradeoffs. Assumes some experience with Clojure, does not assume core.typed experience. Intended to precede the core.typed workshop.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference and YOW! Lambda Jam, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au and http://www.lambdajam.com.au"
