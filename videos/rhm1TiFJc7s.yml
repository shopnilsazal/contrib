title: '#HITB2017AMS D2T2 - Chasing Cars: Keyless Entry System Attacks - Yingtao Zeng, Qing Yang and Jun Li'
recordingDate: 1494720403
description: "Many of today’s cars have upgraded from the old RKE (remote keyless entry) keyfob to PKE (passive keyless entry) system making it more convenient for end users. A car equipped with the PKE system allows the driver to unlock the car by being in proximity of the vehicle or by touching the handle of the door while in possession of the keyfob.  In addition, PKE equipped vehicles can be started and driven without the driver inserting the key into the keyhole manually. (For a better understanding of PKE systems, have a read through these papers: http://www.nxp.com/documents/leaflet/75017275.pdf and https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/332.pdf)\n\nPKE systems use both low frequency and high frequency radio links to perform two-way authentication. We have implemented a  relay attack using two very low cost radios and have extended the range further than any previous research. We have already extended the attack range to a few hundred meters  and can unlock your car in the parking lot while your keyfob is your pocket on the top floor of your office building, or drive your car away while you are in the mall. We are currently exploring the ability to further extend this attack by relaying the signals across the Internet.\n\nOur talk will cover the methodology we used in developing the attack, the hardware we built and code we wrote for it.\n\n=== \n\nYingtao Zeng is a Security researcher at UnicornTeam in the largest Chinese security company Qihoo360. He is mainly focused on the security of Internet of things, car remote control systems and automotive radar safety research. He has found vulnerabilities in a variety of automobile manufacturers including Buick, Volvo, Chevrolet, Toyota, Nissan, BYD and more. He was a speaker at the DEFCON CarHacking Village.\n\n--- \n\nQing Yang is the founder and director of Radio Security Research Department and UnicornTeam in Qihoo360. He had spoken at security conferences like DEFCON, CanSecWest, POC, Ruxcon etc. His team members have presented their research at Blackhat USA&EUROPE,DEFCON,HITB many times. He has rich experiences in wireless and hardware security area, including WiFi penetration testing, cellular network interception, IC card cracking etc. His interests also cover embedded system hacking, firmware reversing, automotive security, and software radio.\n\n--- \n\nJun Li is a senior security researcher at UnicornTeam,Qihoo360,He is the founder of DEFCON Group 010. He had spoken at conferences like DEFCON, HITB, KCon, Syscan360, ISC etc. His research interests include IoT security, connected car security.Jun Li, along with his colleagues, have previously found several automobile vulnerabilities in Volvo，BMW，Audi，Mercedes Benz and BYD."
