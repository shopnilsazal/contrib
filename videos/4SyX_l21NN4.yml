description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://gsec.hitb.org/materials/sg2015/\n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\nIPv6 provides a rich complexity of extension headers and options and a massive address space.\n\nThis talk shows how …\n\n– this can be exploited to perform any kind of attack that are not detected by the major IDS/IPS systems on the market\n– source blocking can be circumvented\n– data exfiltration can be performed\n– and how these attacks can be mitigated – which is difficult.\n\nA new tool called fragrouter6 will be released at the conference (will be part of the thc-ipv6 package) which can be used to transform any packets (e.g. nmap or metasploit packets) to bypass IDS/IPS.\n\nABOUT MARC HEUSE\n\nMarc “van Hauser” Heuse is the founder of The Hacker’s Choice (www.thc.org) and author of the thc-ipv6 IPv6 attack suite.\n\nSince 2006 he researches IPv6 for security issues and reports vulnerabilities for all major OS on a regular basis. He also spoke at numerous conferences about his findings, e.g. CansecWest, Pacsec, Hack-in-the-Box, CCC Congress, etc. He is also known for the famous tools hydra, amap and THC-Scan among others.\n\nMarc is an independent security researcher and consultant."
