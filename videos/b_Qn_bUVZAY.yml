You can already use Kubernetes as the common platform for your entire lifecycle, but wouldnâ€™t it be cool to use one tool to manage it? Spinnaker is a multi-cloud CI/CD platform that works well with Kubernetes on many cloud providers. In this talk we will discuss how to turn your workstation running minikube into another cloud provider in your cloud based production Spinnaker and add it to your CI/CD pipeline.\n\nAbout Sean Korten\nSean is a Lead Platform/DevOps Engineer with Kenzan, a professional services company that provides customized end-to-end solutions to a diverse group of clients.
