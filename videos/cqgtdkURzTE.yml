description: "Cryptography is a complex and confusing subject. In this talk you will learn about the core components of cryptography used in software development: securing data with encryption, ensuring data integrity with hashes and digital signatures, and protecting passwords with key derivation functions. While learning how to use these components, you will also learn the best practices that drive strong cryptography. This talk wonâ€™t make you a cryptography expert but it will give you the knowledge necessary to use cryptography properly. No prior knowledge of cryptography is required for this presentation.\n\nEVENT:\n\nDutch PHP Conference in 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAdam Englander\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcjJ19geKmA"
