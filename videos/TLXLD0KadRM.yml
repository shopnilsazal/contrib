description: "by Robert Kaiser\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nWith Mozilla shutting down its Persona web login service in late 2016, apretty decent solution for logging into small websites became unavailable. Theproblem that Persona set out to solve is not gone, we still need solutions tolog into all kinds of sites without a few central and big players analyzingall data about when and where we log in. I ran into that issue for my sites[as documented in myblog](https://home.kairo.at/blog/2016-10/the_neverending_question_of_login_system)\\- this talk will discuss the problem itself and my solution to it. This mayinclude opening up some source code to the public!\n\n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 16:00:00"
