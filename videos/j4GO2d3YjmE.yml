description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nThe Route To Rootless Containers - Ed King, Pivotal & Julz Friedman, IBM (Any Skill Level)\n\nRootless containers are a new and exciting development in the container community, offering the ability to create and manage containers as a completely unprivileged, non-root user. This is appealing both in terms of security, as well as in making container-based workloads accessible to a much wider audience. During this presentation, Julz and Ed will share their learnings from the journey to adopting rootless containers in production for a large multi-tenant PaaS (Cloud Foundry). The talk contains a technical overview of rootless containers - what they are, how they work and how to enable them in runC as well as a discussion of the limitations of rootless containers and how we overcame those limitations. If youâ€™re interested in using rootless containers in production, this talk is for you!\n\nAbout Ed\nEd is a Systems Engineer currently working on the Cloud Foundry Garden project. He has spoken at CFSummit Santa Clara 2016.\n\nAbout Julian\nJulian Friedman (julz) is an IBMer and the project lead for Cloud Foundy's low-level container engine (\"\"Garden\"\") and the Application Autoscaler component. Over a long career he has worked on early cloud environments, Map/Reduce, performance optimisation for AI systems and, of course, most currently and importantly, building container engines for fantastic multi-tenant platforms as a service. If you have several free hours and enjoy the sound of a rant delivered in a British accent, ask him whether he thinks pushing mongodb to a cloud platform is a good idea."
