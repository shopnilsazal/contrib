description: "Succeeding in the games industry often depends on how fast one is able to create innovative game concepts, choose the best ones, and transform them into optimal production plans. The difference between success and failure is defined by using the right mindset and methodologies. \"\nMetrics and monetization have a bad reputation, mostly because they hung out with the wrong crowd. Game Designer Laralyn McWilliams started hearing about both concepts not from their roots in MMOs but as a part of the development philosophy of specific social game companies that were also notorious for a decision-making process that didn't include designers. In fact, metrics provide useful tools for designers that become a part of the toolbox for creating great games that players love. This 2012 talk from designer Laralyn McWilliams is intended both to educate designers and to arm them for debates with marketing, business development, product managers and execs about design choices.\"\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
