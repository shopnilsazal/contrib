title: 'Jruby Polyglot Heaven by Thomas E Enebo and Charles Oliver Nutter'
recordingDate: 1323720881
description: 'JRuby is a top-notch Ruby implementation. It''s also your gateway to polyglot heaven. Ruby can do anything, but it''s not always the best tool for the job. With JRuby, you can take advantage of other JVM languages. Build part of your application in Clojure, taking advantage of its immutability and transactional guarantees. Build another part in Scala, leveraging its flexible static type system and actor libraries like Akka. Use JavaScript via Rhino to test pages or run JS on the server alongside Rails. Use Mirah to build fast-as-Java algorithms in a Rubilicious syntax. The JVM is a haven for polyglots, and JRuby''s your ticket to ride.'
