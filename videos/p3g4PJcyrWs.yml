description: "Droidcon Paris 2014\nCédric Pointel & Mathieu Hausherr, Octo Technology\n\nReady to develop your first Google Glass app? I guess that you will be asking yourself the same questions we had :\n\n• How to sign in your users without keyboard?\n• How to scan or detect an object just by looking at it?\n• How to provide an intuitive and interactive UX?\n• How to deal with your IT system and share information between users?\n\nWe will show you which dependencies to add to your build.gradle to satisfy your user's wildest dreams and provide them a full compatible app for connected glasses.\n\nYou're not ready? Don't panic, our ideas will convince you to buy glasses. And with our code you will discover that a Google Glass app is nothing else but an Android App."
