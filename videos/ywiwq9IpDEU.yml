description: "RubyConf 2017: That time I used Ruby to crack my Reddit password by Haseeb Qureshi\n\nI lost my password. So I used Ruby to crack it, kinda. I will re-enact the story live in front of a group of strangers.\n\nI'm going to be honest, this is a weird and fairly embarrassing story. You probably shouldn't come see it.\n\nYou know what, forget I even said anything."
