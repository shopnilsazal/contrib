description: 'Secure multiparty computation is about jointly computing a function while keeping each parties inputs secret.  This comes off as an esoteric area of cryptography, but the goal of this talk is to introduce you to the core concepts through a history of the topic.  I will conclude by demoing an implementation of an example protocol I implemented.'
