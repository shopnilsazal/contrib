description: "PyData Chicago 2016\n\nGithub: https://github.com/parsing-science/pymc3_quickstart_guide\n\nPyMC3 is a powerful relatively new library for probabilistic models. The developers have given multiple talks describing probabilistic models, Bayesian statistics, and the features of the library. This tutorial aims to complement these talks by providing a practical guide to using PyMC3 with step-by-step implementations of some basic models and some issues you might encounter."
