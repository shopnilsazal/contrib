description: "Mechanical Engineering for Noobs\nMachinist\n\n\"Art to Part - Essential Mechanical Engineering skills for Hackers\" Have you ever found yourself in need to hack something in the physical world, like making an electronics enclosure or a 3D printed widget? Well you're in luck, because I'm going to show you how to take a vague idea in your head, add dimension and tolerance in virtual 3D space, and output to the real world.\n\nHave a 3D printer sitting on your desk, begging to extrude custom trinkets, but are confined to downloading pre-made models of dog poop from Thingiverse? We will cover some basic 3D modeling tools and software that everyone should have in their box, as well as some considerations for 3D printing.\n\n3D scanning is also an interesting way to make your ideas real, and I'll be giving a rundown on my favorite software and hardware to do just that."
