description: "Managing Growing Pains: Thinking Big While Being Small by Joe Arnold\n\nThis talk is for anyone who's had to promise new features to a client when they weren't actually sure how they'd deliver on the promise.\n\nWe all have big visions and big ideas, but our teams and abilities are finite resources. We'll talk about how to manage expectations, growth, technical debt and delivery (and still be able to sleep at night despite that last wonky commit). We'll talk about the never-ending product roadmap, product reality and how what we create falls somewhere in between.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/JeLQ/"
