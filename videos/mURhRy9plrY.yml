recordingDate: 1431106193
description: "by Raimonds Simanovskis\n\nTypical Rails applications have database schemas that are designed for on-line transaction processing. But when the data volumes grow then they are not well suited for effective data analysis. You probably need a data warehouse and specialized data analysis tools for that. This presentation will cover * an introduction to a data warehouse and multi-dimensional schema design, * comparison of traditional and analytical databases, * extraction, transformation and load (ETL) of data, * On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) tools, Mondrian OLAP engine in particular and how to use it from Ruby."
