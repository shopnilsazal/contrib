description: "Go is a simple language. Sometimes, that simplicity means that common, peripheral tasks are deferred to other tools to solve. This talk will explore some of the questions that we've asked ourselves at SoundCloud about writing, building, deploying, running, and maintaining Go code in a production environment, focusing on the areas where the Go ecosystem doesn't offer clear guidance. We also hope to provide at least a few answers.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0A/"
