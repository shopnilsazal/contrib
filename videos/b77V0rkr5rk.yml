description: "How are Method Calls Formed? by Aaron Patterson\n\nIn this presentation we're going to study how method calls are executed. We'll go from bytecode created by Ruby's Virtual Machine down to the C code where the methods actually get executed.\n\nAfter we've learned about how Ruby executes methods today, we'll dive in to optimizations we can make on method dispatch including various types of inline method caching. You should leave with a better understanding of Ruby's VM internals as well as ways to analyze and optimize your own code. Also the presentation will have really great transitions in Keynote."
