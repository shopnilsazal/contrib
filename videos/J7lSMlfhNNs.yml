recordingDate: 1393403870
description: "Robert Windmann- The Defcon Proxy Server\nR will give an overview of the Defcon Proxy Server - what it is, how it came to be, and how to access and use it. Don't want your boss to know where you're surfing to on his dime? Would you like to anonymously view your artwork after the fact? If this is you, don't miss this informational talk. It will cover new features and access policies.\n\nR started out in life as a BBS operator in 1989. After setting up Unix boxes to provide Usenet and Email via UUCP for his customers, he gave out shell accounts on the same machines - and after cleaning up that mess, he was a Security Expert! He also authored the first Windows based email application and roaming code for American Mobile Satellite Corporation and the Trimble C/GPS transceiver, and was head of Network Security for Telegroup, Inc. \n\nDEF CON 7.0 was held July 9-11th, 1999, in Las Vegas Nevada USA"
