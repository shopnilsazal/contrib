description: "As part of GDC 2015's Microtalks, Insomniac's Lisa Brown discusses how her team executed a new philosophy. As she suggests, if you can put yourself in a consistent position of having performance pressure to a trusted audience, that anxiety can be leveraged as a tool to shape your design process and make you more efficient.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
