description: "Trade School is a self-organized learning model that runs on barter. No one has ever been paid to organize a Trade School or teach a class there, but the model is working in 18 cities around the world. How does barter build community? This is the story of Trade School, started by three friends from OurGoods.org in NYC in 2010, and now running in Barcelona, Cologne, Milan, Singapore, London, Cardiff, Manila, Quito, Glasgow, Bangkok, Purchase, Paris, and new cities each month. Trade School is an all-volunteer led organization, for now.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGcm/"
