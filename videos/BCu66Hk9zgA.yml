description: "gitDigger: Creating useful wordlists from public GitHub repositories \nJAIME FILSON (WIK) \nROB FULLER (MUBIX)\n\nThis presentation intends to cover the thought process and logistics behind building a better wordlist using github public repositories as its source. With an estimated 2,000,000 github projects to date, how would one store that amount of data? Would you even want or need to? After downloading approximately 500,000 repositories, storing 6TB on multiple usb drives; this will be a story of one computer, bandwidth, basic python and how a small idea quickly got out of hand.\n\nJaime Filson (WiK) ell, WiK's just zis guy. He enjoys long walks on the beach while his computer equipment is busy fuzzing software, cracking passwords, or spidering the internet. \nRob Fuller (Mubix) is a Senior Red Teamer. His professional experience start from his time on active duty as United States Marine. He has worked with devices and software that run gambit in the security realm. He has a few certifications that haven't expired yet, but the titles that he holds above the rest is father, husband, and United States Marine.\n\nMaterials: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/WiK-Mubix/DEFCON-21-WiK-Mubix-gitDigger.pdf"
