description: "Ana Balica - Demystifying Mixins with Django\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nMixins are a great way to keep an application decoupled. This talk is\nabout building mixins and dissecting what's behing the mixin \"magic\"\nand that, in fact, there is no magic involved at all. The main focus\nwill be on Django framework while digging into mixins. When using\nDjango class-based views, mixins feel very natural.\n\n**Goal**: by the end of this talk, every developer should be confident\nabout creating his or her own custom mixins.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n - basic understanding of OOP principles and their application in Python\n - Django web framework\n\nGenerally mixins in Python are pretty straight-forward, easy to create\nand use. Nevertheless a lot of developers stay away from them. I think\nattendees of this talk will be interested to learn that mixins are not\nthat complex and their benefit is tremendous."
