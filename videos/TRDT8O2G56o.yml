description: "iOS Application Defense - iMAS - Gregg Ganley\n\niOS application security can be *much* stronger and easy for developers to find, understand and use.  iMAS (iOS Mobile Application Security) - is a secure, open source  iOS application framework research project focused on reducing iOS application vulnerabilities and information loss.  Today, iOS meets the enterprise security needs of customers, however many security experts cite critical vulnerabilities and have demonstrated exploits, which in turn pushes enterprises to augment iOS deployments with commercial solutions.  \n\nThe iMAS intent is to protect iOS applications and data beyond the Apple provided security model and reduce the adversary's ability and efficiency to perform recon, exploitation, control and execution on iOS mobile applications.  iMAS has released five security controls (researching many more)  for developers to download and use within iOS applications.  This talk will walk through various iOS application vulnerabilities, iMAS security controls, OWASP Mobile top10 and CWE vulnerabilities addressed, and demonstrate the iMAS App Password control integrated into an application.\n\n\nSpeaker\n\nGregg Ganley\nPrincipal Investigator iOS Security Research, MITRE Corp\n\n23+ software development and management experience Education: MSCS, BSEE.
