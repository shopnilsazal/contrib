description: "RubyConf 2016 - Metaprogramming? Not good enough! by Justin Weiss\n\nIf you know how to metaprogram in Ruby, you can create methods and objects on the fly, build Domain Specific Languages, or just save yourself a lot of typing. But can you change how methods are dispatched? Can you decide that the normal inheritance rules don't apply to some object?\n\nIn order to change those core parts of the language, there can't be much difference between how a language is implemented and how it's used. In this talk, you'll make that difference smaller, building a totally extensible object model on top of Ruby, using less than a dozen new classes and methods."
