recordingDate: 1384985425
description: "three point Oh.\nJohnny Long Co-Pilot, Hackers For Charity, Inc\n\nFrom scrubby C64 pirate to professional hacker to reluctant \"Internet rockstar\", the past five years of Johnny's journey have been interesting. The last few months, however, have been straight-up bizarre.\n\nWhile many strain to maintain and others scrape and scratch at the ladder, Johnny's jumped off the top rung.\n\nThis is a story of what it takes to make it in this industry, and what the view's like from the top.\n\nThis is a story about how utterly teh suck the view from the top really is and why you might want to just jump off now before it's too late.\n\nThis is the story of a rise and fall and the crossover cable those terms require.\n\nThis is a story that's relevant if you're in for the long haul.\n\nThis is Johnny's story, as only Johnny can tell it.\n\nWhich means it might be funny.\n\nJohnny Long Christian. Hacker. Pirate. Ninja. Ladder Jumper. http://www.hackersforcharity.org. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
