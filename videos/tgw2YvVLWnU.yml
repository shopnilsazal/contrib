description: "\"Python on Windows, Like a Boss\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - Arengo]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nHistorically, Python coding on Windows has been kind of troublesome, but not anymore. Since a couple of years ago it is possible write awesome quality Python code with Visual Studio. This is good news for Python developers of all levels, because Visual Studio offers and incredible set of tools to enhance all the stages of product development: from managing virtual environments and handling package management, to writing and refactoring code, up to testing & debugging - all of that for free. In this talk I will demo how you can use Visual Studio to boost your Python development on Windows.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
