description: 'You Thought What?!  The Promise of Real-Time Brain Decoding: What can faster machine learning and new model-based approaches tell us about what someone is really thinking?  Recently, Intel joined up with some of the pioneers of brain decoding to understand exactly that.  Using functional MRI as our microscope, we began analyzing large amounts of high-dimensional 4-D image data to uncover brain networks that support cognitive processes.  But existing image preprocessing, feature selection, and classification techniques are too slow and inaccurate to facilitate the most exciting breakthroughs.   In this talk, we’ll discuss the promise of accurate real-time brain decoding and the computational headwinds.  And we’ll look at some of the approaches to algorithms and optimization that Intel Labs and its partners are taking to reduce the barriers.'
