description: "Steve Schear - GNU Radio\nWireless communication devices have traditionally been exclusively hardware in nature. Software has augmented and is now replacing basic functional elements of radio systems. The conclusion of this process is a radio where almost all functions are performed by software. GNU Radio is a collection of software that when combined with minimal hardware, allows the construction of radios where the actual waveforms transmitted and received are defined by software. What this means is that it turns the digital modulation schemes used in today's high performance wireless devices into software problems.\n\nSteve Schear is the CEO of Lamarr Labs. He has led development of commercial spread spectrum radios and held engineering, business development and marketing positions at TRW, Citicorp, Cylink, Com21, Mojo Nation and Counterpane Internet Security. Steve is currently the project administrator of GNURadio."
