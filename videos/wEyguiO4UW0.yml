description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nDecember, 19 2007\r\n\r\nThe DNA in our cells consists of not only the well-known 46\r\nchromosomes currently receiving such avid attention from specialists\r\nin sequencing technology, but also a large number of copies of a\r\nrelatively tiny, circular DNA molecule inside the &quot;powerhouse of the\r\ncell,&quot; the mitochondrion. Among other things, mitochondria perform\r\nthe chemistry of breathing - they extract energy from nutrients by\r\nexquisitely regulated chemical reactions that consume oxygen and\r\ncreate CO2. This vital function depends on the 13 proteins encoded by\r\nthe mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), as well as on hundreds of proteins\r\nthat are encoded in our more famous genome and imported across the\r\nmitochondrial surface after construction in the body of the cell. The\r\nmtDNA accumulates mutant, non-functional variants far faster than our\r\nmain genome, so 20 years ago scientists began looking at the idea of\r\nputting copies of the 13 genes of interest into the nucleus after\r\nmaking modifications that would cause them to be processed by the\r\nsame \"protein import\" machinery that processes the mitochondrion's\r\nmany other proteins, thus making the mtDNA itself superfluous and\r\nmutations in it harmless. I will discuss this concept in detail in my\r\ntalk. Progress has been very erratic in the meantime but is now very\r\nrapid, partly because of Methuselah Foundation-funded research.\r\nHowever, this approach may still prove impossible, so many other,\r\nostensibly simpler ideas - some more promising than others - have\r\nbeen proposed, and I will describe some of these too.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Dr Aubrey de Grey\r\nAubrey de Grey is a biomedical gerontologist based in Cambridge, UK,\r\nand is the Chairman and Chief Science Officer of the Methuselah\r\nFoundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit charity dedicated to combating the\r\naging process.  He is also Editor-in-Chief of \"Rejuvenation Research\",\r\nthe world's only peer-reviewed journal focused on intervention in\r\naging.  His research interests encompass the etiology of all the\r\naccumulating and eventually pathogenic molecular and cellular\r\nside-effects of metabolism (\"damage\") that constitute mammalian aging\r\nand the design of interventions to repair and/or obviate that damage.\r\nHe has developed a possibly comprehensive plan for such repair, termed\r\nStrategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS), which breaks the\r\naging problem down into seven major classes of damage and identifies\r\ndetailed approaches to addressing each one. A key aspect of SENS is\r\nthat it can potentially extend healthy lifespan without limit, even\r\nthough these repair processes will never be perfect, as the repair only\r\nneeds to approach perfection rapidly enough to keep the overall level\r\nof damage below pathogenic levels.  de Grey has termed this required\r\nrate of improvement of repair therapies \"longevity escape velocity\"."
