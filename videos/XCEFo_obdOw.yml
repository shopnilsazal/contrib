Additionally, Python developers and data scientists often interact with systems that are fully outside of PyData land, such as relational databases. Blaze seeks to provide a uniform interface for interacting with these systems while maintaining compatibility and the ability to interact with systems that data scientists know and love such as pandas. We first give a high-level overview of blaze and how it works then show how one can use blaze to interact with a system that up to now has been difficult to interact with outside of dreaded string programming."
