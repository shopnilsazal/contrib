title: 'GoGaRuCo 2012 - Linguistic Potluck: Crowdsourcing Localization in Rails by Heather Rivers'
recordingDate: 1349208507
description: 'Some of the most interesting challenges programmers face today are found at the intersection of natural and computer languages. Natural languages don''t have documented source code, well-defined APIs or stable release versions. There is no spec (unless it''s French), and even native speakers of the same dialects disagree all the time. How, then, can you internationalize a web application without introducing significant overhead to your development process? This talk will explore some practical strategies for maintaining speed, flexibility, quality, and focus by letting your users handle localization for you.'
