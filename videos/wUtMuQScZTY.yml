description: "PyData NYC 2015\n\nPython offers excellent tools for quickly creating high quality interactive visualization applications. Enaml is the python framework that allows easily create dynamic UI's. VTK is best open source framework for 3D visualization, and Matplotlib is one of the best python 2D plotting packages. This tutorial will show how to combine the three frameworks to create highly interactive visualizations.\n\nPython offers excellent resources and frameworks for building highly interactive and high quality application easily and quickly. In financial industry quality and speed is the major factor and often deciding one what tools and frameworks one should use. For that reason I decided to use Enaml, VTK and Matplotlib. Enaml is a great framework that is build on top of python that allows quickly and easily create dynamic UI's - currently Enaml is using QT as backend and offers high quality widgets. VTK is a C++ frameworks for interactive 3D visualizations that has python bindings. Matplotlib on the other hand offers one of the best quality 2D plots in python world. This tutorial will show how to combine Enaml with VTK and embedded Matplotlib to visualize data provided as Pandas DataFrame.\n\nSlides available here: https://github.com/viz4biz/PyDataNYC2015"
