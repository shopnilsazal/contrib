description: "Improving Design One Word at a Time\nBoris Litvinsky, Software Engineer @ Wix\n\nAs developers, we all appreciate readable code. Yet, we tend to neglect the one thing that makes it so - naming. This negligence however, tends to impact our code in far greater capacity than we realize. In fact, it threatens the one thing we care about the most - software design. In this talk weâ€™ll rediscover the importance of naming, explore the anatomy of bad name and see what makes a good one.\n\nJoin us on meetup.com: https://www.meetup.com/Kyiv-ReactJS-Meetup/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/reactkyiv\nTelegram chat: https://telegram.me/reactkyiv"
