description: "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nDeep learning is hot and happening, also in the medical field, however implementation is slow. Why is that? How do you approach such problems and how to make this a success? Where do you get the privacy-sensitive data from? Do pre-trained networks work? Can we make it scalable in the cloud? I will address these issues with a case study: segmentation of 4D heart MRI for heart function analysis.\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
