description: 'We use encryption every day, from SSL to SSH to passing notes to your crush during Social Studies class. But how does it actually work? I''ll avoid most of the math but cover the concepts of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption, including hashing and signing. I''ll also show how to use OpenSSL from inside ruby and show off the idkfa gem, a library to securely store sensitive information into your code repositories.'
