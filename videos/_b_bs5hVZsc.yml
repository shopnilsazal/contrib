description: 'Former White House OSTP staffer Mark DeLoura explains the thesis of his GDC 2015 talk as follows: "Let''s unshackle games from our expectations of what they have to be or not be. Let''s harness their unique features to help teach our children complex subjects, to motivate each other to become healthier, and to conduct scientific research collectively. Games are capable of so much. Don''t we owe it to the art form to explore all its possibilities fully? How is your government exploring games as a form of media, and how can you get involved to shape that future?"'
