description: "Description\nAfter using what was your favorite programming language for many years, you might want or be required to switch to another one. Based on GitHub repositories, we are able to build a transition matrix after solving the flow optimization problem. The results reflect the history of programming language competition in the open source world.\n\nAbstract\nAnalyzing GitHub, how developers change programming languages over time\nHave you ever been struggling with an nth obscure project, thinking : \"I could do the job with this language but why not switch to another one which would be more enjoyable to work with\" ? In his awesome blog post : The eigenvector of \"Why we moved from language X to language Y\", Erik Bernhardsson generated an N*N contingency table of all Google queries related to changing languages. However, when I read it, I couldn't help wondering what the proportion of people who effectively switched is. Thus, it has become engaging to deepen this idea and see how the popularity of languages changes among GitHub users.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
