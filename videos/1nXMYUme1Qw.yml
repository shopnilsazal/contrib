title: 'Droidcon Italy 2017 // Testing Android apps based on Dagger and RxJava - Fabio Collini'
recordingDate: 1493891444
description: "In this talk, you will learn:\n\n- how to take advantage of Mockito and other libraries to write good JVM and Espresso tests\n\n- how to use DaggerMock (an open source library available on github https://github.com/fabioCollini/DaggerMock) to avoid boilerplate code in tests\n\n- how to test asynchronous RxJava code using a JVM test\n\nWriting reliable tests is not easy for many reasons, especially when asynchronous code is involved. Some libraries can be used to create a testable architecture (for example Dagger and RxJava) and to simplify testing (Mockito, AssertJ and DaggerMock). In this talk weâ€™ll see how to write JVM and Espresso tests with particular attention on how to replace real objects with mocks and how to test asynchronous RxJava code."
