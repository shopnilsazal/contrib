description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nBeyond OpenTracing - Allison Richardet, Asteris, LLC (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nA cluster is a busy place, and lots can happen. Microservices, containers, polygot persistence, schedulers, and so on have enabled organizations to rapidly deploy a variety of applications. We can get up and running quickly, but then progress halts if we canâ€™t understand our system. In order to keep moving forward, we need to enforce structure in the right places, while not constraining the benefits of microservices. Just as event sourcing can help us structure communication among services, an evolvable grammar can structure our measurements to enable powerful insights and analytics. This grammar can help us increase cardinality in our logging and allow more tools to provide insight into what is going on. In this talk, we will walk through how to use logging, OpenTracing, and grammar to improve event collection for later analysis.\n\n\"About Allison\nAllison Richardet is an engineer for Asteris in Saint Louis, MO. She began her career doing Ada and C++ for flight systems and decided she needed more RAM, so she moved to the cloud. She currently develops in Go, Bash, and YAML and helps companies move from on-prem to Kubernetes.\""
