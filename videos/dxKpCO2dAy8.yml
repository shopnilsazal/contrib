description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nA Hackers Guide to Kubernetes and the Cloud - Rory McCune, NCC Group PLC (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nAs Kubernetes increases in adoption it is inevitable that more clusters will come under attack by people wanting to compromise specific applications or just people looking to get access to resources for things like crypto-coin mining. The goal of this talk is to take an attackers perspective on typical cloud-based Kubernetes deployments, examine how attackers will find and compromise clusters and the applications running on them and suggest practical ways to improve the security of your cluster. This talk will draw on the presenters long experience of offensive security to provide an attacker's eye view of the challenges of running production Kubernetes clusers in cloud-facing environments.\n\nAbout Rory\nRory has worked in the Information and IT Security arena for the last 17 years in a variety of roles, from financial services, to running a small testing company, to working for large companies as a consultant. These days he spends most of his work time on application, cloud and container security. He's is an active contributor to the container security world, helping with the CIS Docker and Kubernetes guides and working on a Kubernetes Security Scanner. He has presented on application, container and general IT Security topics at a wide range of conferences from OWASP AppsecEU, to all 5 UK BSides conferences (Videos of some talks can be seen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn190b4EJWk&list=PLKDRii1YwXnKG5PiY9zx3g5dJ2zOTJ4Al here) When he’s not working he can generally be found out and about enjoying the scenery in the highlands of Scotland, when the midgies aren’t biting!"
