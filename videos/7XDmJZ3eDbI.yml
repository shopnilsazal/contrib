description: "Do you ever get distracted by a persistent bug in production while hurtling towards the ground at 122 mph?\n\nFind it easy to think about CSS while sweating through an intense vinyasa flow yoga class?\n\nNo?\n\nMe neither.\n\nAnd that's a really good thing.\n\nPhysical activities that demand our full attention allow us to enter a heightened mental state I call \"Being Present\". For me, the activity is surfing.\n\nTake a seat in the sand, slather on the sunscreen, and I will tell tales of the mystical art of wave riding. My best days of work alway begins with a trip to the beach.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGi0/"
