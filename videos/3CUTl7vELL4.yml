description: "by Barrett Clark\n\nRails and the ActiveRecord gem are really handy tools to get work done, and do it quickly. They aren't a silver bullet, though. Sometimes the database is the best place to run a complicated query. Especially when you have big transactional or time-series data. Databases are also incredibly powerful, and can do remarkable things at scale. Why not take advantage of that power?\n\nThis talk will discuss some of the things that you can do with PostgreSQL that will both blow your mind and also help you transform data into knowledge. Let's have some fun playing with data together!"
