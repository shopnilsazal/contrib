description: "Gift Wrap Your Code with Webpack by Jeremy Lund\n\nWhile there have been JavaScript module loaders available for some time now, none of them are quite like Webpack. I will talk about what Webpack is, how it can help you in your web projects, and demonstrate all of the powerful ways you can package your code for the front end using Webpack. Finally, Iâ€™ll demonstrate some ways to consume third-party modules using Webpack.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GV6y/"
