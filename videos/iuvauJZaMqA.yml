description: "Twitter's Summingbird library allows developers and data scientists to build massive streaming MapReduce pipelines without worrying about the usual mess of systems issues that come with realtime systems at scale. This talk will discuss the development of Summingbird's hybrid Batch and Realtime operating mode, the power of clean, mathematical abstractions and the massive creative leverage that functional design constraints can give to a project.\n\nThe talk will also discuss some of the applications for these technologies currently being used at Twitter.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG6s/"
