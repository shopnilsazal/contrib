recordingDate: 1506101173
description: "Venkatesh is a senior data scientist at PayPal where he is working on building state-of-the-art tools for payment fraud detection. He has over 20+ years experience in designing, developing and leading teams to build scalable server side software. In addition to being an expert in big-data technologies, Venkatesh holds a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science with specialization in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and had worked on various problems in the areas of Anti-Spam, Phishing Detection, and Face Recognition.\n\nLarge Scale Graph Processing & Machine Learning Algorithms for Payment Fraud Prevention:\nPayPal is at the forefront of applying large scale graph processing and machine learning algorithms to keep fraudsters at bay. In this talk, I’ll present how advanced graph processing and machine learning algorithms such as Deep Learning and Gradient Boosting are applied at PayPal for fraud prevention. I’ll elaborate on specific challenges in applying large scale graph processing & machine technique to payment fraud prevention. I’ll explain how we employ sophisticated machine learning tools – open source and in-house developed.\nI will also present results from experiments conducted on a very large graph data set containing millions of edges and vertices."
