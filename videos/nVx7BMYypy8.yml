description: 'You want to design customer-focused, easy-to-use products that your customers will love - but you aren’t doing your job if you wait until the last minute (or beyond!) to think about privacy. Tacking on privacy features as an afterthought isn’t only bad for your users, it’s also bad for your company. Privacy starts with your backend systems and carries forward through your product development cycle, your user testing, your product release, and all the way to your customer support. Learn how to build privacy into your products from the ground up, and create an awesome privacy story for both your company and your users.'
