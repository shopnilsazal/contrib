description: "By Pieter Hintjens\r\n\r\nI'll speak about a new messaging protocol called AMQP, and the iMatix projects that implement this protocol.\r\n\r\nAMQP makes it possible to make cheap, fast distributed applications, for pubsub, cloud computing, telecoms, etc.. I'll explain our OpenAMQ implementation of AMQP, and also our web-based RESTful messaging project, Zyre, which makes AMQP work over plain HTTP. This talk is aimed at FOSS developers with interest in new protocols. AMQP is a good example of how large businesses are promoting and investing in FOSS today.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
