description: 'Go''s concurrency model lends itself nicely to building real-time data pipelines, but how does this work out at scale? At Riot, we handle millions of player events, metrics and logs daily through a series of Go-based microservices -- this tutorial will help attendees get comfortable with Go concurrency in practice, and walk through some of the best practices for architecting and operating real-time distributed systems with Go at their heart, including lessons learned along the way.'
