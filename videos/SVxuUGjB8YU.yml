But not everybody uses its full power. Moreover, most only use a fraction of the functionality it provides.\n\nThe reality is that an IDE is not just about a set of integrated tools, but an environment that understands the semantics of your project, of what youâ€™re doing. It can leverage this to provide you with functionality that can make repetitive mundane tasks become frictionless, as well as give insight into potential problems.\n\nIn this session, we will go through the most powerful features the IDE offers and whether you do web development or work with data using Python, you will benefit knowing how the IDE can leverage your programming skills.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
