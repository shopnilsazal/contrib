description: "RubyConf 2016 - JRuby Everywhere! Server, Client, and Embedded by Thomas Enebo\n\nRuby has seen its heaviest on servers; Client-side Ruby has been limited to experiments and toys, and Ruby C extensions complicate embedded use. But there's a better way: JRuby. Using frameworks like JRubyFX and Shoes 4, among many GUI and graphics libraries, JRuby makes client-side development fast and powerful. With an embedded JVM, JRuby runs your app on mid-level embedded devices without compiling a line of code. And JRuby is still the best way to power up your Rails 5 app. Come learn how to use JRuby everwhere!"
