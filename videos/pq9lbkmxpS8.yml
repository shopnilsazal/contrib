description: "Cluster Federation in Kubernetes: Past, Present and the Future - Madhu C.S. & Quinton Hoole, Google\n\nIn this session, I want to briefly present the current state of cluster federation in Kubernetes mainly focusing on what we aimed to accomplish, where we are today and where we want to go. After that I want to open the floor for discussion. The goal of the session is to discuss about the potential use-cases, challenges that people face while running cross-cluster workloads and the challenges that are hindering Kubernetes Cluster Federation adoption today. I would also like to listen to the feedback from our current users and hear about their experiences.\n\nAbout Madhu C.S.\nMadhu C.S. (madhusudancs@{github, slack, twitter}) is a Software Engineer on the Kubernetes team at Google where he works on Cluster Federation. Before Kubernetes, he worked on a number of different projects within Google Cloud. He also has a strong background in compilers and has worked on a JIT-compiler project at Google.
