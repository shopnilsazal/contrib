description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2015 in San Francisco\nhttps://2015.appsecusa.org/\n\nSecure Authentication without the Need for Passwords\n\nThe recent major hacks at Sony, Target, Home Depot, Chase and Anthem all have something in common; they all gained access by stolen credentials. Hacking credit/debit cards is a growth industry, 66% CAGR. As more information and transactions are conducted online, the need for securing this information and these transactions is becoming paramount. There is increasing pressure to secure this information, customers wants it and shareholders are demanding it. Government regulations are good but they come slowly and the fraudsters seem to be gaining the upper hand. \n\nThere are a number of various biometric technologies being used with moderate success. Fingerprint, facial recognition, iris scan and voice recognition all provide a good level of security but are week in the area of usability. \n\nBehavioral Biometrics is an area that offers ease of use, high level of security and does not require the need for passwords. An additional benefit is that there is nothing to remember, no special equipment and no personal identifiable information is used. Unlike the other biometric modes, the attributes are revocable which is useful in the corporate world. \nHow does it work? One scenario is authenticating login. It is a software-based second-factor biometric authentication solution. The technology compares, in real-time, users’ keying of known text against a previously-assembled cadence and habit library built using that known text. No keystroke character data is required for this comparison, only the keystroke timing data. \n\nSome software algorithms function by comparing two chunks of independent typing samples (any text) and provides a statistical analysis of whether the same person typed it and how confident that is it the same person. Applications include, insider threat analysis, continuous monitoring, determining if it is still you after have successful login, and validating distance learning/certification.\n\nDon Malloy\nChair, Initiative for Open Authentication OATH\nDonald Malloy is the Chairman of OATH, The Initiative for Open Authentication.
