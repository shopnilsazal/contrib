description: "by Vissarion Fysikopoulos\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nWhat is a great circle, a loxodrome or a geodesic? What are the differencesbetween them and which one is more suitable for each GIS application? Thistalk addresses this kind of questions and how geography is implemented inBoost.Geometry. The library that is currently being used to provide GISsupport to MySQL.\n\nFollowing up the introductory talk on Boost.Geometry we discuss thealgorithmic, the implementation as well as the user perspective of thedevelopment of geography in Boost.Geometry. We define basic geometric objectssuch as geodesics, and the modeling of the Earth as a sphere or ellipsoid. Wetry to understand the effect of different Earth models to the accuracy andspeed of fundamental geometric algorithms (such as length, area, intersectionetc.) by showing particular examples. Finally, we are having a look towardsthe future of geography in Boost.Geometry.\n\n_Comment: This is an entry-level talk on subjects of GIS, geometric algorithmsand Boost.Geometry. Attending the introductory talk on Boost.Geometry willhelp the audience to have a more detailed understanding of the Boost.Geometrydevelopment but it is not considered as a prerequisite._\n\n\nRoom: H.2214\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 15:40:00"
