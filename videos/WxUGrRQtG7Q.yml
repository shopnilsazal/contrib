description: "By Byron Reese\n\nThis talk explores how the widespread proliferation of cheap sensors of all kinds will create a vast collective memory for the planet which will serve as a record of every cause and effect. This data will be scoured for associations that will be turned into algorithms which optimize every decision we have to make in life. And while we may not always choose to do those things, it will effectively make every person on the planet vastly wiser than the wisest person who has ever lived. In the future, no one will ever need to make a mistake again.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8E/"
