description: "We're facing a tidal wave of rescue projects. So many developers dive into writing Rails applications without building a real foundation in Ruby. Instead we focus on the new whiz-bang features of Rails or the hot gem of the weekâ€”missing the awesomeness right in front of us.\n\nLet's talk about Ruby and fill in some of the gaps. This isn't about mind-blowing features and crazy metaprogramming, it's about the fundamentals that are often overlooked in Rails applications.\n\n    WTF are modules, anyway?\n    Writing utility objects\n    Measuring performance\n    Everything worth manipulating is a collection\n    Rails \"features\" that Ruby does better\n    Bringing science back into development\n\nMaster these techniques, and write better applications with better Ruby."
