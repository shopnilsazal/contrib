description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #13\n29 April 2018\nSponsored by JP Morgan and Hosted by Google Campus\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nAudio recordings are a data source of great value used for analyzing conversations and enabling digital assistants. An important aspect of analyzing single-channel audio conversations is identifying who said what, a task known as speaker diarization. The task is further complicated when the number of speakers is a priori unknown. In this talk we’ll dive into the deep learning research of speaker \"embedding\" (verification and diarization). Connect it to a framework of “real” speaker separation needs (as in audio applications such as Chorus.ai’s Conversation Analytics platform), and present the pipeline required for integrating these solutions in a semi supervised manner without requiring any effort by the end user.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
