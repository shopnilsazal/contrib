description: "BY: GODFREY CHAN\n\nIn this session, we will look at several unconventional things you can do with Ember.js and Ember Data. We will be breathing new life into the Hacker News website via a chrome extension. We will be injecting code into the live website, parsing HTML pages into JSON feeds that Ember Data understands, all while maintaining the existing URL mapping scheme so that our users can continue to share and tweet URLs with the rest of the Interwebs.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GO1L/"
