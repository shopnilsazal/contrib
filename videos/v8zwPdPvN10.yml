description: "Procedural generation changes the design approach of every system it touches, offering infinite variation. But how is it used in a concrete way, for developers actually at work on their game? In this 2016 GDC talk, designers from Dwarf Fortress and Moon Hunters share their tools and methods for implementing procedurally generated experiences, by live-editing their game systems during this session.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
