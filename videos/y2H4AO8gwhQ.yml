description: "Building Maintainable JavaScript Applications by Marius Gundersen is a talk held at Web Rebels where we even got to see some Java code! A brave man!\nHow long can a JavaScript app live without being maintained? How long until the browsers it was designed for is outdated? How long until bugs have to be fixed or new functionality is needed? And will the developer tasked with these jobs remember or understand how the application works?\nWriting JavaScript code is fast and easy, but reading that code is often slow and difficult. By writing code which is easy to read and understand we get an application which is straight forward to debug and improve. This makes the application maintainable, and now anyone can go in and quickly fix or extend it.\nIn this talk I want to focus on maintainable JavaScript applications. Together we will write a such an application using a collection of frameworks including Knockout.js and Require.js. We will look at some of the high and low level principles of maintainable code and how the architecture of our client side app can help make it easy to read, understand, debug and test."
