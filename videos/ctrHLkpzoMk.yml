description: "Abstract: \nConflict in cyberspace moves quickly, is primarily asynchronous and can be carried out by a broad range of centralized and decentralized adversaries with great effectiveness. There are many nuanced aspects to this field that make playing defense difficult, offensive deception and challenges in attribution are two which stand out in particular. This talk will focus on applying deception techniques in a security program beyond the standard of honeypots that exists today. We will enumerate and adapt the various means that military and political operations employ deception in a strategic capacity and what we can learn from these other fields.\n\nby Robert Wood, Chief Security Officer at SourceClear\n\nRobert Wood is a security technologist, strategic advisor, and speaker.
