description: "Paul Ferguson, Trend Micro, Inc.\n\nTrend Micro's Threat Research group is specially tasked with looking forward on the threat landscape and working with technology and/or various product development groups inside the company to ensure that, as a company, we deliver the appropriate security solutions to address emerging threats to our customers. To accomplish this requires our threat research group to understand, explore, and deconstruct various malicious technologies, campaigns, vulnerabilities, and exploits which are currently being perpetrated on victims today. With this in mind, I have briefly outlined below what we are currently witnessing as \"emerging threats\" which pose serious potential risks to our customers, and others in their daily use of the Internet and beyond."
