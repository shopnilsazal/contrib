description: "Ruby is a delightful language to work with. And yet, for years, we've been hearing about how MRI is too slow and inefficient for \"serious\" use. What does that mean? What would a \"serious\" Ruby runtime look like?\n\nTo understand these questions, we need to dig into the design of MRI. How does it work, and what are the underlying principles? What does common Ruby code look like as its executed by MRI? Once we've discovered what makes MRI tick, we can compare it to modern runtimes like Hotspot and V8 to understand why MRI is slower. From there we can take a look at JRuby and Rubinius and see how they seek to close the gap between Ruby runtimes and the competition.\n\nIn this talk, we'll dive into the internals of MRI, seeking to understand how it executes Ruby code. We'll look at ways to make our code faster, reduce garbage collection overhead, and find more concurrency in our programs. At the end, you will have a better understanding of how MRI works and how to write better code for it.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG9D/"
