description: "CESLA has launched \"The wiki for open technologies \" project. This project is addressed to the open source community and to the Internet world on the whole to allow collaboration between different groups and organizations. \r\n\r\nBy oscar puyal\r\n\r\nThe talk will cover the following topics: \r\n\r\n◦Thewiki4opentech policy and goals \r\n◦What is different in the technological wiki? \r\n◦How to contribute. \r\n◦Benefits for contributors and for the open source community.\r\nThe Wiki for Open Technologies is an Internet site where you can find technical information and discuss about projects and ideas. Also you can edit almost all of the pages on this site and place new ones. This wiki is a project managed by CESLA, the Free Software & Open Content Association of Aragon, Spain. With this project CESLA intends to create a technological content reference for everybody. \r\n\r\nThewiki4opentech team is working to provide the open source community with a useful tool. This project is based on Mediawiki and implements some improvements to syndicate content with the same or compatible license. A vertical search engine, included in the wiki, allows searching in the most prestigious open source pages. Thewiki4opentech own content, the syndicated content from other wikis and the search engine cover most of the open source technical information so the community will be able to find the most relevant information and the main trends related to a topic \r\n\r\nProjects are saved as a whole and topics are sorted in tags and not just as an article, this wiki is a site where projects are well documented and classified. All improvements around projects follow the objective of empowering open source initiatives and innovation in the open source community \r\n\r\nLinks:\r\n◦http://thewiki4opentech.org \r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development.
