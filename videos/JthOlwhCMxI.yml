description: "How to Hack All the Transport Networks of a Country\nAlberto García Illera\n\nThe presentation is about a real black hacking act against the transport network of a country. It can be extrapolated to any other country. We will show how to get full access to the entire transport network. Manipulating parameters to get free tickets, getting control of the ticket machines, getting clients CC dumps, hooking internal processes to get the client info, pivoting between machines, encapsulating all the traffic to bypass the firewalls, etcetera.\n\nWe will show a lot of photos, videos, source code and presentations of the real environment and the skills used to obtain all the information. We will show how combining social engineering and technical skills can be used as a deadly weapon.\n\nAlberto García Illera is a 24 year old passionate about hacking and especially for social engineering. He studied mathematics and computer systems in Spain. He has worked several years as a professional pentester. He has spoken in several seminars teaching hacking techniques to help big companies like Microsoft, the Spanish government or the Spanish Police's Cyberterrorism department. He is currently making a study about cryptographic hash functions applied to IT security."
