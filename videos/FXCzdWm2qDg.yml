language: English
recordingDate: 1495791978
description: "A few years ago, Detectify did a blog post regarding domain hijacking using services like AWS, Heroku and GitHub. These issues still remains and are still affecting a lot of companies and there are many tools to find these vulnerabilities that have popped up after this went public.\n\nHowever, there are many more ways to hijack domains, nameservers and DNS-providers. The tools out there are missing these cases completely. Frans will go through both the currently disclosed and the non-disclosed ways to take control over domains and will share the specific techniques involved.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
