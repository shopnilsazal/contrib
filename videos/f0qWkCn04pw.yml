As a developer, you really want to be able to focus your time on creating new solutions. But as much as you might want to ignore it, you still have to ensure the apps you build scale, stay up and stay secure. Developers still need to understand and control the software supply chain: you still need to know who built what. You need to understand if your software is vulnerable, compliant with your processes and regulations, and secure. And you need to know what is running right now, where it is running, and to be able to control when it changes. So the trick is how to spend as little time as possible on these issues so you can focus on building your app. The combination of Kubernetes and Cloud can make that happen for you. At IBM we are focused on helping you focus. The IBM Cloud Container Service, which leverages Kubernetes, provides advanced capabilities for building cloud-native apps, adding DevOps to existing apps, and ultimately relieves the pain around security, scale, and infrastructure management.&nbsp;\n\nAbout Jason\nJason McGee, IBM Fellow, is VP and CTO of Container and Microservice Tribe.
