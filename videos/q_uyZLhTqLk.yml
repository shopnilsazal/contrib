title: 'Solving Configuration, Security and Collaboration Challenges in the Container Pipeline'
recordingDate: 1526489880
description: 'Moving a monolith application to run on Kubernetes was not the biggest challenge we faced when we moved Cloud 66’s stack to run on containers. We realized we have to change the way we think about pipelines, security, managing environments, and configuration to truly benefit from this move and keep the pipeline—and the clusters—in lockstep with code. In this webinar, we will share what we’ve learned so far, and some tooling we’ve developed to solve our problems—which are now open sourced.'
