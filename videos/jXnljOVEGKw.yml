description: "Over the past year, Heroku has expanded by going polyglot and supporting languages like Java, Clojure, Python, Node.js, and Scala in addition to Ruby. In this session, we will discuss major updates to the platform and our emphasis on making the Ruby developer experience even better. We'll leave plenty of time at the end for any questions.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGiz/"
