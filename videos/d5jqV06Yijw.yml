description: "Slides Here: https://defcon.org/images/defcon-22/dc-22-presentations/Rowley/DEFCON-22-Robert-Rowley-Detecting-Defending-Against-Surveillance-State.pdf\n\nDetecting and Defending Against a Surveillance State \nRobert RowleySECURITY RESEARCHER, TRUSTWAVE SPIDERLABS \nThis talk is based on semi-recent reported leaks that detail how state-actors could be engaging in surveillance against people they deem as 'threats'. I will cover the basics on what was leaked, and focus the talk on how to detect hardware bugs, implanted radio transceivers, firmware injections, cellular network monitoring, etc...\n\nNo need to bring your tin-foil hats though, the discussion here is a pragmatical approach to how to detect such threats and identify if you have been targeted. No blind faith approaches, or attempts to sell any privacy snake oil will be found here.\n\nRobert is a Security Researcher for Trustwave Spiderlabs as has been an active member of the Southern California hacking scene for over the last 10+ years. Co-Founding Irvine underground and recently presenting on many topics including Juice Jacking, Web Application Security and moreâ€¦ I am presenting on a personal passion this time, Privacy."
