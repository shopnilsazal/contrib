recordingDate: 1384992256
description: "Proxy Prank-o-Matic\nCharlie Vedaa Founder @ PacketProtector.org\n\"Anonymous secondary speaker\"\n\nThe Upside-Down-Ternet was just the beginning. What else can you do with a proxy server and a mischievous mind? We'll show you how to send your victims back in time (fun with archive.org), to the all-porn Internet (is there any other kind?), or to the Tourette-net (Cartman runs the Internets)! Via browser settings or port forwarding, using your Squid server or ours, you'll learn how to torment your friends in 20 fast-paced minutes.\n\nCharlie Vedaa is a Network Architect for the FBI's CJIS Division. He is the founder of the PacketProtector project (http://packetprotector.org), an OpenWrt-based security distro for wireless routers.\n\nThe \"Anonymous secondary speaker\" is more l33t than you. Randomized address spaces spontaneously reorganize in his presence.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
