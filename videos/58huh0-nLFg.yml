recordingDate: 1448290248
description: "Droidcon Paris 2015\nThis talk presents the new 'experiments' feature of the Play Store and how to make to most of it. The presentation includes an explanation of how using experiments can have a very high return on investment compared to in-app testing, and gives tips and feedback based on our own experience with the Experiments tool. We will cover what worked and what did not work, as well as common mistakes to avoid. We will also explain how to extend learning from the experiments to other part of the business. \n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/alexisfogel/improve-your-android-app-metrics\n\nDroidcon Paris 2015, more information here: http://droidcon.fr/schedule/"
