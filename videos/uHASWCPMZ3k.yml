description: "By, Nickolas Means\nAs developers, we spend more of our time writing than we do thinking about the nuances of computer science. What would happen if we approached code like a writing exercise instead of a technical pursuit? What if we applied patterns from elegant prose instead of Gang of Four? Let's try it!\n\nWe'll take some smelly Ruby and refactor it using only advice from Strunk and White's \"The Elements of Style\", the canonical text on writing beautiful, understandable English. You'll come away with a new approach to your craft and a new appreciation of the similarities between great writing and great code.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FixO/"
