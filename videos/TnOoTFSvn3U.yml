description: "Panel: The Making of DEF CON 20\n\nHave you ever wondered what it takes to put DEF CON together, Well now is your chance to find out. DEF CON is broken down into 10 departments: Security, Networking, Press, Speaker Ops, Contests, Vendors, Swag Booth, Registration, Quarter Master, and Operations. Each of the department heads (aka the DEF CON Planning Staff) will be part of this panel and will give an overview of what we do the other 361 days of the year to plan DEF CON. There will also be time for Q& A from the audience so if you want to know how we do this, come prepared with questions."
