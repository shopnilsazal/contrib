language: English
recordingDate: 1515100973
description: "This week, James is joined by friend of the show Simina Pasat, HockeyApp Program Manager, who walks us through exactly what Continuous Integration (CI) is and how it applies to mobile application development. Simina dispels the myth that CI is extremely difficult and time consuming. She shows us how to automatically build and sign Xamarin applications in Visual Studio Team Services in just a few minutes completely from scratch! We then discusses a bit more of what to do next with the app that was just built by sending it to HockeyApp as part of continuous delivery.\n\nShow Links:\n\nFollow @SiminaPasat: https://twitter.com/siminapasat\nFollow @HockeyApp: https://twitter.com/HockeyApp\n\nFind James on Twitter: http://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno \nGitHub: http://github.com/jamesmontemagno\nBlog: https://montemagno.com\nand his weekly development podcast Merge Conflict: http://www.mergeconflict.fm\n\nNever Miss an Episode: https://twitter.com/thexamarinshow\nFollow @TheXamarinShow\n\nUseful Links:\n\nXamarin Developer Center & Blog: https://developer.xamarin.com/\nXamarin and Azure: https://www.xamarin.com/azure\nMobile DevOps: https://www.xamarin.com/mobile-devops\nXamarin University Self-Guided: https://university.xamarin.com/self-guided\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree"
