description: "What Happens When Something Goes Wrong? On Kubernetes Reliability [I] - Marek Grabowski & Tina Zhang, Google\n\nOne of the best features of the Kubernetes is that it can automatically recover from various failures and keep your application working despite unfavorable circumstances. There are moments when this works like magic and operators won't even notice something was going on. Sadly, sometimes automation fails.\n\nIn this talk we're going to describe various policies and mechanisms that are implemented in the system designed to keep user applications and cluster in general running. We'll talk both about things that will happen automatically and those that users need to configure.\n\nAbout Marek Grabowski\nMarek is a Software Engineer turned Site Reliability Engineer late 2017. Currently he focuses on reliability of Kubernetes clusters. Since 2013 he has been working on Googleâ€™s Technical Infrastructure, where early 2015 he joined Kubernetes engineering team. In Kubernetes his main focus was scalability and machine management. Before Kubernetes he was working on Google internal orchestrator in Omega project.\n\nAbout Tina Zhang\nTina joined the Google as a Site Reliability Engineer for GKE in March 2017 and has primarily been working on delivering High Availability Masters in GKE, bringing GKE to more cloud regions and improving monitoring and alerting for the system. Prior to this, she had a previous life as an investment banker at J.P. Morgan."
