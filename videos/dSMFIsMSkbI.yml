description: "By Alistair Cockburn\nThe Crystal 3-step model consists of practices, principles, and personalization. The practices are what you know or learn how to do. The principles are the laws of design that inform you as to what works better, when. Personalization is adapting yourself to your situation, and your practices to your personality. In this closing keynote, Dr. Alistair Cockburn will incorporate the history of Agile development (which started at Snowbird) into the evolution of what we know about software development, leading to how to use the Crystal 3-step model to improve your and your team's performance.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Hi0y/"
