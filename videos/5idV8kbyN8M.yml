Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nHabitat Builder: Cloud Native Application Automation - Elliott Davis & Fletcher Nichol, Chef.io (Habitat.sh) (Beginner Skill Level)\n\nThere are a plethora of build tools and package managers out in the universe, but no one way to ensure a happy path from local development to production when you have a system of any interesting complexity. This talk explains why we built Habitat Builder, as an open source cloud native application automation engine, and how you can use it to build and ship your applications with Kubernetes and the packaging tools like Helm that you know and love, for a better development-to-cluster lifecycle. We'll go over existing build tools, their pro's and con's, industry best practices, and what Habitat Builder adds to the mix.\n\nAbout Fletcher\nSoftware Developer, works on Habitat https://www.habitat.sh/\n\nAbout Elliott\nElliott is a core maintainer on the Habitat team with a focus on developer experience and cloud native technologies. One of his favorite hobbies is disrupting team stand-ups with dad jokes."
