But in a world of constant change, how do you determine the right thing to do? Which pebble to tread on? How do you understand where you're going and where you need to go? How do you know if your strategy is right? Is there even such a thing?\n\n In this talk, we start by examining the issue of situational awareness and how it applies to technology.
