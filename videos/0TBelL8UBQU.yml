description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nManaging Kubernetes: What You Need to Know About Day 2 - Craig Tracey, Heptio (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nOK, so you have successfully deployed Kubernetes, but now what? This presentation will provide insights on how to best leverage your \"Day 2\" software deployment and operations with Kubernetes. With dozens of real-world customer use cases to dissect from, we will cover the commonalities amongst deployments, the unforeseen failures, the most-often misunderstood features, and a redux of top-ranked best-practices that will result in a successful production roll-out. From user management to labelling policies and all the way through to upgrades, we will show you how our customers \"went live.\" Beyond just the technical, this talk will also cover the organizational constructs that have yielded successful outcomes.\n\nAbout Craig\nFor the last 20 years Craig has helped build the infrastructure that powers the Internet. In this time he has had the opportunity to develop everything from kernel device drivers, to massive-scale cloud storage services, and even a few distributed compute platforms. Now as a Software Engineer turned Solutions Engineer at Heptio, he helps organizations accelerate their adoption of Kubernetes by teaching the principles of cloud native architectures through code. Craig is based in Boston, Massachusetts; spending the winters playing hockey and the summers getting lost in Europe."
