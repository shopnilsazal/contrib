description: "Uri Shaked\nGoogle Developer Expert\n\nhttps://medium.com/@urish/building-simon-with-angular2-iot-fceb78bb18e5#.tybe0yoqf\n\nUri started developing software at the age of 12. Since then, he's been pursuing his passion for technology, both professionally and through notable side projects and community activities. He's also a lean startup enthusiast, a Launchpad mentor, and the lead of Tel Aviv’s Google Developer Group. Uri is an Angular.JS expert too, who lectures in an advanced web development code lab at the Technion, Israel’s Institute of Technology. Among his interests are reverse engineering, hardware hacking, and mobile development. Uri is an avid Salsa dancer and a musician – and enjoys bringing his passions together for projects like SalsaBeatMachine.org\n\n\nAngular 2, of Things\n\nAs web developers, we use JavaScript to create wonderful apps that run inside a web browser. But what if we could leverage the same technology to program physical devices that interact with the real world? In this session, we will combine Angular 2 with some IoT sauce to create a hardware game."
