description: "by Ivo Raisr and Tomáš Jedlička\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nSPARC is an instruction set architecture (ISA) originally developed by SunMicrosystems since 1980's. Today's largest enterprise servers run on sparc,leveraging several terabytes of memory and several hundreds of CPUs. This talkwill briefly introduce key concepts of sparcv9 ISA and the big picture wheresupport of a new architecture fits into Valgrind architecture. Someinteresting problems during the port will be discussed together with solutionsand still-to-be-solved issues. Finally a live demo will conclude the talk. Thetalk assumes basic knowledge of Valgrind, interaction among Valgrindsubsystems, basic assembly and VEX IR notation. It is targeted to allinterested in sparcv9 ISA and running Valgrind on sparc.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.119 (Moved from AW1.124)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 10:30:00"
