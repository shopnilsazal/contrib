recordingDate: 1392969168
description: "FX and FtR - Attacking Networked Embedded Systems\nServers, workstations and PCs are the common targets of an average attacker, but there is much more to find in todays networks. Every device that has a processor, some memory and a network interface can become a target. Using printers and other common devices as examples, we will show how to exploit design failures and vulnerabilities and use the target as an attack platform. We will also release some tools, methods and sample code to entertain the audience and aid further vulnerability research in this area.\n\nFX is the leader of the German Phenoelit Group. His and the groups interest is in less known or commonly ignored protocols, devices and techniques. FtR of Phenoelit is the resident Perl guru and algorithm guy of the group."
