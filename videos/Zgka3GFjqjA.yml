description: "Ops for Developers - Monitor Your Java Application with Prometheus [I] - Alexander Schwartz, msg systems ag\n\nPrometheus is ready-to-go to monitor your infrastructure and your containers. Capturing simple metrics from a Java application can be done automatically. But Developers need to go one step further to provide useful application and business metrics. This talk shows how to collect meaningful metrics in Vert.x and Spring based Java applications. It applies Dropwizard Metrics to gather internal application statistics, and Hystrix to provide metrics of the external interfaces the application consumes. It also shows how to fill gaps by writing your own collector. By providing end-to-end examples this talk enables developers to make their application ready for production.\n\nAbout Alexander Schwartz\nAlexander Schwartz is Principal IT Consultant at msg systems. Heâ€™s been in Web development for more than 15 years and enjoys productive working environments, agile projects and automated tests. At conferences and user group meetings he talks about the things he is passionate about."
