title: 'Winston Bond - OWASP Mobile Top Ten 2014 - The New Lack of Binary Protection Category'
language: English
recordingDate: 1404316427
description: "in replacement of Jonathan Carter\n\nRecently, there has been a new addition to the OWASP Mobile Top Ten; a lack of binary protections. At AppSec California, OWASP debuted it and briefly highlighted examples of the threats to mobile devices in this category. In this talk I will discuss the new category in much more depth, exploring reasons why this risk category has now been included in OWASP's Top Ten Mobile Security Risks.\n\nIn 2013, consumers downloaded more than 83 billion applications from app stores worldwide, with revenues totalling $25 billion. According to Portio research, this is expected to grow to over 200 billion downloads per year by 2017. It is clear that the App Economy is not only thriving, but is driving new app-centric products and services across multiple industries and with the continued adoption of mobile computing, the threats to mobile and applications is continuing to grow.\n\nBased on research conducted by Arxan, we found that over half of the top 100 iOS apps had been hacked or tampered with and made available for download on third party app stores. This included 53 percent of Android, and 23 percent of mobile banking and payment applications.\n\nThe talk will specifically highlight the risks that a lack of binary protections poses to mobile applications on both iOS and Android platforms. The speaker will discuss how to leverage specific OWASP projects to solve these issues and secure apps from tampering. By the end of the talk, attendees will have a solid understanding of the risks associated with lack of binary protections and how to begin thinking about incorporating app risk mitigation solutions to protect their applications. Risk mitigation approaches discussed will include how to incorporate processes that harden an app against binary-level integrity and reverse-engineering attacks launched at rest and run-time. \n\n-\n\nAppSecEU 2014 in Cambridge\nhttps://2014.appsec.eu/\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project\n"
