description: "\"With the rising popularity of JRuby and Rails itself allowing concurrent requests by default, it is about time we Ruby programmers learned something about dealing with concurrency.\n\nThis talk will focus on explaining thread safety, immutability and concurrency for the Ruby programmer and how to avoid basic pitfalls and write code that works well in a multi-threaded environment. We will also look at using libraries like Akka that provide a nice abstraction over writing multi-threaded code.\n\nFinally, we will also look at how functional programming deals with concurrency in a better manner and what tools does Ruby provide to write more \"\"functional\"\" code.\"\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8D/"
