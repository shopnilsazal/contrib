description: "Air Traffic Control: Insecurity and ADS-B\nRighter Kunkel Security Researcher\n\nThis presentation will take a look at the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system from a pilot's view. I have found some interesting security problems with the ATC system. We will start the talk by explaining how the current ATC system works. Talk about an interesting attack vector that starts with going to a doctor to get a class 3 physical. We will talk about the future ATC system and how security may go from bad to worse. I want to open peoples eyes to the insecurity of the ATC system.\n\nRighter Kunkel (CISA, CISSP, CISM) is a security researcher. He is a private pilot with about 200 hours of flight time. Righter's background includes positions as global education manager and senior network security consultant at CyberGuard Corporation.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
