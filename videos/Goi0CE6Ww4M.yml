description: "Objective-C might look like a crazy, complex and verbose language to the seasoned Rubyist.\nIn reality, they share many features.\n\nThis allows you to use your knowledge of Ruby to quickly get started with Objective-C.\n\nIn this talk, I will give an overview of the syntax and semantics of Objective-C and compare and contrast it with Ruby where appropriate.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG3V/"
