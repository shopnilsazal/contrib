description: "Sean O Toole - Metamorphic Viruses\nMetamorphic Viruses\n\nThis talk will cover the components and theory behind metamorphic engines. Also, how they create a better stealth method for viruses since it will cause the body of the virus to completely change in apperance while still containing the same functionality. This method of virus writing has gained much attention since this century, compared to it's earlier day, which include the '98 Win95/Regswap and others whose techniques have now developed into what we know as Metamorphism today.\n\nSean O'Toole is currently in college for Computer Science and Mathematics. I've been playing around with viruses since high school and also took an independent study on computer viruses in college. As well as the above, I've also helped institutions such as NCAR use Artificial Life Algorithms for modeling."
