There is\neven a Diversity Statement at PSF: \"We have created this diversity\nstatement because we believe that a diverse Python community is\nstronger and more vibrant. A diverse community where people treat each\nother with respect has more potential contributors and more sources\nfor ideas.\" The authors will share experiences on diversity obtained\nfrom ten different countries: Namibia, UK, Japan, Brazil, Italy,\nArgentina, Uruguay, Germany, Canada and Spain. There are other reports\nthat we also would like to share, which are only beautiful stories of\nhow Python reaches the most distant people and places you may never\nhave imagined."
