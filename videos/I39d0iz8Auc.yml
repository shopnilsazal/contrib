description: 'Are you a Java developer knowledgeable of Spring, JavaEE, OSGi, injection, JavaFX, or even Swing? Have you noticed the decline of buzz around these technologies? Are you wondering what the buzz about Angular.js, React.js, node.js, Ruby on Rails, Python mean in context of Java? Are you about to give up on JVM and learn completely new technologies? You don''t have to. There is, in our opinion, a way to find synergy between the stability and maturity of Java and the best ideas in the emerging and popular technologies out there. Let us walk you through the history of Java/JavaScript relation, describe various attempts to bridge one to the other and finally show you OracleLabs GraalVM - polyglot JVM capable to execute Java, JavaScript, Ruby, R & other languages at full speed and full interop. Let us show you how easy it is to introduce the new languages and their ideas in an incremental fashion while building your existing Java enterprise workflow. Sun Microsystems motto used to be ''Innovation happens elsewhere'' - let us show you that JVM and Java ecosystem are still a place where great innovations can happen.'
