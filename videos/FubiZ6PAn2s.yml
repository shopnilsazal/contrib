description: "by My Lê\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nWe know the expression ‘Open Source’; what about ‘Open Design’? How could wedefine ‘Open Design’? Design creative process is not disclosed. The secrecyaround it is of the utmost importance in order to prevent the originalcreations from being stolen. The different stages of the process and thetechniques used are only known by those involved in the design. How could wecall this stance into question and open the creative process? This talk willpresent existing initiatives and thoughts to make Graphic Design and OpenFonts fields more available to the public.\n\nFirst I will introduce graphic designers and typographers who open theirprocess: why do they share their practice? why is it interesting? how and whyis it useful? I will talk about originality and copy: we should not be afraidof copying. Moreover copying can be an opportunity to improve the originaldesign. About Mozilla rebranding: I will point out some suggestions to furtherthat initiative. How could designers take part and get committed? Finally Iwill give designers food for thought to defend their work, explain andcommunicate it, and better collaborate with their team and people who are notdesigners.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 08:00:00"
