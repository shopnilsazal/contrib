description: "You _could_ work in a business park. You _could_ lust after an office with a window. You _could_ have a monthly company \"meeting\" at that bar you have to drive to. Or you could change your environment. I helped create Bendyworks with a firm commitment to the importance of environment. We work downtown, above a bar, across the street from a microbrewery. We all pair program in one big room with a rotating music selection. We have book club and daily standups and weekly game nights (with beverages from aforementioned microbrewery). Learn from me - a beer connoisseur, former ski racer, and ruby business owner - about how to change your Ruby Environment.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GZCj/"
