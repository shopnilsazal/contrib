description: "Panel - Defcon Security Jam III: Now in 3-D?\nThey say third time is the charm. Some of the biggest mouths in Information Security are back again and once again, we will show you all new of security FAIL. Our panelists will demonstrate innovative hacking techniques in naked routing, web application (in)security, and wireless goats. After taking a sabatical year, we are also proud to announce that Chris \"Squirrel\" Hoff will be keeping the rest of us honest with his real-time snarkage. Speaking of real time, moderator David Mortman will be making waffles (and maybe pizzelles) on stage as rewards for best comments, questions and shared fail.\n\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
