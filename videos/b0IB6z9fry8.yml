description: "This talk will show attendees how to use a small ARM-based computer that is connected inline to a wired network for penetration testing. The computer is running a full-featured penetration testing Linux distro. Data may be exfiltrated using the network or via a ZigBee mesh network or GSM modem.\n\nThe device discussed in this talk is easily integrated into a powerful penetration test that is performed with an army of ARM-based small computer systems connected by XBee or ZigBee mesh networking.\n\nSome familiarity with Linux and penetration testing would be helpful, but not required.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nPhil was born at an early age. He cleaned out his savings at age 8 in order to buy a TI99-4A computer for the sum of $450. Two years later he learned 6502 assembly and has been hacking computers and electronics ever since.\n\nDr. Phil currently works as a professor at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania. His research focus over the last few years has been on the use of microcontrollers and small embedded computers for forensics and pentesting. Phil has developed a custom pentesting Linux distro and related hardware to allow an inexpensive army of remote pentesting drones to be built using the BeagleBone Black computer boards. This work is described in detail in Phil's book \"Hacking and Penetration Testing With Low Power Devices\" (Syngress, 2015).\n\nPrior to entering academia, Phil held several high level positions at well-known US companies. He holds a couple of the usual certs one might expect for someone in his position. When not working, he likes to spend time with his family, fly, hack electronics, and has been known to build airplanes."
