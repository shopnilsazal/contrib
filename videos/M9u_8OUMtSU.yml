description: "Learn about the FTC’s efforts to push for improvements in IoT security, including our law enforcement actions challenging inadequate data security in devices like webcams and routers, upcoming workshops on emerging technology issues including drones and smart TVs, our Start with Security business education initiative, and the expansion of the agency’s in-house research and investigation capabilities. In January 2015 the FTC issued a report on the IoT, finding a troubling lack of security in many IoT products. We’ll provide an update on the agency’s enforcement and policy activities since then, tips for how to bring issues to the FTC’s attention, and a review of some of the challenges that remain.\n\nBios:\nTerrell McSweeny is a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission and this is her third time at DEF CON. When it comes to tech issues, Commissioner McSweeny has focused on the valuable role researchers and hackers can play protecting consumer data security and privacy. She opposes bad policy and legislative proposals like mandatory backdoors and the criminalization of hacking. She believes that enforcers like the FTC should work with the researcher community to protect consumers.\n\nJoe Calandrino, PhD is the Research Director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Office of Technology Research and Investigation. With a PhD in computer science focused on security and privacy from Princeton, Dr. Calandrino is personally motivated to see the work and views of the security community drive educated government action and policy. From personal experience uncovering vulnerabilities in voting machine source code, contributing to the cold-boot attack on disk encryption (for which he won a prestigious Pwnie Award!), or revealing ways that recommendations can leak information, he has seen how security research can teach valuable lessons and make us safer. His goals at the FTC include continuing to build both its internal technical expertise and its bonds with the larger security community."
