What really lets it shine though is movement!\n\nWhile it’s not hard to animate single Android ui components, it becomes harder when these components and their animations shall depend on each other. With CoordinatorLayout the official Android Design Support Library provides a powerful, top-level ui component to make these highly dynamic dependencies easily manageable.\n\nThe first part of this session wants to cover what’s possible out of the box using CoordinatorLayout together with some other widgets and latest additions of the Design Support Library.\n\nThe second half then aims to provide deeper insights of how CoordinatorLayout actually works. The talk will explain the basic concepts it is build on as well as its apis that developers can use to build their own ui behaviors.\n\nAfter the talk you will be able to define complex dependencies between your ui components and make your app shine without losing your mind in animation listener hell.\n\nSpeaker: Matthias Friedrich, Jimdo\n\n#droidconDE – cc-by-sa 3.0"
