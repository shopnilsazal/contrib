You are not alone! There are many tools, practices and services that will make your life easier... and efficient!\n\nSeveral months ago I joined Help Scout as the only Android Developer with the main purpose of building their Android application from scratch. Coming from an agency environment where there were more than 30 developers willing to discuss and present different ideas, it's been quiet a challenge.\n\nThis talk shares my experience, explaining what tools, practices and methodologies I've followed. Being the only developer is no impediment to build great quality code, follow good design patterns and delight your users.\n\nHow to do Pull Requests, Code Reviews, Design Reviews, Continuous Delivery and Integration... Wether you are a one man band or work with a team, these tips will help you become a better programmer!\n\nType: Android development\nExperience: beginner\n\nAlex Karp Production"
