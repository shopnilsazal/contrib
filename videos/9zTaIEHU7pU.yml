description: "Hacking Wireless Networks of the Future: Security in Cognitive Radio Networks \nHUNTER SCOTT\n\nM2M, IoT, whatever buzzword you want to use, telecoms are predicting and preparing for a huge increase in embedded, connected devices within the next 10 years and predict spectrum utilization will increase even faster in the next 5 years. One of the ways this growth will be addressed is with cognitive radio networks. This talk will discuss the new kinds of security issues that are faced by these networks, particularly TV Whitespace. It will NOT presuppose knowledge of RF engineering and will work up from the basics of what cognitive radio is to the security challenges it faces, many of which are not yet solved. It will also release a new hardware platform for building and breaking cognitive radio networks.\n\nHunter Scott is a computer engineer who can't not build things. His work is in robotics, embedded systems, and lately, RF engineering. He recently discovered that working at a startup is really fun.\n\nMaterials: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/HScott/DEFCON-21-Scott-Security-in-Cognitive-Radio-Networks-Updated.pdf"
