description: "In real life, people often do several things at the same time, but games typically limit agents to performing actions sequentially. In this GDC 2014 talk, Maxis' Peter Ingebretson explains how, in The Sims 4, they developed a system for authoring interactions that allows simulated people (called Sims) to express multiple concurrent behaviors.This system allows Sims in The Sims 4 to convincingly eat, watch TV, chat with other Sims, express emotion, and perform many more behaviors simultaneously. Ingebretson believes that this powerful and simple technique could be applied to a similar effect in your game too.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
