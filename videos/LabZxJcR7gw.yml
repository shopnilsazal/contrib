description: "PyCon Canada 2015: https://2015.pycon.ca/en/schedule/31/\n\nTalk Description:\nTimekeeping is no easy business. This talk tells the story of how earthquakes and even the Moon force the concept of the \"leap second\", and the debacle in 2012 that took down most of the Internet. It also goes into some detail at how Python is handling this scenario."
