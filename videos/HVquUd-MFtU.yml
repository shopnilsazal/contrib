He brought his inventions and ideas to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1991, founding, what was to later become the MIT Wearable Computing Project. He also built the world's first covert fully functional WearComp with display and camera concealed in ordinary eyeglasses in 1995, for the creation of his award winning documentary ShootingBack. He received his PhD degree from MIT in 1997 in the new field he had initiated. He is also the inventor of the chirplet transform, a new mathematical framework for signal processing. Mann was both the founder and the Publications Chair of the first IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computing (ISWC97).\n\nMann has chaired the first Special Issue on Wearable Computing in Personal Technologies Journal, and has given numerous Keynote Addresses on the subject, including the Keynote at the first International Conference on Wearable Computing, the Keynote at the Virtual Reality conference, and the Keynote at the McLuhan Conference on Culture and Technology, on the subject of Privacy issues and Wearable Computers. He can be reached via e-mail at mann@eecg.toronto.edu \n\nDEF CON 7.0 was held July 9-11th, 1999, in Las Vegas Nevada USA"
