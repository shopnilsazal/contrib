title: 'Shalini De Mello, Machine Learning Inside the Car at The AI Conference 2017'
recordingDate: 1496694673
description: "Shalini De Mello is a Senior Research Scientist at NVIDIA Research since March 2013. Her interests are in computer vision and machine learning technology for human-computer interaction and smart interfaces. Her work includes NVIDIA’s shipping products for head pose tracking, hand gesture recognition, face detection, video stabilization and libraries for the development for computer vision applications on mobile platforms. She received doctoral and master’s degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2008 and 2004, respectively.\n\nMachine Learning Inside the Car\nData show that ninety percent of car crashes involve some form of driver distraction. Until we reach complete automation in cars, the driver will continue to be in the loop. To make cars safer and to enhance the driving experience, at NVIDIA, we are designing smart interfaces inside cars using computer vision and deep learning technology. The speaker will describe her research on monitoring the driver using NVIDIA’s head tracking technologies that work with color or depth data. She will also present her work on designing algorithms for low cost gaze tracking in cars. Lastly, she will present a technique for dynamic hand gesture recognition that she has developed using deep learning, which provides an alternative interface for humans to interact with cars."
