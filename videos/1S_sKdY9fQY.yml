description: "JS Performance Deep Dive  by: Apoorv Saxena\n\nPerformance is a Feature, the janky your website displays, the lesser will be the user interaction and conversions, thereby impacting the growth and revenue of your business. Yet many people are not able to understand the performance gotchas completely, and donâ€™t make it a part of their deployment process to measure the rendering performance of their webpages. In this workshop, participants will Performance Audit Web Applications to make them run them at 60fps. Workshop will consist of: Understand the working behind several jQuery functions and their performance impacts. Profiling with Dev Tools available in Browsers, to explore the rendering issues and their respective remedies. Discussion of case studies of already audited web applications, and discuss their performance remedies as well. Live Audit of Web applications by Workshop attendees."
