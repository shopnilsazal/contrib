description: "by Steven Goodwin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe session will look at the issues developers run into when developing theirown WebRTC applications. It looks at the problematic elements in the API, thecompatibility problems between browsers, missing infrastructure, and even thehuman element. All in all, it's a demonstration that a true WebRTC applicationcan't be built in a snap.\n\nLast year, I presented a talk explaining how easy it is to build a WebRTCapplication.\n\nThis year, I'll tell you the truth!\n\nIt will cover both the ideas and code necessary to move your basic applicationinto something that resembles production-ready.\n\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 09:30:00"
