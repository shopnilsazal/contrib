description: "The Fourth Conference on Artificial General Intelligence\r\nMountain View, California, USA\r\nAugust 3-6, 2011\r\n\r\nProbabilistic Programs: A New Language for AI\r\nPresented by Noah Goodman, Stanford University\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nHow can logical and probabilistic approaches to understanding\r\nintelligence be reconciled? I will argue that probabilistic\r\nprogramming is the best way to merge logic and probability, providing\r\na new set of tools for thinking about representation and inference in\r\nsystems with human-like intelligence. I will illustrate these ideas by\r\nintroducing the probabilistic programming language Church (a\r\nstochastic LISP), describing two universal inference algorithms (i.e.\r\nalgorithms that can perform probabilistic inference for any Church\r\nprogram), and giving a series of examples. These examples, drawn from\r\ncognitive science and AI, will include multi-agent reasoning and concept learning.\r\n\r\nAbout Noah Goodman: http://stanford.edu/~ngoodman/"
