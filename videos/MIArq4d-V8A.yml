description: "This talk will introduce techniques to detect Wi-Fi attacks such as Honeypots, Evil Twins, Mis-association , Hosted Network based backdoors etc. on a Windows client without the need for custom hardware or drivers. Our attack detection techniques will work for both Encrypted (WPA/WPA2 PSK and Enterprise) and Unencrypted networks.\n\nWe will also release a proof of concept tool implementing our detection techniques. Even though the focus of this talk is Windows, the same principles can be used to protect other Operating Systems, both workstation and mobile.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nVivek Ramachandran discovered the Caffe Latte attack, broke WEP Cloaking and publicly demonstrated enterprise Wi-Fi backdoors.
