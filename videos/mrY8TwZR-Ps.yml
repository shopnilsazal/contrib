description: "Hakeem Mohammed\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2016/netfringe/sfcxqk/\n\"Hadoop, the little yellow elephant has become synonymous with big data. Any discussion on “big data” is not complete without mentioning Hadoop. The technology itself is vast and has an ecosystem of its own. The entire stack is OSS and almost all of it is JVM based except for a few native bits. But does it have to be JVM based?\n\nIn this session I’ll talk about what Hadoop actually is. We’ll peek a little into the belly of the beast and walkthrough it’s high level design. After that we will go thru the project structure, its core components and run some sample apps, look at the various services that make it work. Finally we will look into why Hadoop is JVM based and look into ways for making it run on the .NET platform and the challenges involved. We will end with a discussion of a Hadoop port in the works, aptly named Hadoop.NET\""
