description: "Bruce Payette, Microsoft, Inc.\nPresented at the 2013 USENIX Configuration Management Summit (UCMS '13)\n\nHistorically, Windows has been difficult to automate and configure. The few tools that existed were weak and serious automation required manipulating a plethora of APIs. During the past six years Microsoft has transformed the Windows platform with substantial investments in PowerShell and standards-based management. These investments have dramatically increased the ability of admins (and developers) to automate Windows tasks. With the release of Windows Server 2012, nearly every server task can be automated, locally or remotely, through PowerShell or standards-based management tools."
