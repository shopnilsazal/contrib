(https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-growth-stages-of-a-programmer/answer/Andreas-Blixt) Blixt talks about three phases in the life of a developer:\n\n1. The novice hacker\n2. The philosophizing abstracter\n3. The wise hacker\n\nThe wise hacker knows the same patterns and has the same optimisation skills as the philosophising abstracterâ€Šâ€”â€Šthe difference is that the wise hacker knows that you should almost never use this knowledge."
