description: 'How prepared is your incident response team for a worst case scenario? Waiting for a crisis to happen before training for a crisis is a losing approach. For things that must become muscle memory, instinctive, you must simulate the event and go through the motions. This talk is a deep-dive technical discussion on how you can build your own DFIR simulation.
