recordingDate: 1384992368
description: "Attacking SMS. It's No Longer Your BFF\nBrandon Dixon Information Systems Security Engineer at G2, Inc.\n\nIt's the year 2009 and spam mail is still taking up a huge percentage of all email sent everyday over the Internet. Could you imagine that same messaging spam making a detour through your favorite cellular provider gateway and right to your SMS inbox? Mobile spam has not reached the same popularity as email spam, but what if it was as easy as submitting a form to spam thousands of people?\n\nResearch was done on several messaging services and implementations to identify vulnerabilities to exploit. The end result to the research was that the idea of mobile spam was easily a reality using Jabber/XMPP and some techniques already put in place by multiple vendors. This talk will conclude with a proof-of-concept web application demo that demonstrates the techniques and issues mentioned as well as thoughts for solving the next generation of spam. Expect to walk away with a new look on mobile spam and the damage that could be done just by pressing submit.\n\nBrandon Dixon is an Information Systems Security Engineer for G2, Inc. He has experience leading research into web services security, XML firewall configuration, and access control models in a service oriented architecture. Brandon has discovered numerous unpublished exploits based on vulnerabilities found in commercial products, web applications and messaging technologies. Additionally, Brandon actively participates in security research both on his own and with groups around the world, primarily with the focus of web application and core device vulnerability testing/discovery.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
