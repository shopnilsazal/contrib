recordingDate: 1432056496
description: "by: CJ Kihlborn and Jonas Nicklas\n\nWhile most Ruby developers are very familiar with testing their code, front end and JavaScript testing is still a new frontier for many. This talk will show you how to easily write and run JavaScript integration tests with Capybara and Cucumber, and unit tests with Evergreen and Jasmine. The goal is to inspire you to get started with frontend testing, and point you in the right direction to go do it!"
