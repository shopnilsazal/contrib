description: "RailsConf 2017: Sorting Rubyists by Caleb Thompson\n\nLet's take a peek under the hood of the magical \"sort\" method, learning algorithms... by sorting audience members wearing numbers! Intimidated by the word \"algorithm? Not sure what performance means? Confused by \"Big O Notation\"? Haven't even heard of best-, worst-, and average-case time complexities? No problem: we'll learn together! You can expect to come out knowing new things and with Benny Hill stuck in your head."
