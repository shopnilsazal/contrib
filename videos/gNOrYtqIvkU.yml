Wouldn't it begreat if those debug statements could just stay in your code forever? Like alittle gift that keeps on giving, not just for you, but for everyone else onyour team too.\n\nThat's what an application log is for! Logs aren't just for when things gowrong. They're for helping you to keep track of what's going on within yourapplication.\n\nWe take a look at how you can add helpful messages throughout your codebaseand leave them there, even in production! We'll cover common loggingstrategies, log aggregation and how to efficiently work with your logs to getthe data back out again.\n\nWe'll also take a look at metrics solutions such as Graphite that can helpaugment your logs to help work out what was going on by correlating event logswith peaks/drops in other monitoring systems.\n\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 17:00:00"
