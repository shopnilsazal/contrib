description: "I thought it's all about containers now - what are unikernels? Join this session to learn a bit about unikernels, what it's good at, and how to run a Java application with it!\n\nWith unikernel, you no longer need to wait for that long OS boot and initialization time, and get better-than-container level of security isolation, and resource isolation.\n\nIn this session, you'll learn about the different types of unikernels. We'll pick one, OSv unikernel, and: - Use its tool to build a Tomcat unikernel image - Use its tool to build a Spring Boot unikernel image - Running the unikernel application inside of KVM - Deploying the unikernel application to the cloud - Deploying and managing a cluster of them"
