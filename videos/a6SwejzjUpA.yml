description: "by: Enrique Comba Riepenhausen\n\nTo many rails applications suffer from ActiveRecorditis in their models. We expose the api of our domain to the other layers of the application (controllers and views) offering methods that have nothing to do with the domain we are modelling. Our problem?\n\nThe language we use is not the language our customers use!\n\nIn this talk I will be talking about the issues of naming and how you can (and should) avoid translating your customers language and write applications that map to your customers view of the world creating so a rich domain model which leads to simple to understand code without translating the language of your customer avoiding so The Towel of Babel."
