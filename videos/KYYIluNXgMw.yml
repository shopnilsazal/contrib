description: "Slides Here: https://defcon.org/images/defcon-22/dc-22-presentations/Schroeder/DEFCON-22-Will-Schroeder-Veil-Pillage-Post-Exploitation-2.0.pdf\n\nVeil-Pillage: Post-exploitation 2.0 \nWill Schroeder SECURITY RESEARCHER, VERIS GROUP \nThe Veil-Framework is a project that aims to bridge the gap between pentesting and red team toolsets. It began with Veil-Evasion, a tool to generate AV-evading payload executables, expanded into payload delivery with the release of Veil-Catapult, and branched into powershell functionality with the release of Veil-PowerView for domain situational awareness. This talk will unveil the newest additional to the Veil-Framework, Veil-Pillage, a fully-fledged, open-source post-exploitation framework that integrates tightly with the existing framework codebase.\n\nWe’ll start with a quick survey of the post-exploitation landscape, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of existing tools. We will cover current toolset gap areas, and how the lack of a single solution with all the options and techniques desired drove the development of Veil-Pillage. Major features of the framework will be quickly detailed, and the underlying primitives that modules build on will be explained.\n\nVeil-Pillage, released immediately following this presentation, makes it easy to implement the wealth of existing post-exploitation techniques out there, public or privately developed. Currently developed modules support a breadth of post-exploitation techniques, including enumeration methods, system management, persistence tricks, and more. The integration of various powershell post-exploitation components, assorted methods of hashdumping, and various ways to grab plaintext credentials demonstrate the operational usefulness of Veil-Pillage. The framework utilizes a number of triggering mechanisms with a preference toward stealth, contains complete command line flags for third-party integration, and has comprehensive logging and cleanup script capabilities. Welcome to Veil-Pillage: Post-Exploitation 2.0.\n\nWill Schroeder (@harmj0y) is a security researcher and pentester/red-teamer for Veris Group, and is one of the co-founders and active developers of the Veil-Framework, a project aimed at bridging the gap between pentesting and red-team toolsets. Will recently presented at Shmoocon ‘14 on AV-evasion and custom payload delivery methods utilizing tools he developed, Veil-Evasion and Veil-Catapult. He has presented at various BSides events on the Cortana attack scripting language and obfuscated Pyinstaller loaders. He is also the author of Veil-PowerView, a tool for gaining situational awareness on Windows domains, and is an active powershell hacker. A former national lab security researcher, he is happy to finally be in the private sector.\n\ntwitter: @harmj0y"
