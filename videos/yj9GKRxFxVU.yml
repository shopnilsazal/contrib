description: "In a new era of openness, and with the power of Roslyn to enable rapid prototyping, the C# team has been hard at work dreaming of new features for C# and discussing them with the community.\n\nThe precise shape of C# 7 is still somewhat up in the air, but we now have a Visual Studio 15 Preview, which gives us new language features to experiment with.\nCome and learn what the future has in store, with tuples, pattern matching, ref locals and ref returns, local functions, code generators and more. Language abuse will almost certainly take place - what's the point of having a new feature if you can't twist it horribly?"
