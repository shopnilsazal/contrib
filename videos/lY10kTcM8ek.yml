description: "RustConf 2016 - The /r/playrust Classifier: Real World Rust Data Science by Suchin Gururangan & Colin O'Brien\n\nModern machine learning systems require scalable, real-time processing to analyze massive datasets. Rust is an attractive tool to help drive low-cost, high performance data science. But what's it like to use Rust to solve machine learning problems in practice?\nTo evaluate Rust as a foundation for machine learning services, we built a classification system, entirely in Rust, that detects /r/playrust posts mistakenly published on the Rust subreddit. We'll present Rust's strengths and weaknesses at each step of the process, inspiring discussion on its role in the future of data science pipelines.\nThis is a two-speaker talk, also delivered by Colin O'Brien."
