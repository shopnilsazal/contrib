description: "Avi Bryant\n\nBrushfire is a framework for distributed, supervised learning of ensembles of decision trees. It is designed to be extremely scalable (both in number of observations and number of features) and extremely customizable: it makes heavy use of Scala generics and typeclasses to allow easy parameterization of each stage of the tree building algorithm. This talk will walk through the overall architecture and algorithm, then show some simple concrete examples of using Brushfire with Scalding to build trees on Hadoop.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FoG0/"
