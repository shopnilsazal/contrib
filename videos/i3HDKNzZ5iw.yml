recordingDate: 1435946282
description: 'Datomic decouples transaction, storage, and query, and puts query right in an application''s process. Sounds great from an architectural perspective, but how does that play out in our Clojure applications? In this talk we''ll look at the query, entity, and pull APIs, and the impact of local data on the development process and the resulting code.'
