description: "Early American board games offer some interesting insights on how culture can shape design. In this talk, Brooklyn-based game designer Julia Keren-Detar covers the rise of board games in America, their designers, and how the games reflected and were informed by the culture of their times. By looking at this relationship between culture and design, we can better understand why certain design decisions were made, and how this correlation impacted the board games we know today. As we take a retrospective journey to the beginning of gaming in America, we become better informed on how our current culture can shape the games we make now.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
