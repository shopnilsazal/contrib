description: "Full title: Don’t Learn, Don’t See, Don’t Run: Application Security for DevSecOps\n\nDevOps has not yet become DevSecOps, leaving DevOps insecure. What is preventing security from integration into DevOps and CI/CD? This presentation offers the answer. It defines capabilities that application security should adopt, explains how existing technologies should change, forecasts emerging technologies, and estimates the pace of application security transformation in the era of DevOps.\n\nIn this presentation, we prove a hypothesis that DevSecOps is in need of technologies with specific features &ndash; technologies that application development, operation, and security specialists don't have to learn, see, and run. Only these technologies will seamlessly integrate into DevOps, making it DevSecOps.\n\nAttendees of this session will learn what will come to the market within the next three years, how to plan adoption, and what will or will not work in the era when application security transforms to enable DevSecOps.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
