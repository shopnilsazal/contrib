description: "Description from DEF CON 9 Speaker’s Page: \n\nFor the past three years, Dr. Tafoya has been Professor of Criminal Justice at Governors State University. Previously he was Director of Research, Office of International Criminal Justice, University of Illinois at Chicago. He is a retired Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nFor 12 months (July 1989 - July 1990), he served as Congressional Research Fellow for the 101st Congress in Washington, DC. There he conducted research on police use of high technology as well as future crime. He remains the only law enforcement officer ever selected to serve in this capacity on behalf of the U. S. Congress. He has guest lectured at numerous universities and various venues internationally. In 1991 he founded the Society of Police Futurists International.\nPrior to his retirement from the FBI in June 1995, he was assigned in Washington, DC, Quantico, Virginia, and San Francisco, California. Dr. Tafoya served for 11 years at the FBI Academy as a senior faculty member of the Computer Crimes Training and Behavioral Science Units.\n\nHe was the first law enforcement officer to make investigative use of the Internet. He created the UNABOMber web site in December 1993. It was generated on a NASA computer because at that time the FBI did not have the capability to implement Bill’s ideas on its own computer system. Bill subsequently developed the FBI’s Oklahoma City Bombing web page in April 1995.\nAt Governors State University Dr. Tafoya teaches courses in Computer Crime Investigation, Research Methods and Statistics, as well as Strategic Planning. His current research interests are in CyberTerrorism and the application of Virtual Reality for training of law enforcement officers.\n\nHis 1986 Ph.D. in Criminology is from the University of Maryland; it was a forecast of future of law enforcement. He was recently appointed an advisor to the National Cybercrime Training Partnership of the U. S. Department of Justice. Both the print and electronic media have interviewed him extensively nationally and internationally. Twice he has been featured in U. S. News & World Report. More recently he was featured in the April 2001 issue of Information Security."
