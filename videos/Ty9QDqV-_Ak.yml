description: "http://www.oscon.com\nExperience the joy of flying the Parrot AR Drone using the power of Clojure.\n\nWe will take a journey that begins with a child's dream of having a \"real\" robot friend. Along the way, we will discover the blessings of a functional language, the power of the Clojure language, the thrill of flying with a REPL, and maybe even gems of wisdom long lost under the snow of the AI Winter.\n\nhttp://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/29559"
