description: "Just as TV developed a structure all its own, story designers for games must develop structures tailored to the unique needs of their story and gameplay. This GDC 2014 talk from Richard Rouse III and Tom Abernathy details some of the different structures employed in a variety of storytelling mediums, and explores the unique structural needs of games, providing designers and writers with the tools they need to tell stories as only games can.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
