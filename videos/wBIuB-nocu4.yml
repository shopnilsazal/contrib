description: "Simon Howard: Race-2-Zero Unpacked\nSignaure-based Antivirus is dead, we want to show you just how dead it is. This presentation will detail our findings from running the Race-2-Zero contest during DC16. The contest involves teams or individuals being given a sample set of malicious programs to modify and upload through the contest portal. The portal passes the modified samples through a number of antivirus engines and determines if the sample is a known threat. The first to pass their sample past all antivirus engines undetected wins that round. Each round increases in complexity as the contest progresses.\n\nTopics covered will include:\n\nAn overview of the multi-AV engine interface\nMutation / obfuscation techniques\nStatistical analysis of the time taken to circumvent various products\nDifferent approaches used by contestants\nWere viruses or exploits easier to obfuscate?\n\nPrize giving ceremony with celeb judging panel... prizes will be awarded for\n\nThe most elegant solution\nComedy value\nDirtiest hack\n... and most deserving of a beer\n\nSimon Howard With a penchant for black t-shirts, jeans and the lyrical styling of Pantera, Simon has been touching computers ever since he can remember. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
