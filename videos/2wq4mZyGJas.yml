description: "Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. It provides elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of D3.js without having to write any JS. Attendees will learn how to get set up with Bokeh, key library and plotting concepts, how to plot basic glyphs, use high-level charts, style visualizations, configure plot tools, layer multiple plots, add interactions, deploy with the bokeh-server and embed plots in your applications. The tutorial will include notebooks and python scripts with exercises that will be solved during the session, with the aim of making the tutorial hands-on and interactive for attendees.The talk is aimed at Web developers, Data Scientists and Python programmers interested in data visualizations for the browser. Advanced beginner or intermediate python skills would be nice to have to get the most out of the tutorial.\n\nChristine Doig"
