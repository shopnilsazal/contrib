language: French
recordingDate: 1525249449
description: "JDK 9 was released in September 2017 and includes many changes to the Java platform. The biggest is the Java Platform Module System (often referred to as Project Jigsaw). This breaks up the existing rt.jar file into 97 modules but also encapsulates internal APIs, such as sun.misc.Unsafe that have previously been accessible to developers.\n\nIn this session, we'll start with a brief overview of what's new in JDK 9 including details of JPMS. From there we'll move onto how this, as well as other changes, impact application migration from earlier versions of Java.\n\nOracle made several announcements about how OpenJDK will be developed moving forward, so we'll explain what these changes are and how they impact decisions about which versions of Java to use for application deployment.\n\nWe'll close with a brief look at the range of new features and projects being planned for future versions of Java to ensure that it remains the most popular development platform on the planet."
