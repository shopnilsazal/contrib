description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nApache OpenWhisk on Kubernetes: Building a Production-Ready Serverless Stack on and for Kubernetes - David Grove, IBM Research (Any Skill Level)\n\nApache OpenWhisk is a serverless, open source cloud platform that executes functions in response to events at any scale. OpenWhisk can now be deployed on Kubernetes, providing a compelling unified platform for a wide range of cloud-native applications. In this talk, David Grove will describe the challenges of deploying a production-ready, multi-tenant, low-latency and high-volume Functions-as-a-Service offering on Kubernetes. He will outline how OpenWhisk's architecture maps to Kubernetes, and motivate OpenWhisk's bespoke container management strategy for low-latency function invocation via an empirical evaluation of the alternatives. David will also demonstrate how OpenWhisk deployed on Kubernetes provides a compelling runtime platform for executing hybrid applications that seamlessly mix OpenWhisk functions, Kubernetes-managed services, and external services.\n\nAbout David\nDavid Grove is a technical leader of the Apache OpenWhisk sub-project to deploy OpenWhisk on Kubernetes. He is a Distinguished Research Staff Member at IBM Research and a committer for the Apache OpenWhisk incubator project. He was named an ACM Fellow in 2012 for his contributions to programming languages and for the development of open-source research infrastructures."
