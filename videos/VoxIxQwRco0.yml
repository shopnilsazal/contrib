recordingDate: 1400079544
description: "By Jason Roelofs\n\nDevOps is a fascinating, quickly growing field. With Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Salt, Packer, Docker, Vagrant, AWS, and others, there are many ways to get an infrastructure up and running. However, it is quickly evident to those entering this field that choosing one tool often excludes all others or requires significant investment in custom development to fit the chosen tool(s) into the intended infrastructure. In this talk I'll be introducing Pantry, a tool-agnostic provisioning service we've been building and running at Collective Idea. Pantry's job is to facilitate communication between developers and their infrastructure, ease the burden on setting up new infrastructure, and to allow seamless use of multiple DevOps tools together. I will be talking about how Pantry came to be, the ideas and technology it uses, the problems Pantry solves for us at Collective Idea and what the future will bring.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0u/"
