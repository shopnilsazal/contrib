description: "Nobuyoshi Nakada is the most prolific contributor to Ruby. He is the all time leader in commits to the CRuby source code. With over 10,000 commits, he leads second place by double the number of commits. Leading to his psuedonym \"Patch Monster\".\n\nAllow me to introduce you to the man, the myth, and the legend that is nobu.\n\nYou will learn the true story of how nobu came to be, and witness exactly how he earned that psuedonym and why everyone loves nobu.\n\nWe will also show you what it takes to make it in ruby-core using nobu as an example.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Fqsx/"
