description: "Products may be or become complex for many reasons, and teams are often asked to make them \"simpler and better.\" \n\nHow do we identify when and why something is complex, and how can we make it simpler? We'll talk about methods to make products and experiences simpler, some of the considerations and decisions we may face when tackling complexity, and look at some examples of products that made themselves simpler without sacrificing features and functionality."
