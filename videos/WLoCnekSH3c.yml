description: "By Eric Hodel\nMaintaining RubyGems, RDoc and other Ruby libraries has grown from a hobby to my full time job over the past six years. Working on and maintaining open source projects has brought me lots of fun and enjoyment. I'll cover the joy and pain of being an open source developer, strategies for maintaining both your project and the interest and happiness you derive from it. I'll also talk about some of the things that keep me motivated to continue working on open source.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0r/"
