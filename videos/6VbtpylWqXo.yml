description: "by Etiene Dalcol\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nNodeMCU is an open hardware IoT platform based on eLua for the ESP8266microcontroller. It allows creating low-cost projects using Wi-Fi and easyscripting in Lua, which makes it great for making wearables, for example. Inthis talk I'll give an introduction to the platform, show how I built an audioreactive graduation dress and share the materials to get you started on yourown wearable project. This talk is ideal for beginners to hardware hacking orLua enthusiasts looking for project inspiration.\n\n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 11:15:00"
