description: "RubyConf 2016 - Lies, Damned Lies, and Substrings by Haseeb Qureshi\n\nGenerate all of the substrings of a stringâ€”a classic coding problem. But what's its time complexity? In many languages this is a pretty straightforward question, but in Ruby it turns out, it depends.\n\nFollow me into the matrix as I explore copy-on-write optimization, how substrings are created in MRI, and eventually create a custom build of Ruby to try to speed up this classic coding problem. This talk will be a mix of computer science and a deep dive into how Ruby strings work in MRI."
