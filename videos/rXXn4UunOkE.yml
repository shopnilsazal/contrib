description: "http://www.codemesh.io/\nVerifying Stateful and Side-effecting Programs using Dependent Types\n\nDependent types allow us to express a program's behaviour precisely in its type, meaning that type checking is equivalent to formally and mechanically checking a program's correctness. Introductory examples typically involve length preserving operations on lists, or ordering invariants on sorting. Realistically, though, programming is not so simple: programs interact with users, communicate over networks, manipulate state, deal with erroneous input, and so on. In this talk I will show how advanced type systems allow us to express such interactions precisely, and how they support verification of stateful systems as a result. As examples, I will show simple communication protocols, and a word game (Hangman), in the Idris programming language.\n\nTalk objectives: I aim to show that, with a sufficiently expressive type system, writing a correct program ought to be easier than writing an incorrect program!\n\nTarget audience: Developers interested in type systems, software correctness, or programming language research in general. Some ability to read (but not necessarily write) a functional language such as Haskell or OCaml will be assumed."
