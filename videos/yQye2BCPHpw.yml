description: "How Teaching Kids to Code Made Me a Better Developer by Ramón Huidobro\n\nKids have this magical ability to take something you think you understand well and turn it upside down within an instant. They challenge norms and ask questions that you never thought existed or could be asked.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll go over some of the challenges I faced introducing kids to the world of programming, and how their inquisitiveness changed the way I look at software development, how I learn to get better at it and finally, how it boosted my confidence in my code. Teaching anyone is a rewarding, learning experience, and it motivated me to become active in the community."
