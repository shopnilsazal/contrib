description: "Java does not provide an API to directly support the expressiveness and power of SQL. All attention is given to object-relational mapping and abstractions on a higher level, such as OQL, HQL, JPQL, CriteriaQuery.\n\njOOQ is a dual-licensed Open Source product filling this gap. It implements SQL itself as a type safe domain-specific language in Java.\n\njOOQ is a good choice in a Java application where SQL and its proprietary features of the database in use are important. It shows, how a modern domain-specific language can greatly increase developer productivity, internalising SQL into Java."
