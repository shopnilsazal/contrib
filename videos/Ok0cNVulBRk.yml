Novak Assistant Director, Digital Forensics; Stroz Friedberg, LLC\nAndrea (Drea) London Digital Forensic Examiner; Stroz Friedberg, LLC\n\nIn 2011, SQL injections became front page news as ever more high profile companies were victims of automated SQL injection attacks. Responders spent countless hours looking at values in log files like \"0x31303235343830303536\" trying to figure out what was being exfiltrated by whom. Incident response costs skyrocketed while the cost of attacking fell.\n\nThis presentation will debut SQL ReInjector, a tool for the rapid assessment of logs from SQL injection attacks to determine what data was exfiltrated.\n\nWhen responding to an SQL injection attack, responders have to determine what was exfiltrated by manually parsing the web server logs from the victimized host. This is a time consuming process that requires a significant amount of a responder's time. Moreover, manual replay of the SQL injection does not account for system level discrepancies in how queries are executed by the system - running SQL against a SQL server directly doesn't account for the behavior of any intermediary systems - e.g. any application layer logic or nuances in how the web application and database server interact.\n\nSQL ReInjector uses the log files from the machine that has been subject to a SQL injection attack to replay the attack against the server (or a virtualized forensic image thereof) and captures the data returned by the SQL injection web site requests, reducing the amount of time responders have to spend looking at web server logs and allows for responders to recreate the data exfiltrated through a SQL injection attack.\n\n\n\nJason A. Novak is an Assistant Director of Digital Forensics in Stroz Friedberg's Chicago office. At Stroz Friedberg, Mr. Novak has been lead examiner in a wide range of cases involving digital forensics, incident response, application testing, source code analysis, and data analytics, and has developed numerous tools to expedite the firm's analysis and response capabilities. The proprietary tools developed by Mr. Novak have included: an anti-money laundering data analytics platform and tools to process electronically stored information to respond to forensic and electronic discovery requests. As a co-writer of the Google Street View report, Mr. Novak analyzed the source code to gstumbler, the WiFi device geolocation application used by Google as part of the Street View project, and documented its structure and functionality in a publicly released report; Mr. Novak has responded to inquiries about the report from domestic and foreign regulators.\nTwitter: @strozfriedberg\nhttp://www.strozfriedberg.com\n\nAndrea (Drea) London is a Digital Forensic Examiner in Stroz Friedberg's Dallas office.
