description: "Alexey Zaslavsky, Software Engineer @ WebbyLab\n\nNowadays React.js can be used to render UIs in different environments (e.g. DOM, mobile and terminal). Recent experiments revealed a possibility to control an Arduino board with React. In my talk, I will expand the device area and show an approach to control a few wirelessly connected IoT devices using a custom React renderer.\n\nJoin us on meetup.com: https://www.meetup.com/Kyiv-ReactJS-Meetup/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/reactkyiv\nTelegram chat: https://telegram.me/reactkyiv"
