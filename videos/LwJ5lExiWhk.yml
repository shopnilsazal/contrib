recordingDate: 1266147221
description: "by Benjamin Zores\r\n\r\nEnna is GeeXboX's next generation Media Center interface, built upon Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). It allows you to listen to your music files, watch your favorite movies, TV shows and photos across your network. It relies on libplayer multimedia A/V abstraction framework to control your preferred player and libvalhalla, a fast media scanner API that will grab metadata (covers, fan arts, song lyrics and so many more) from your multimedia contents. \r\n\r\nGeeXboX is a free embedded Linux distribution which aims at turning your computer into a so called HTPC (Home Theater PC) or Media Center. The GeeXboX project features both a LiveCD distribution and a standalone media center application (Enna); the project developed also several libraries (libplayer, libvalhalla) to enhance the multimedia experience under GNU/Linux. \r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nâ—¦http://www.geexbox.org/ \r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development.
