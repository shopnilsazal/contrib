I will NOT be teaching object orientation principles in general - this video series is for you if youâ€™re already pretty familiar with object orientation, but confused around how it works in JavaScript specifically. At the end of this series, youâ€™ll be a lot less confused about the prototype, classes, bind,  Object.create, modules, factories, constructors and so on.\n\nObject Creation in JavaScript\nhttps://goo.gl/KFeTFN\n\nHigher-order functions in JavaScript\nhttps://goo.gl/3aTDR6"
