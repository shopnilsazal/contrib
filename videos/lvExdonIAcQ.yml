description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/materials/ \n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT: \n\nBehind every successful exploit is a good delivery mechanism. This talk combines my research in exploit writing, browser and PDF exploitation, web hacking and old school data representation techniques, bringing you a slew of creative and innovative tricks and techniques to send exploits successfully to the victim's doorstep.\n\nNever before has the fine art of packaging been more important when it comes to exploit delivery. Advances in HTML standards, newer trends with HTTP, new techniques of consuming web resources and multiple ways of data representation make it possible to come up with tricks like \"Javascript chameleons\", \"shortened exploits\", \"exploitation by painting\" and other creative techniques.\n\nAs usual, we shall have interesting demos, rants, sarcasm, heckling and the occasional intelligent debate!\n\nABOUT SAUMIL SHAH\n\nSaumil continues to lead the efforts in e-commerce security research and product development at Net-Square.
