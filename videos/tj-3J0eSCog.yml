recordingDate: 1384985872
description: "The Year In Computer Crime Cases\nJennifer Granick Civil Liberties Director, EFF\n\nIts been a booming year for computer crime cases as cops and civil litigants have pushed the envelope to go after people using fake names on social networking sites (the MySpace suicide case), researchers giving talks at DEFCON (MBTA v. Anderson), and students sending email to other students (the Calixte/Boston College case). The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been front and center in these cases, either filing amicus briefs or directly representing the coders and speakers under attack. At this presentation, Jennifer Granick and other EFF lawyers fresh from the courtroom will share war stories about these cases, thereby informing attendees about the latest developments in computer security law and giving pointers about how to protect yourselves from overbroad legal challenges.\n\nJennifer Granick is the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Before EFF, Granick was a Lecturer in Law and Executive Director of the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School where she taught Cyberlaw and Computer Crime Law. She practices in the full spectrum of Internet law issues including computer crime and security, national security, constitutional rights, and electronic surveillance, areas in which her expertise is recognized nationally. Before teaching at Stanford, Jennifer spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California. She was selected by Information Security magazine in 2003 as one of 20 \"Women of Vision\" in the computer security field. She earned her law degree from University of California, Hastings College of the Law and her undergraduate degree from the New College of the University of South Florida.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
