title: 'Marcos Vanetta: Reproducibility of your development environment'
recordingDate: 1449251030
description: "PyData NYC 2015\n\n\"Reproducible\" is not a new word in science, but it can be a surprise for newcomers that they also need to have reproducible software environments. What was working yesterday may not work today, but there is a way to prevent that and that's what we are going to explore. We will take a sneak peek at different open source solutions to help maintain a reproducible, shareable environment.\n\nI will define a reproducible development environment while getting input from the audience. We will consider programming language, dependencies, services, database engines, and data while coming up with this definition.\nI will introduce open source solutions and best practices to specify environments. I will talk about conda, virtualenv, pyenv, etc. And I'll describe tools like docker or SaaS solutions to have reproducible environments.\nI will present tools to publish environments like Anaconda.org and Github.\n\nSlides available here: http://www.slideshare.net/malev/reproducibility-of-your-development-environment"
