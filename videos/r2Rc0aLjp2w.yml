description: "Description from DEF CON 9 Speakerâ€™s Page:\n\nKIS - kernel Intrusion System\n\nThis is the release of KIS.  KIS is a self contained binary that when executed on a system installs itself so that it will be loaded on reboot and loads a kernel module.  This LKM hides itself, all of its subprocesses or desired processes, all of their files, directories, and network connections automatically. The presentation will consist of demonstrating how to setup and use KIS as well as explain some of the basic design concepts.\n\nOptyx is a programmer, age 20, currently living in san francisco, california."
