description: "Adam Nowaczyk  \nPassionate coder, founder of Acaisoft (http://acaisoft.com)\n\nAdam refers to himself differently, full-stack software engineer, language agnostic coder, long talker. Either the way, he loves coding and has been doing that since he was too young to remember, although always finding time for other pleasures too. He's started Acaisoft to be able to pursue the most technologically challenging projects, not always the most profitable. Still making too many stupid mistakes, possibly due to lack of proper unit testing, but practice makes perfect as they say. Now trying to share gathered knowledge with Others.\n\n\nAngular 2 and WebSockets\nIs Angular 2 and WebSocket a good mariage?\nIs it good alternative to REST API approach?\nLet's try answering it by building example app step by step.\nLive coding, real action, we'll be back :D."
