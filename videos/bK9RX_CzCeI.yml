description: "RubyConf 2016 - Attention Rubyists: you can write video games by Cory Chamblin\n\nRuby may seem like a humdrum language best suited for writing web apps, but underneath that cool exterior lies plenty of power -- power we can harness for making our own games!\n\nIn this talk, we'll introduce Gosu, a sweet little game library. We'll talk about how games are structured in pretty much every language and framework ever, where to get ideas for things to make, and ways you can share your game with your friends and the world."
