description: "\"Playing the Certification Game (No Straitjacket Required), a.k.a How to Become Certified Without Becoming Certifiable\", by Dru Lavigne, iXsystems, PC-BSD Project, FreeNAS Project, FreeBSD Foundation, BSD Certification Group\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this video are those of the speaker(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the USENIX Association.**\r\n\r\nThis presentation provides a slightly tongue-in-cheek overview of the good, the bad, and the ugly of system administration certifications. Drawing upon her experience as a certificant, trainer, and chair of a certifying organization, the presenter will provide examples of how not to create a certification program, what to look for in a certification program in order to advance one's career, and how to spend one's training dollars wisely while possibly even learning some new skills along the way."
