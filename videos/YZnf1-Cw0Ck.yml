description: "PyData Seattle 2017\n\nKatie Porterfield | BrainDrain: Using Machine Learning and Brain Waves to Detect Errors in Human Problem Solving\n\nThe Muse Headband is a simple to use EEG machine. Using this headband, a python model was developed using big data and machine learning techniques to interpret brain wave patterns to create a feedback system that helps the user understand their cognitive thinking while solving a problem.\n\nAs more medical devices become cheaper and readily available to the public, they can be used in everyday life. The Muse Headband is an EEG machine that provides realtime measurements of brain waves. This talk will discuss the process of gathering and cleaning the data from the headband, using Keras to develop a model, and creating a basic real-time feedback end user program.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
