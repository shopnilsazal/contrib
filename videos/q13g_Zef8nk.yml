description: "C# 7.0 has been out for a while now - but how well do you know it? With tuples, decomposition, pattern matching, ref locals, ref returns, local methods and more, there's a lot to learn.\n\nIn this session I'll conduct a tour of all of the new features, as well as looking at when I've found them useful in real code.\n\nDon't miss Bill Wagner's talk following this one, covering C# 7.1, 7.2 and beyond!"
