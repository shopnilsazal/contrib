title: 'Uber Marketplace Meetup: Using Distributed Locking to Build Reliable Systems'
language: English
recordingDate: 1506986867
description: "To make our systems more consistent, Uber Engineering implements distributed locking at all stages of a trip’s lifecycle. During Uber’s Marketplace Meetup on August 24, 2017, Brandon Layton, an engineer on Uber’s Dispatch Core team, introduces Ringpop and Distributed Lock Manager (DLM), two solutions built to achieve locking (and as a result, greater reliability) on our platform. Open sourced in early 2016, Ringpop is a Node.js library that facilitates greater cooperation and coordination among distributed applications, and Distributed Lock Manager is a decentralized locking interface for applications that does not need to shard clusters to guarantee locking. \n\nLearn more about Ringpop on our Eng Blog: https://eng.uber.com/intro-to-ringpop/\n\nGet started with Ringpop by visiting the Uber Engineering GitHub page: https://uber.github.io/ringpop/ \n\nLearn more about Uber Marketplace: https://www.uber.com/marketplace"
