description: "The Not So Rational Programmer by Laura Eck\n\nCognitive biases are heuristics that the brain uses to process information and quickly come up with decisions. They are generally pretty useful, but they aren’t perfect processes and can often lead to suboptimal decisions or behaviors.\n\nThis talk will help you to recognize their patterns in your thinking and behavior and (since we unfortunately can’t quite de-bug our own brains yet) to monkey-patch them - in order to become a more efficient, more cooperative and ultimately more successful developer."
