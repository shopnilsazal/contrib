description: "For all e-commerce sites, marketing is a big part of the business and marketing efficiency and effectiveness are critical to their success. Companies must make many data-driven decisions in order to reach customers that their competitors donâ€™t, maximize the revenue of each click, decide wisely what are the costs to cut, enter new markets, etc.GetYourGuide has been working for more than two years on building a marketing intelligence that allows us growing our marketing efforts in the travel market without building a huge team or buying extremely expensive tools.All the decisions are supported by a dedicated system that runs on the PyData stack that allows marketers to extract valuable insights from data and performs critical marketing tasks: keyword mining, campaign automation, predictive modeling, omni-channel marketing data integration, customer segmentation, pattern mining from click data, etc.As a result of this, we were able to scale up 3 times our marketing efforts, launch campaigns in 13 markets and automate 75% of our work only in the last 8 months. But this is not the end of our journey, GetYourGuide is building a Data Science team to understand travelers needs and wants and make our Customers' trips amazing.\n\nJose Luis Lopez Pino"
