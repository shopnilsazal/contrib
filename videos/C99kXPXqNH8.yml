description: "As Rubyists, we depend on open source software to power large portions of our applications. Ruby is free and open source. High-quality frameworks like Rails are free and open source. Gems are ubiquitous.\n\nYet there are rumblings that Rubyists take more than they give. And open source requires giving.\n\nIn this talk, we'll reflect on the immensely positive impact of open source software. We'll also reflect on why it's necessary and worthwhile to give back. Finally, we'll close with some practical suggestions on how to get involved.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8B/"
