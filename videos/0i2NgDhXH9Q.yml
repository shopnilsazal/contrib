description: "What If... ?: Ruby 3 by Eric Weinstein\n\nWhat if Professor X and Magneto formed the X-Men together? What if Jessica Jones had joined the Avengers? What if Tony Stark wrote Ruby? (Okay, I made that last one up, but we'd probably all read it.) This talk, in the mode of Marvel's What if... ? comics, explores what Ruby 3 might look like if key decisions in its history had been (or might be) made differently. We'll look at three \"what if\"s in particular: \"what if Ruby had a static type system?\", \"what if Ruby ran in the browser?\", and \"what if Ruby didn't have a global interpreter lock?\""
