description: "Julian Berman - Just Because You Can, Doesn't Mean You Should\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nPython is a powerful language that provides many tools for creating\nhighly dynamic programs. It offers tools all across the complexity\nspectrum that library authors can use to make their libraries seem\nconvenient to use for users.\n\nWhile it's true that there are a wealth of techniques with huge\npositive benefits, there are a number of common antipatterns which can\ndeceptively cause a net-loss in flexibility, readability, and\npredictability for users.\n\nWe'll explore a few specific commonalities in this area of library and\nobject API design, and talk about the ramifications they have on each\nof these programmer concerns."
