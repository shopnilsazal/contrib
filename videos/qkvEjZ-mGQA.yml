description: "Over the past few years, Nokogiri has slowly eclipsed older XML parsing libraries to garner nearly 10 million downloads from rubygems.org.\nBut why another XML parsing library? Isn't it boring? And what does \"nokogiri\" mean in Japanese, anyway?\nThese questions will be answered, and I'll do a brief dive into all the technologies that we use to make Nokogiri a fast, reliable and robust gem. Topics will include:\nOrigins of the project: motivation, problems and impact\nNative C and Java extensions\nFFI, and how to know if it's Right For You\nDebugging tools (valgrind, perftools)\nPackaging tools (mini_portile, rake-compiler)\nInstallation issues, and what we're doing to help\nFeature roadmap\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG99/"
