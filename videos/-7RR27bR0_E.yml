description: "By, Aja Hammerly\nIn Ruby, assignment is our primary tool. By contrast, functional programming makes much less use of assignment and mutation. Instead techniques like function composition, recursion, and anonymous functions are used.\n\nDespite being OO, Ruby accommodates pure functional approaches. This talk will demonstrate how tasks can be accomplished without assignment. Ruby and Scheme will be used for examples. I'll also discuss some of the great resources available for those interested in digging deeper into functional programming.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FrUU/"
