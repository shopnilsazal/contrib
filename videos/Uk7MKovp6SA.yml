title: 'Managing User Feedback - Modupe Akinnawonu'
recordingDate: 1525329675
description: "Developers have multiple opportunities to publicly engage with their users, whether it’s through reviews in the Google Play Store, public beta and alpha channels, or through social media. But sometimes these interactions create situations that are more fraught than necessary, and these moments can lead to features that users say they want, but then don’t use.\n\nIn this session, I will use The New York Times as a case study for how to interact with users in public forums, showing you how to leverage this two-way relationship to increase their satisfaction with your apps. I will also dive into ways that developers can translate user feedback into an understanding of core user needs, helping you build more effective solutions to their reported problems and feature requests."
