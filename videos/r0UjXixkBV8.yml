description: "RubyConf 2016 - Methods of Memory Management in MRI by Aaron Patterson\n\nLet's talk about MRI's GC! In this talk we will cover memory management algorithms in MRI. We will cover how objects are allocated and how they are freed. We will start by looking at Ruby's memory layout, including page allocation and object allocations within those pages. Next we'll cover collection algorithms used by MRI starting with the mark and sweep algorithm, followed by generational collection, and the tri color abstraction. Finally we'll cover experimental developments for the GC like heap splitting. Expect to leave this talk with heaps of pointers to add to your remembered set!"
