description: "Voice Controlled Home Automation in Ruby by Jeff Sacks\n\nHave you ever wanted to change the channel on your TV but the remote was missing? Wouldn't it be great to tell your TV to change the channel by speaking to it? In this talk, you will learn how to control your TV with nothing but your voice. Using Ruby you can connect your TV and cable box with the Amazon Echo, AWS Lambda, and a Raspberry Pi. Once you learn how easy this is to setup, you'll never look for that missing remote again."
