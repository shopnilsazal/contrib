description: 'Personalization and Scalable Deep Learning with MXNET: User return times and movie preferences are inherently time dependent. In this talk I will show how this can be accomplished efficiently using deep learning by employing an LSTM (Long Short Term Model). Moreover, I will show how to train large scale distributed parallel models using MXNet efficiently. This includes a brief overview of key components of defining networks, of optimization, and a walkthrough of the steps required to allocate machines, and to train a model.'
