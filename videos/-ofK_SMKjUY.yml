description: "PyData London 2018\n\nOptimisation is at the heart of many mathematical models (including most ML algorithms), but it's often overlooked as an implementation detail. Conversely, developing an appreciation for optimisation techniques leads to a better understanding of their impact on these applications.\n\nThis workshop provides a comprehensive overview of continuous optimisation, with a practical ML focus.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/gcampanella/pydata-london-2018\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
