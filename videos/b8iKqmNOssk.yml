description: "Description\nWe will show several interesting examples of data science and machine learning techniques solving real-life business issues for customers of SAS Institute. Within this context, we will also demonstrate how SAS analytics platform and Python can work together.\n\nAbstract\nFor those who say that business applications of data science are boring, I will try to show that quite the opposite is true :-)\n\nWithin this short presentation I will demonstrate use cases where ordinary tasks, such as revenue optimization, can become more inviting. We will briefly see:\n\n- data from thousands of trucks analyzed in real-time,\n- deep neural networks analyzing telco data,\n- and more...\nFinally, I will show how Python and SAS can work together to make it happen.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
