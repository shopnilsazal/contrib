description: "In this 2015 GDC talk, game marketers Joel Dreskin and Justin Woodward provide expert advice from two perspectives: a marketer who's driven launches for both high-profile/high-budget releases and smaller enthusiast games, and an indie who's been heavily involved in the community, notably through his own game, to help you get your game in front of more players. \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
