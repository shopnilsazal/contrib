description: "Dan O'Boyle, Stack Overflow\n@selfcommit\n\nDo you encrypt secrets before committing them to a repository?\n\nAre API keys and passwords stored in a local library any team member can decrypt?\n\nAre you forced to re-encrypt all secrets anytime access has changed?\n\nStop doing those things! Cloud Based Key Management Services (Google KMS, Azure Key Vault, Amazon KMS) provide encryption keys as a service. KMS create a centralized access control list. Using a KMS, you can centralize secrets, removing them from local libraries. Key rotation can be automated, often times making a KMS more secure than local key management practices.\n\nView the full LISA17 program: https://www.usenix.org/lisa17/program"
