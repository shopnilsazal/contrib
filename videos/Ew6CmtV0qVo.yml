description: "By Victor Stinner\r\n\r\nThe talk will present how a fuzzer is written and how it works. Then we will analyze a crash. And finally we will see how to report it to the vendor and typical vendor reactions.\r\n\r\nFusil the fuzzer is a Python library to write fuzzers and a collection of twenty specific fuzzers: ClamAV, Firefox, mplayer, poppler (PDF), etc. A simple fuzzer can crash most (all?) applications.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
