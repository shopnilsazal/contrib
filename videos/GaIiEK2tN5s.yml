description: "Secure coding and verification practices within the software development lifecycle are paramount to producing secure software. Every team has unique requirements, motivations, and technologies requiring preparation and iteration to achieve DevOps nirvana. We must consider and shape our organization's security policy, development platform, application technical stack, cross-team involvement, and most importantly secure software practices.\n\nThe key questions are:\n\n* How to assess the current state?\n* Where are the productivity bottlenecks?\n* Whom to train on what?\n* What and how to measure?\n* Finally How to monitor?\n\nOrgs leveraging a custom, integrated development pipeline can increase security assurance along with other quality attributes such as quality, performance, and regulatory compliance. In this session, we will share our considerations and approach to discovering the proper requirements for a security-first automated development pipeline implementation in your organization\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
