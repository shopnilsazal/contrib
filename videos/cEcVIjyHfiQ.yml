title: 'Record linkage: Join for real life by Rhydwyn Mcguire'
recordingDate: 1407559280
description: "In an ideal world, you can join on candidate keys, names are never misspelt, people never move house, and I have a pony. I donâ€™t have a pony. But we do have record linkage. \r\n\r\nRecord linkage (also known as data linkage or fuzzy record matching) is a naive Bayes algorithm which matches data about individuals across databases or within a single database, by constructing the probabilities that two records apply to the same individual or to different individuals.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will discuss the techniques of record linkage in Python, the usefulness and the limitations of linkage, and the effect that this technique is having on healthcare research in particular.\r\n\r\nHealthcare/epidemiology studies often require data from more than one source, and individuals frequently have multiple interactions with a data set without a unique identifier. The outcomes of these studies are only as good as the record linkage which underlies them, so the ways in which record linkage is done can have a direct impact on our ability to understand, prevent and treat serious medical conditions.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nAugust 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
