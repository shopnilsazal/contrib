description: "Why So Angry, Soo? Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love Public Speaking by Soo Choi\n\nPublic speaking is hard and this talk is about how I overcome that fear. I avoided public speaking for years. Whenever I speak, people compare me to Gordon Ramsay: I can’t not sound angry even though I’m not. But I had a recent breakthrough and I want to share this journey with you. There’s a lesson for everyone in this talk as we examine the role of women in tech, challenges of travel, tech conferences, the DevOps community, and more."
