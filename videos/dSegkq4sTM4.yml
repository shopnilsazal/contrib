title: 'Kerrighed: Flexible distributed checkpoint/restart'
recordingDate: 1266146687
description: "by Matthieu Fertre\r\n\r\nProcess checkpoint consists in saving the state of a running process, so that the process can be restarted at any time later. Uses include fault tolerance, job suspend that frees memory resources, process live-migration across physical machines. Checkpoint services may checkpoint only single processes as well as full operating systems with processes, file systems, socket states, etc. This talk will present Kerrighed's application checkpoint/restart and show its advantages in flexibility over other checkpoint services. \r\n\r\nKerrighed is a Single System Image operating system for clusters. It offers the view of a unique SMP machine on top of a cluster of standard PCs. \r\n\r\nKerrighed is implemented as an extension to the Linux operating system (a set of modules and a patch to the kernel). Current development version is based on Linux 2.6.30. \r\n\r\nMain available features are: \r\n\r\n◦Cluster wide process management with customizable load balancing over the cluster (through process migration and remote forking) \r\n◦Cluster wide shared memory \r\n◦Application checkpointing \r\n◦Node addition/removal\r\nLinks:\r\n◦http://www.kerrighed.org \r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
