description: "By Mando Escamilla\n\nOnce you've properly structured your Rails app, you'll begin to find logical seams in your domain logic. These seams can be the perfect opportunity to extract a software component into a stand-alone service. \n\nUsing a live-in-production example, we'll walk through how we build and integrate services at Union Metrics. We'll go over some tips and patterns we've discovered as well as about some of the pitfalls and things to avoid when building and deploying stand-alone services.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG3u/"
