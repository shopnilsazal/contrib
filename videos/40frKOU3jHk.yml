description: "Ever wondered if there was such thing as a “hacker-friendly” member of Congress? We found some and convinced them to come to DEF CON so you can meet them too! In this first-of-its-kind DEF CON session, two of the most hacker-friendly Congress critters will join DEF CON for an engaging and interactive session with the security research community.\n\nJoin the Atlantic Council’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative for a candid discussion with Representatives Will Hurd (R-TX) and James Langevin (D-RI). The two Congressmen will share their thoughts on the latest developments in cybersecurity policymaking on the Hill and provide a unique opportunity for the audience to ask questions, exchange ideas, and maybe even answer some of the Congressmen’s questions."
