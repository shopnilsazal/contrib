recordingDate: 1494315507
description: "This year for the Salone del Mobile at frog, we came up with a funky experiment, based on Drones, Android, and VR.\n\nIn this talk, your hosts will walk you through our Drone Race experiment, touching topics like real-time computer vision, reactive programming for mobile, indoor positioning and (wheeled) Drones hacking.\n\nThe variety and complexity of these topics is equal to its coolness though, so you may be puzzled asking yourself: “Where do I start?”\nWe will share experiences and lots of code, so that you can start right away."
