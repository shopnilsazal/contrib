description: "Speaker : Yufeng Guo (Google)\n\nIn this talk, we will go on an adventure to build a machine learning model that combines the benefits of linear regression models with deep neural networks. You will also gain some intuition about what is happening under the hood, and learn how you can use this model for your own datasets"
