description: "The context package offers some great features that any go programmer can take advantage of to build great apps. However, it can be a little tricky when you first pick it up to understand the ins and outs of how to use it and when to use it. \n\nThis talk was one simple goal, to show how the to use the context package in your programs. We'll walk through the context package and how we can use it to make our go programs simpler and easier to manage. \n\nWe'll look at examples and real code using context to demonstrate the everyday use cases that we may encounter and how to support them."
