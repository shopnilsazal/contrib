title: 'DEF CON 17 - Sean Taylor - Binary Obfuscation from the Top Down'
recordingDate: 1384933286
description: "Binary Obfuscation from the Top-Down: Obfuscating Executables Without Writing Assembly\nSean \"Frank^2\" Taylor Security Engineer, Rapid7\n\nBinary obfuscation is commonly applied in malware and by software vendors in order to frustrate the efforts of reverse engineers to understand the underlying code. A common misconception is one must be a master of assembly in order to properly obfuscate a binary. However, with knowledge of compiler optimizations and certain keywords, one can frustratingly obfuscate their binary simply by writing specifically crafted high-level code. This talk will attempt to teach an array of methods that can be employed to obfuscate a binary as it is compiled rather than afterward. Knowledge of C/C++ is the only prerequisite for this talk.\n\nSean Taylor is a candidate for a BS in Computer Science at Cal Poly Pomona. In his spare time he can be found trying to take apart various pieces of malware or tinkering with a personal project. He is one of the architects of TwatFS-- the Twitter file system-- created by DC949 and has helped develop other (perhaps questionable) tools for Twitter.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
