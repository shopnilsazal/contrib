I would like to share my journey with the PyData community - purely to give something back, as I have learned so much out of the meetups.\n\nMy talk would include takeaways, patterns, anti-patterns, mistakes and big mistakes that I made and learned from. I think this will be very useful for beginner-intermediate data wranglers.\n\nSlides available here: https://github.com/alixedi/PyData2016/blob/master/Enhanced%20Financials.pdf\nGitHub: https://github.com/alixedi/PyData2016"
