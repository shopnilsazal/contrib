description: "The Struggle to Stay Technical by Kinsey Ann Durham\n\nLife is good. More and more people who never thought they could code, people of diverse backgrounds are learning to write Ruby and become full time developers. Outreach programs are doing an amazing job of getting these people into the community, but now we are facing an even bigger problem. Getting them to stay there. 57% of women alone leave the tech industry once they are there. At every turn, we are told we canâ€™t do it, offered different untechnical positions, or bullied out by toxic cultures. This talk will explore the barriers people of different backgrounds face to stay in technical positions, even once they have overcome the barriers to get there. It will present different perspectives and bring light to things we can do as an individual, an employer, a co-worker and as a community to solve this large problem that we face."
