description: "ML.NET is aimed at providing a first class experience for Machine Learning in .NET. Using ML.NET, .NET developers can develop and infuse custom AI into existing .NET apps through a code-driven and UI driven approach. ML.NET has been used extensively within Microsoft by Windows, Azure, SQL & Bing for a decade and with this first enablement we want to provide these capabilities to all .NET developers. We welcome you to become a part of this journey as we build this in the open and to demonstrate our commitment towards this effort we are launching first bits of our ML.NET experience today. This session will go into scenarios that ML.NET enables along with the vision, architecture for ML.NET.\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/azft-ml"
