description: "Secrets of Testing Rails 5 Apps by Prathamesh Sonpatki\n\nTesting Rails 5 apps has become better experience out of the box. Rails has also become smarter by introducing the test runner. Now we can't complain that about not able to run a single test or not getting coloured output. A lot of effort gone into making tests especially integration tests run faster.\n\nThe overall testing strategy is also moving from focussing testing internals to testing explicit parts of the whole system.\n\nCome and join me as we will commence the journey to uncover the secrets of testing Rails 5 apps.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/LidZ/"
