description: "ACL Steganography - Permissions to Hide Your Porn \nMICHAEL PERKLIN SECURITY RESEARCHER\n\nEveryone's heard the claim: Security through obscurity is no security at all. Challenging this claim is the entire field of steganography itself - the art of hiding things in plain sight. Most people know you can hide a text file inside a photograph, or embed a photograph inside an MP3. But how does this work under the hood? What's new in the stego field?\n\nThis talk will explore how various techniques employed by older steganographic tools work and will discuss a new technique developed by the speaker which embodies both data hiding and data enciphering properties by encoding data inside NTFS volumes. A new tool will be released during this talk that will allow attendees to both encode and decode data with this new scheme.\n\nMichael Perklin (@mperklin) is currently employed as a Senior Investigator within the Corporate Investigations department of an Enterprise class telecommunications firm. Throughout his career he has performed digital-forensic examinations on over a thousand devices and has processed petabytes of information for electronic discovery. Michael has spoken at security conferences internationally about a variety of topics including digital forensics, computer security, data hiding, and anti-forensics. Michael holds numerous security-related degrees, diplomas and certifications, is a member of the High Technology Crime Investigations Association, and is an avid information security nut who loves learning about new ways to break things.\n\nMaterials: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Perklin/DEFCON-21-Perklin-ACL-Steganography-Updated.pdf \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Perklin/Extras.zip"
