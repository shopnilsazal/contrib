description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nKubernetes Runtime Security: What Happens if a Container Goes Bad? - Jen Tong & Maya Kaczorowski, Google (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nKubernetes security typically focuses on infrastructure: verifying that configuration is safe, and your deployment has no known issues. In this talk Jen and Maya will focus on a different aspect: runtime security. Runtime security is about mitigating damage done when part of your deployment is compromised. They'll start with an overview of common runtime security concerns, and discuss how they change as you move to containers and Kubernetes. Next, they’ll highlight existing features that help you respond to these risks, and explore popular tools to detect and control compromises. They'll finish off with a demo that shows these techniques in action as they protect a web application. You'll leave with an understanding of how to plan ahead to minimize impact, and how to respond to events when they happen.\n\nAbout Maya\nMaya Kaczorowski is a Product Manager at Google, working in container security, and was previously the Product Manager for Google Cloud KMS.\n\nAbout Jen\nJen is a Security Advocate on Google Cloud Platform. In this role she helps developers and IT professionals stay out of trouble while getting the most out of cloud computing. If she’s away from her laptop, she’s probably skating around a roller derby track, or hanging from aerial silk."
