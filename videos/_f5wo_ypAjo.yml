description: "frank^2 - Trolling Reverse-Engineers with Math: Ness... It hurts...\ny = mx+b? f(x) = sin(x/freq)*amp?! SIN X = (A+BX+CX^2)/(P+QX+RX^2)?! None of these formulas as they stand alone really mean much of anything-- except maybe a headache for some. Isolating the variables, however, will eventually open the door for us to manipulate our code in creative and exciting ways. This isn't necessarily a ground-breaking technique in obfuscation, but who cares if it's fun? Given an arbitrary formula, we can place our code anywhere we like. It doesn't even need to be a traditional f(x) formula like a sinewave, either-- all we need is a number and some constants. Draw your code in circles? Sure! Sexually harass a reverse-engineer by the shape and girth of your code in memory? Hell yes! This talk will attempt to teach a functional method that allows for the random placement, concatenation and manipulation of assembly instructions for the attempt of filling up a reverser's swear jar. You don't need to write any assembly-- but you better come knowing its mechanics.\n\nfrank^2 has made a concerted effort to recursively generate arbitrary factory-factories of abstract static class pointers for the sake of synergising synthesized request-for-comment identifier palindromes as a means of deterministically reducing the Big-O notation of the algorithm which generates arbitrary bi-lateral paths to the 12 Galaxies. As the big endian of his peers he held the responsibility of keeping the order, assuring every bitty piece was kept in line. This allowed for the iterative arbitration of worldwide frankenstein living death slavery, to explore and control the entire universe. The gangster computer god also planned degeneration through markov-chain algorithms applied with a weighted percentage determined by the frequency of the word in an average set of words fed to it from the channel of communication. A second dimension could be added for greater accuracy.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
