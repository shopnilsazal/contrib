description: "Ramon Navarro Bosch - Plone 5 and how to use machine learning with it.\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nPlone is a Document Management System and Content Management System\nthat has been in the Python scope for more than 10 years.\n\nPlone 5â€™s features allow us to manage content, define various kinds of\ncontent and provide a nice useful UI to work on semantic web\ntechnologies. In this talk we are going to explain our approach for\nusing Plone with the Python machine learning toolkit sklearn (http\n://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to enable clusterization and\nclassification of content using a scalable content management system.\nWe will also add some sophisticated front-end gloss using the new\nfunctionalities on frontend development added on Plone 5 and some real\nuse cases of CMS/DMS with machine learning using sklean and solr."
