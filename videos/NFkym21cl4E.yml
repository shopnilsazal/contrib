description: "RubyConf 2016 - How I Corrupted Survey Results and (Maybe) Ruined a Business by Mike Calhoun\n\nIt was the perfect storm of events and circumstances: a first job, naïveté of inexperience, a fear of getting fired, and a loud boss prone to yelling. One morning, I realized that the first web “project” of my first job in my new career had gone horribly off track. What came to pass in the following weeks was the most involved and tense coverup I’ve undertaken in my life. This experience can tell us all about how we communicate with each other. How we can create environments where people can ask for help and how an atmosphere of pressure and tension can ruin a business."
