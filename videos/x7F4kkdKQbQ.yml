description: "RubyConf 2016 - A Look at Hooks by Craig Buchek\n\nRuby has several methods that are invoked implicitly under certain circumstances. These methods are called \"hooks\", and they provide points to extend behavior. While hooks might seem like \"spooky action at a distance\", they can be really powerful. In fact, hooks are one of the primary ways that Ruby provides for meta-programming.\n\nUnfortunately, Ruby's hooks are not all documented very well. We'll take a look at what hooks are available and how to use them. We'll also talk about when to avoid using hooks and provide some tips on how to troubleshoot when hooks are involved."
