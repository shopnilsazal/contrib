description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Mitchell Tilbrook, Moneytree.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-61\nSlides link: https://www.slideshare.net/vonGraham/kotlin-backstage-android-makers-paris-2018\n\nKotlin offers a modern language design in contrast to Java, while at the same time maintaining full Java interoperably: Data classes, properties, delegation, inline functions, string interpolation and much more. But, if Java can't offer these features how come Kotlin can? What does Kotlin do to make it possible to use this Syntactic sugar?\n\nIn this talk, we will go backstage and dig into the Bytecode that Kotlin generates to make all the features we love work on a runtime that technically does not support them. We will look at the impact kotlin code generations has on method count. Get a deeper understanding of how Object and companion object work and see the implications of the use of either under different circumstances. Finally look at common patterns that can help reduce the size of both the bytecode and method count.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
