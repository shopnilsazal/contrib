description: 'Encountering chitchat and small talk is pretty common for a bot, and it''s where a lot of bots struggle. Ron Owens joins Seth Juarez to discuss Project Personality Chat. Personality Chat helps a developer enhance their bot''s conversational capabilities, by answering a wide range of small talk queries in a consistent, identifiable tone of voice. Developers can choose from multiple default personas, selecting one that aligns well with their particular brand. Personality Chat uses intent classifiers to identify common small talk intents, and  generates responses consistent with the personality. Based on the intent and the confidence scores, it chooses the best response from a customized editorial library or generates it real-time using deep neural networks (DNNs).'
