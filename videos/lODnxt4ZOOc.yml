description: "by Ian Eyberg\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nUnikernels are often touted as being the building blocks of next generation ofcloud infrastructure. However, even the process of compiling and booting themremains daunting for the average developer let alone building outinfrastructure for them to live on. In this talk we'll dive deep into thevarious layers of infrastructure one needs to understand in order to build outtheir own infrastructure for unikernels. What might seem simple at firstquickly becomes difficult as one needs to cast aside preconceived notions ofwhat an operating system and application are and how they might interacttogether. We'll approach everything from hypervisor orchestration tofilesystems, networking and best practices for CI and testing. The attendeeshould be comfortable exploring unikernel cloud concepts by the end of thetalk.\n\nUnikernels are often touted as being the building blocks of next generation ofcloud infrastructure.
