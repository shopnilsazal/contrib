description: "Technical Art of Uncharted 4 is a reflection on the lessons learned during creation of technology that powers the current gen Art Pipeline of Naughty Dog. In this 2016 talk from Naughty Dog's Andrew Maximov, learn how they created their interactive foliage animation technology, cloth, hair and fur simulation, custom automated level of detail technology that allowed them to seamlessly render levels the size of their E3 demo, runtime softbody vehicle deformation, automated runtime object population solutions, tool analytics and more. All written almost exclusively within the Art Department.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
