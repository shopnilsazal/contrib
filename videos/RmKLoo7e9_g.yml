description: "Ted Willke leads a team that researches large-scale machine learning and data mining techniques in Intel Labs. His research interests include parallel and distributed systems, image processing, machine learning, graph analytics, and cognitive neuroscience. Ted is also a co-principal investigator in a multi-year grand challenge project on real-time brain decoding with the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. Previously, he founded an Intel venture focused on graph analytics for data science that is now an Intel-supported open source project. In 2014, he won Intel’s highest award for this effort. In 2015, he was appointed to the Science & Technology Advisory Committee of the US Department of Homeland Security. Ted holds a doctorate in electrical engineering from Columbia University, a master’s from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a bachelor’s from the University of Illinois.\n\nAbstract Summary:\n\nCan Machine Learning Save the Whales?:\nIn the 1960’s whales faced mass extinction from whaling. Careful scientific study and regulatory action saved them. Now many whale species are facing another wave of extinction due to poorly understood forces. Is it depletion of their food stock? Collisions with ships? High-energy sonar? The problem is not so obvious this time. I’ll argue that we need breakthroughs in machine learning to figure it out. I’ll discuss two new projects and the impact they had on our expeditions to Alaska in 2017. In the first, we explore the use of new features to identify individual whales. In the second, we use deep learning-based morphometry to study their energy stores, which are vital to their survival and reproduction. Both problems suffer data starvation and challenges unique to the marine environment. I’ll discuss our race to clear these hurdles and save the whales."
