description: "In September, a small team and I went to China to film The Secret Guide to Alternative Beijing - part travel guide, part documentary, largely a time capsule of what's happening in the alternative culture of China's capital. Known as \"the city of contrasts\", Beijing earns its name now more than ever. I'll talk about the polarity between the creatives we interviewed, their work, how Beijing's striking aesthetic informs its culture and vice versa.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGcn/"
