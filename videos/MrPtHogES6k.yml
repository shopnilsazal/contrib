description: 'This talk is about the twin open source project goals of, on the one hand, increasing participation and contribution to an open source project, and on the other hand including everyone while eliminating discrimination and harassment (whether deliberate or accidental). I''ll talk about different approaches to reducing discrimination, including better documentation, better development tooling, explicit onboarding process, and codes of conduct. I''ll also cover concrete steps that anyone can take to help increase inclusion and participation in the teams, communities, and open source projects that they are involved in.'
