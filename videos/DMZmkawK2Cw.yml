description: "by Stevan Little\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nPerl has been described in many ways; a Shinto Shrine, executable line noise,a Swiss Army Chainsaw, the Duct Tape of the Internet, etc. But I think Perl ismore like a old pop star, always reinventing itself to stay relevant, nevertruly leaving our consciousness, always just a melody away. What is the stateof Perl today? Will Perl 6 be the big comeback? Will 2017 be the year we makePerl great again?\n\n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:05:00"
