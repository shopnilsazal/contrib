description: 'Share what you know and roll a terminal app with the workshopper module. This talk will focus on the Git-it module, how it uses workshopper to build an app for non-coders, adds an interactive real-time server side bot with Node.js and the GitHub API, and creates GitHub Pages hosted site for much win. Git-it is used at NodeSchool events and GitHub Patchwork nights and teaches Git and GitHub fundamentals to beginners.'
