description: "“I believe the auto industry will change more in the next five to 10 years than it has in the past 50.”\n-Marry Barra, CEO of General Motors\n\nHow we move from place to place and handle our logistics is changing. Urbanization and an ever growing amount of cars on our roads is leading to traffic jams and pollution problems in our cities - not to mention their effect on global climate change. We need to fix this.\n\nThe future of mobility focuses on car technology, autonomous vehicles, and mobility services like MOIA and WhimApp. New cars also need new design and new manufacturing methods.\n\nThe future of mobility is also disrupting a market we considered to be stable and mature. Mobility is a huge business opportunity for companies of all size.\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018.
