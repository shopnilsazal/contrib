description: "ðŸ’– Support the show by becoming a Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/funfunfunction\n\nThis video explores the difference between a consumer and a maker.\n\nWe all switch between the role of consumer and maker in our day to day life, but there are people around me that seem to spend a bigger chunk of their time being makers. I aspire to be like them, because I genuinely think that they are better and more valuable people for it. \n\nDonâ€™t feel entitled to things working. \nInstead, assume responsibility, and make things better.\n\nBe a light, not a judge. Be a model, not a critic.\n\nMusic by\nhttp://www.bensound.com/"
