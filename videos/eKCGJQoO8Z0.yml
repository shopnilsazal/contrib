description: "PyData SF 2016\n\nThe blindness of modeling and how to break through. Training models from data is just like painting or capturing pictures from the world. From different angles, you will see the different pictures. The pictures are just the approximations of the world! So do the models! There must be some blindnesses behind the approximations. In this talk, we will point out several types of blindnesses in modeling procedures and introduce the solution of breaking through them."
