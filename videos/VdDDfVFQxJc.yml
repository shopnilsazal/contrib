description: "With the rise of Javascript MVC frameworks like Ember and Backbone, web programmers find themselves at a fork in the road. If they keep doing server-side web programming, they'll benefit from tried-and-true tools and techniques. If they jump into Javascript MVC, they may be able to offer a more responsive web experience, but at significant added development cost. Which should they choose?\n\nThis talk will address the strategic costs and benefits of using Javascript MVC today. I will touch on subjects such as development speed, usability, conceptual similarities with desktop and mobile applications, the decoupling of rendering and routing from server logic, and the state of the emerging Javascript MVC community. I will also discuss the impact of this seismic change on Ruby, Rails, and your career as a software engineer.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGjF/"
