description: "Description from DEF CON 9 Speakerâ€™s Page: \n\nData Mining with PHP\n\nAdam Bresson has been programming in PHP, MySQL and HTML for over five years. After his DEF CON talk on Palm Security last year, he decided to explore security on a different, free platform. With ten years of networking experience behind him, he created GNU methods for monitoring security and data mining in PHP. He hopes you extend this foundation. Ask questions!"
