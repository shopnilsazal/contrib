title: 'DEF CON 24 - Grant Bugher - Bypassing Captive Portals and Limited Networks'
language: English
recordingDate: 1479078779
description: "Common hotspot software like Chilispot and Sputnik allow anyone to set up a restricted WiFi router or Ethernet network with a captive portal, asking for money, advertising, or personal information in exchange for access to the Internet. In this talk I take a look at how these and similar restrictive networks work, how they identify and restrict users, and how with a little preparation we can reach the Internet regardless of what barriers they throw up.\n\nBio:\nGrant Bugher has been hacking and coding since the early 90â€™s and working professionally in information security for the last 12 years. He is currently a security engineer for a cloud service provider, and has previously been an architect, program manager and software engineer on a variety of online services, developer tools and platforms. Grant is a prior speaker at BlackHat and DEF CON and a regular DEF CON attendee since DEF CON 16. Most of his research and work is on cloud computing and storage platforms, application security, and detecting & investigating attacks against web-scale applications."
