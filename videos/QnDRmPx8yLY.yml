description: "The joys of PICO-8 token crunching!! Or: what I learned about programming from being restricted on every side! by Ayla Myers\n\nMaking games is hard. Making games with a limited number of sprites, sound effects, colors, bars of music, and even lines of code is… well… sorta mind-bending, actually. Because when you bump up against those restrictions you start to uncover secret trade-offs between these limited resources. Would I rather my tasty mushroom sprite have red spots, or would I prefer to be able to save high scores? How many notes in a song is a for-loop worth?\n\nCome and learn about the beautiful Bizarro World that is fantasy console game development! And maybe, just maybe, you’ll take away some insights on programming in general."
