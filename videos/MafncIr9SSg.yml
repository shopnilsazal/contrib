description: 'Ruby has demonstrated itself to be an extraordinary tool for the rapid development of prototype systems in an environment of unclear, undefined, ill-defined, missing requirements. As a dynamic language its ability to rapidly morph based upon the needs of the moment is remarkable. The way that it can be used to hide complexity via domain specific languages is unparalleled. This session reviews 5 years of success using Ruby within a research and development lab of a major USA defence contractor. Lessons learned, evolved patterns and suggestions for future improvements are on the agenda. There are movies. Bring your own popcorn.'
