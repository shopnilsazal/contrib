description: "Bring Analytics to Life with Passionate Business Uptake\n\nBig Data is an effective tool to stem attrition and many other important challenges companies face. In this session, I will share with you a case study of how LexisNexis Risk Solutions has been an industry leader by integrating predictive analytics throughout our organization from ideation through passionate uptake so that we can understand, anticipate and stymie attrition very early on in the customer lifecycle. During this session, I will explain how you can harness the power of analytics internally at your company, communicate the impact it will have on your business, operationalize it for end users, and create 100 percent buy-in and uptake by senior executives, finance, HR, customer service, sales, marketers and many other departments. In addition, I will talk with you about how we regularly use data mining and predictive analytics to make intelligent business decisions that drive real-time, bottom-line-impacting results."
