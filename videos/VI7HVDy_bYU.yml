description: "Nowadays we are observing very dynamic adoption of mobile contactless payments. These are systems provided by OS manufacturers (Android Pay, Apple Pay) as well as apps delivered by banks or 3rd party payment operators. Is it possible to clone card data? Yes, it is - demo included!\n\nWhat are other ways to attack? What are the risks and what can we do to lower it? Based on several assessments and lab experiments done by our team, I will answer these questions and provide best practices on how to mitigate the risks.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
