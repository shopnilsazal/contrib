description: "Hacking with Human Interface Devices â€“Nikhil Mittal\n \nThis talk discusses using a Human Interface Device (HID) for penetration testing. We will see how a cheap and tiny device could be effectively used against a fairly secure and locked down network. We will also see how using it can be integrated in various phases of a penetration test.\nTechniques like in-memory code execution, reverse shells, system secrets in cleartext, backdooring,  dropping weaponized files and more would be demonstrated. Only the device and built-in operating system tools will be used.\nThe talk will be full of live demonstrations."
