description: "I, Robot, Esquire: Information Extraction and Summarization in Legal Documents\n\nPundits constantly predict the demise of many types of knowledge workers at the hands of intelligent machines, and few professionals perform more textual document review than lawyers. In this session, Iâ€™ll share work that eBrevia has been doing to apply research from the fields of ML and NLP to summarize and extract information from legal contracts to help accelerate corporate mergers and acquisitions. I will look at the unique characteristics of the legal industry, examine some supervised and semi-supervised training strategies and classification models, and discuss the limitations of these techniques and the essential role lawyers will continue to play."
