description: "By Neeraj Singh\n\nActiveRecord is complex code and because of complexity it has edge cases. In fact lots of edge cases. We will take a look at a number of ActiveRecord features to see how it works and how to deal with some of the edge cases.\n\nWe will see how default_scope works. And why method \"unscoped\" removes default_scope from models but not from associations.\n\nDo you know the difference between CollectionProxy and Relation ? Do you know why in a has_many through case \"@physician.patients.create!\" would work but \"@physician.patients.where(active: true).create! would silently fail without creating the association record?\n\nWe will discuss why while patching Active Record you should run your tests against all three databases.\n\nGuess which of these two obey :destroy option: @customer.orders.delete(@order) or @customer.orders.destroy(@order).\n\nIn Rails 3 when where conditions are merged then the last where condition wins. In Rails 4 all the where conditions are 'And'ed. But not defautl_scope. We will see how and why.\n\nWill also discuss implementation detail of features like inverse_of, autosave and callbacks.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG62/"
