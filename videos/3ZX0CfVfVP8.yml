It's the best time to start testing your apps to make sure you're ready for the final release later this year. We are also eager to hear feedback on the N Developer Preview so that we can make sure we deliver the best possible product for developers to build upon.\n\nSpeaker: Wojtek Kalicinski, Google\n\n#droidconDE – cc-by-sa 3.0"
