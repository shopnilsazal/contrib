title: 'Panopticon A Libre Cross-Platform Disassembler'

description: "by Kai Michaelis\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nPanopticon is a graphical disassembler written in Rust that runs on GNU/Linux,Windows and OS X. It aims to create a free replacement for tools like IDA Proand BinDiff.\n\nAnalysis of closed source applications is necessary for security practitionersand FLOSS-developers. Roughly 1/3 of the FSF High Priority Projects willlikely involve analysis of binary applications, on top of the dedicatedreverse engineering projects. Yet, the majority of the tools to do this areclosed source themselves. This problem extends to academia where the lack ofstable and extensible binary analysis tools forces scientist to implementtheir prototypes on top of proprietary software. This further hampers adoptionof the -- publicly funded -- research by practitioners.\n\nThe Panopticon project aims to develop a tool to end the dominance ofproprietary software for reverse engineering. What sets Panopticon apart fromother free disassembler is that we believe an intuitive GUI is paramount toaid human analysts to understand as much of the binary as possible. As suchPanopticon comes with an Qt 5 UI written in QML that allows browsing andannotating control flow graphs. Panopticon implements semantic-based analysisto resolve dynamic jumps and calls. We believe that a disassembler that knowsassembly code semantics allows automation of common reverse engineering tasksand provide aids for manual analysis.\n\nThe talk will touch on the vision and architecture of Panopticon. The targetaudience are reverse engineers interested in FLOSS tools and/or advancedstatic analysis as well as developers who want to contribute to the project.\n\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 09:30:00"
