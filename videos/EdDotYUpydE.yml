description: "In this 2016 GDC talk, Zenimax Online's Richard Katz gives a lecture on  quick prototyping techniques of animation systems, which have traditionally been one of the most complex areas to author. Katz also covers more techniques for automating asset processing, fast cinematic workflows, and optimizing asset performance for run-time.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
