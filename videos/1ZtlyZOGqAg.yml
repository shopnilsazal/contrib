description: "In this 2016 GDC talk, Supercell's Jonathan Dower explains why it's sometimes necessary to kill games before they're released in order to stay competitive in the free-to-play mobile market. If you've ever wondered if it was worth soldiering through on a project, or if it needed to be dropped to avoid the sunk cost fallacy, Dower breaks down some key tips to gauge the difference between a game that can make it and a game that needs to die on the vine. \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
