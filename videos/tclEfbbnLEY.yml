description: "The WebSocket draft got implemented by browsers in February 2010, that’s 4 years ago. It must surely be ready for production now, right?\nYou implement it and spend the following months in pain: debugging dropped connections, full browser crashes, failed connections, rewriting your app to a framework only to figure out that it leaks memory and DDOSs your server so you can do a rewrite of your rewrite. But real-time doesn’t have to be this way. In this talk I will introduce the state of WebSockets and how you can use Primus fix this."
