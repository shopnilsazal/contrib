description: "Description\nIn a world where machine learning can affect human lives in unprecedented ways, how can we create interpretable and accountable models? How do we then share the reasonings with our colleagues? This talk will review why interpretability is key in public facing models as well as tools and methods for creating accurate and explainable models.\n\nAbstract\nMachine learning might be used to determine if you get a job interview, a bank loan or an acceptance letter at a university. In a world where machine learning can affect human lives in unprecedented ways, how can we create interpretable and accountable models? Once we can interpret the model used, how do we then share the reasoning with our colleagues?\n\nThis talk will review why interpretability is key in public facing models as well as tools and methods for creating accurate and explainable models. We will review the newest publications on increasing accountability in model training and see techniques for building understandable models from more difficult architectures (such as deep learning).\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
