description: "Adam Ralph\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/dotnetfringe/sdkttb/\nFounded in 2010, Nancy has grown to become one of the most popular community driven .NET web frameworks. It offers a unified, lightweight, modular API with an elegant syntax inspired by Sinatra from Ruby. The Nancy community is one of the most active in .NET open source consisting of 8 core team members and over 200 contributors! With over 2,500 stargazers, Nancy is one of the top .NET projects on GitHub. Earlier this year a tremendous milestone was reached with the long awaited release of Nancy 1.0.\nIn this talk I&#39;ll discuss the origins of the project and the journey it took during its evolution to 1.0. I&#39;ll showcase some examples which demonstrate why the framework is so compelling and share some insights on future vision for the project, including current plans for 2.0."
