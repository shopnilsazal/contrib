description: "PyData Berlin 2016\n\nThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. And that is functional - at least in my opinion. I'm working with Python for a living since two years after coming from a background in Ruby, Haskell, Clojure, and some more languages. Since then I have tried to marry ideomatic Python to the functional style I learned to love. It's time to share my experience.\n\nI will talk about\n\n- higher order functions\n- partial function application and currying\n- function composition\n- functional collection transformations (and why they are relevant for PySpark)\n- (fake) lazy evaluation\n\nand how it all relates to Python (and what's missing).\n\nSlides: https://github.com/kirel/functional-python"
