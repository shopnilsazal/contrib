description: "In this 2018 GDC talk, PlatinumGames' YOKO TARO, & game designer Takahisa Taura try to talk about the development of NieR:Automata, using their near-dead brains. It seems that they are thinking about taking a look back on the development of 'NieR:Automata', and how they came together to create one of the most perverse experiences in video game history. From the captivating imaginings of YOKO TARO to the satisfying action-packed battles of PlatinumGames Inc., they discuss their design process and how they worked to bring the world of 'NieR:Automata' to life is what they are saying they will do, but they may end up changing their minds and talking about what they have eaten in the US in detail for one full hour instead.\n\nRegister for GDC: http://ubm.io/2gk5KTU\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
