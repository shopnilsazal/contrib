description: "by Jonas van den Bogaard\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nFor FOSEM we would like to excite developers - who have interest in working onuse-cases for Smart Cities, Utility Companies and other large-scaleinfrastructure companies - for the Open Smart Grid Platform. The Open SmartGrid Platform is an Open source IoT platform for large infrastructures. Theplatform allows you to monitor and control hardware in the public space. Withseveral (generic) functions ready to use, the main benefits of the Open SmartGrid Platform are: scalability & high availability, high security, its genericdesign, and no vendor lock-in.\n\nIntroduction The Open Smart Grid Platform is an open source IoT platform. Theopen smart grid platform is a generic IoT platform, built for organizationsthat manage and/or control large-scale infrastructures. The following usecases are now readily available: smart lighting, smart metering, tariffswitching, and microgrids. Furthermore the following use-cases are indevelopment: distribution automation, load management and smart devicemanagement. The architecture of the open smart grid platform is modular andconsists multiple layers. External applications are connected to a servicedomain via the integration layer. This integration layer contains webservices. The service domain manages all the business rules such as: \"Can weallow this change?”. The core component routes the messages to the correctprotocol adaptor and contains generic functions such as device management,time synchronization and firmware management. The protocol adaptors convertthe messages to a protocol that is used by the smart objects. This messagecould be a switching command, for example.\n\nThe open smart grid platform is highly unique for embracing the open sourceapproach and the following key features: • Suitable for scalable environmentsdelivering high performance • High availability and multitenant architectures• Built with security by design and regularly tested. • It has a genericarchitecture. More use cases and domains are easily added to the platform. •The open smart grid platform is based on open standards where possible.\n\nMore information can be found on: http://opensmartgridplatform.org/ andhttp://documentation.opensmartgridplatform.org/\n\nProposal talk For FOSEM we would like to excite developers for our platform bydiscussing the reasoning behind the platform from a technical point of viewand the architecture of platform. We believe the platform is interesting fordevelopers who have interest in working on use-cases for Smart Cities, UtilityCompanies and other large-scale infrastructure companies.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 16:30:00"
