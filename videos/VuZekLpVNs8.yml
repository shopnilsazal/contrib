recordingDate: 1392703519
description: "IcE tRe, Virus, Worms and Trojans: Where are we going?\nIt seems that the major target of most online bugs is actually quite the same. Over and over again the uninspired, pop the box, seems to be what most writers are after.\n\nIn this talk I will explore a bit of virus history in relation to goals, starting with older viral intentions, moving to what appears to be the intentions today and what possibly could be the intentions tomorrow.\n\nThis talk will be fairly abstract and I will setup the examples that I use so no previous knowledge will be needed other than a basic idea of how viruses work and what damage they can cause. This information, most people already have from the coverage gleaned from your average newscast, if not other places.\n\nThis talk in particular, should appeal to the broadest audience.\n\nIcE tRe, Like many of the people attending DefCon has been involved with networking/internet/\"new media\" since the early 90's. Working with 2 major unnamed ISP over the years has helped these companies weather the storm of the past 10 years of viruses, ddos attacks and various other security problems"
