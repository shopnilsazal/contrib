description: "In this session by Katerina Skroumpelou the audience will be using physical motion applied into virtual motion, in order to move and manipulate an object (or graphics) in our browser! The “how” is exciting! They will see how to develop a simple application using WebSockets, Angular and a plain WebSocket client/server node.js server. The magic of this application will be that, once connected from our phone, we will be sending device data from our phone to the browser (using the brand new device event APIs capturing device acceleration, orientation, motion).\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
