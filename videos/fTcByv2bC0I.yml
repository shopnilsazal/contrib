However, understanding code flow and focusing on relevant parts can become much easier when employing interactive debugging techniques. This allows combining the best of penetration testing and code review benefits to achieve maximum results in the most efficient manner. In this talk we will explain and demonstrate this eye-opening technique for effectively performing a manual code review on a live system using a debugger and provide a quick starter kit for implementing this technique. \n\nOfer Maor\nDirector of Security Strategy, Synopsys\nOfer Maor is a security expert and entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience in information and application security. Ofer has been involved in application security from its early days, through research, penetration testing, consulting, and product development \n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
