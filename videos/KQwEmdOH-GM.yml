description: "Dave Thomas\nElixir: Power of Erlang, Joy of Ruby\n\nI'm a language nut. I love trying them out, and I love thinking about their design and implementation. (I know, it's sad.)\n\nI came across Ruby in 1998 because I was an avid reader of comp.lang.misc (ask your parents). I downloaded it, compiled it, and fell in love. As with any time you fall in love, it's difficult to explain why. It just worked the way I work, and it had enough depth to keep me interested.\n\nFast forward 15 years. All that time I'd been looking for something new that gave me the same feeling.\n\nThen I came across Elixir, a language by Jos√© Valim, that puts a humane, Ruby-like syntax on the Erlang VM.\n\nNow I'm dangerous. I want other people to see just how great this is. I want to evangelize. I won't try to convert you away from Ruby. But I might just persuade you to add Elixir to your toolset.\n\nSo come along and let me show you the things that I think make Elixir a serious alternative for writing highly reliable, scalable, and performant server code.\n\nAnd, more important, let me show you some fun stuff.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG9C/"
