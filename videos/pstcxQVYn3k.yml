title: 'Cascadia Ruby 2013 Advanced Multithreading in Ruby by Jerry D''Antonio'
recordingDate: 1385744578
description: "By now we've all heard apocalyptic pronouncements that because of multi-core processors all programmers are doomed to the eternal abyss of concurrent programming. I'm here to tell you that despite what the Chicken Littles say, the sky is not falling. Yes, concurrent programming is hard. Especially when you have to do it in the old-school lock-and-synchronize paradigm. But we live in the brave new world of asynchronous concurrency, event-driven programming, and actors. Between the native threads introduced in MRI 1.9 and the Java threading available to JRuby, Ruby is now a valid platform for concurrent applications. What we've been missing--until now--are the advanced concurrency tools available to other languages like Clojure, Scala, Erlang, and JavaScript. In this presentation we'll talk about the specific challenges faced when writing concurrent applications; we'll explore modern concurrency techniques such as agents, futures, and promises; and we'll use the concurrent-ruby gem to implement safe, reliable, and efficient concurrent code.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG5y/"
