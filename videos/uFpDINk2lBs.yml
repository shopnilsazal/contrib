description: "Securing Cisco Routers\n\nWe will begin with basic IOS Commands to secure a router, looking at unneeded services and turning off seldom used protocols.\_ From there we will look at configurations for defeating basic attacks against your network, including DDos,SMURF and other nasty things you can do to networks.\_ Next we will look at some Simply Access list and nifty tricks you can do with them! I will also discuss the basics of Encryption, RADIUS and other security measures you can use when making connections to multiple sites.\_\n\nRobert Muncy is currently employed by a financial company as Network Security Engineer.\_ Previous to that I worked as a hired gun for several computer consultant companies."
