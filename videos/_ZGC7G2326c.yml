description: "Description\nBy distributing a Python algorithm over 1,000 computers, a 1 week computation can drop down to 10 minutes only. Moreover, storing and processing the results can be complex and time consuming, especially with large amounts. This can be seamless and real-time. Discover the power of Spark and BigQuery.\n\nAbstract\nDuring this talk, you'll see how to:\n\n- Adapt a Python algorithm for parallel computing\n- Distribute it over 1,000 cores with Spark\n- Stream the results in real-time with BigQuery\n- Analyze the results, even while the experiment is still ongoing\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\nConduct a computational experiment in 10 minutes (instead of 1 week) & process results in real-time\nLaurent Picard"
