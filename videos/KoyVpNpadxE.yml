recordingDate: 1528101405
description: "Bluetooth mesh networking is a completely new Bluetooth technology which was released in the summer of 2017 and which makes possible many to many network topologies. Messages can be relayed between devices so that communication can extend way beyond the direct radio range of a device. So, a mesh network can cover an enormous area such as a whole office block. \n\nDevelopers will learn about the fundamental concepts relating to Bluetooth mesh networking, how things work under the hood and take the first step towards being able to exploit this new technology, which represents an amazing opportunity for new products and new revenue streams."
