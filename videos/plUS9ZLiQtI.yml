Jank-free rendering performance has been shown to positively affect user engagement and experience in many large sites, but remains an area many are unaware of how to diagnose or optimize.\nTo highlight how widespread rendering is a performance bottleneck, we're going to walk through a detailed case study of Pinterest.com. Learn about common paint issues in modern sites and equally as importantly - how to diagnose them. We'll also look at changes Interest made to get up to a 40% improvement in rendering times.\nBy the end if this session you'll be equipped with the knowledge to see a number of performance diagnosis features in Chrome DevTools to find and fix rendering issues in your own sites."
