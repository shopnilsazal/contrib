description: "Benjamin Kurtz: Functional Fuzzing with Funk\nThis talk will introduce a simple and incredibly powerful framework for the scripted generation of network traffic: Funk, a new tool for fuzzing arbitrary network protocols written using the Chicken Scheme-to-C compiler. Source code will be provided and explained, so you can start using this framework today for all your network traffic generation needs!\nSome familiarity with functional languages like Lisp or Scheme will be helpful, but not required.\n\nBen Kurtz is a software engineer at an industry-leading model-based design company. Earlier, he earned his Masters of Computer Science by applying language theory to the visual analysis of probe data under the DARPA DASADA program. Soon afterward, he discovered that it's much easier to break something than to fix it, and became the principal researcher and developer of threat generation and analysis technologies at Imperfect Networks. In other incarnations, he has worked on critical systems for power plants, passenger jets, and insurance companies. If you knew him better, this would make you nervous."
