description: "Keeping Code Style Sanity in a 10-year-old Codebase by Gabi Stefanini\n\nThis is a sponsored talk by Shopify.\n\nConversations around code consistency seem to spark either cheers or jeers from developers. In this talk, I'll explore the good, bad, and the ugly of code style consistency as illustrated by the (sometimes drama-filled) history of Shopify's 10-year-old codebase. Highlighting strategies to help you evaluate when to push for better code consistency; you will hear about our techniques, tools and guides to enrich developer experience without compromising productivity and how to ultimately make code consistency important across the organization."
