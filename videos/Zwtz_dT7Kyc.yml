description: "Ruby on Ales is a two day single track Ruby conference in Oregon. It has all of the requisite makings of a conference—presentations, opportunities to find a new job and network—but let's be honest: Ruby on Ales feels a lot like a reunion of friends and colleagues.\nNew folks and returning alumni gather each March in cozy Bend, Oregon to reconnect, to learn something new, and to drink some pretty good beer.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GNs4/"
