title: 'RailsConf 2015 - Coding: Art or Craft?'
recordingDate: 1431633026
description: "By, Emily Xie\nDevelopers often refer to their trade as both “art” and “craft,\" using the two interchangeably. Yet, the terms traditionally refer to different ends of the creative spectrum. So what is code? Art or craft?\n\nCome explore these questions in this interdisciplinary talk: What is art versus craft? How does coding fit in once we make this distinction? Is the metaphor we use to describe coding even important––and why? You’ll walk away from this discussion with a better understanding of what creating and programming means to you, and what it could mean to others."
