description: "In this GDC Europe 2016, learn how mobile developer Space Ape continues to earn revenue month after month through sophisticated live operations. CEO Simon Hade explains how Space Ape allows designers, product managers and other non-technical team members to keep the game fresh with little to no developer support.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
