description: "Abstract\nJoin us on our adventure of setting up a appsec pipeline with Docker containers. What did go wrong, how did we succeed? How do you fight false positives and how do you get the best out of the products out there without bothering the development teams too much.\n\nBio\nJeroen Willemsen is a security architect with a passion for mobile and risk management. He loves to work on secure building blocks, security automation pipelines and embedding information security risk management controls in an agile environment. He is dedicated to help developers, product owners and architects to take security seriously in their daily development life (but not too serious of course ;-)).In his spare time he loves to experiment with new technologies and frameworks.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
