description: "\"I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.\" -Mark Twain Writing small classes is hard. You know you should, but how do you actually do it? It's so much easier to write a large class. In this talk we'll build up a set of small classes starting from nothing using a set of directed refactorings applied as we build. All while keeping our classes small. We'll identify abstractions yearning to be free of their big object cages. In the process we'll also see how basic patterns such as composition, delegation and dependency injection emerge from using small objects. We'll even write some tests too.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2s/"
