description: "Keynote Address at the 25th Large Installation System Administration Conference (LISA '11), by Ben Rockwood, Joyent. \r\n\r\n**Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this video are those of the speaker(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the USENIX Association.**\r\n\r\nDevOps may be a new term, but it's not a new idea. in this session we'll deconstruct it into its three transformation phases, look back at the often referenced but rarely explained history that influences it, and see how it is a catalyst that is changing the craft of system administration."
