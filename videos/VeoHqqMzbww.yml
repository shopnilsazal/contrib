Topics that will be covered are: Test and data driven development: How to get/go from a jupyter notebook to a production scheduled batch job Automated testing of pySpark jobs Spark jobs - Python or Scala? Airflow as a Data workflow and scheduler platform Metrics and monitoring Example project pipelines * Lessons learned\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
