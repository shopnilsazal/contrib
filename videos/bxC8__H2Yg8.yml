title: 'QuBit: Introducing Quantum Superpositions'
recordingDate: 1266146860
description: "by Steven Goodwin \r\nThe only talk that can use the phrase 'quantum mechanics' and not sound pretentious! It covers the principles of programming with variables that can hold multiple values at the same time - i.e. quantum superpositions, and how (and why) it's impossible to know which of those values will be returned if you query the variable. It also details the library itself, and how to use it. (uses the C++ Qubit library, based on Damien Conway's Perl module) \r\n\r\nQuBit is a library to support Quantum Superpositions in C++. This allows each CQuBit variable to hold a number of different values at the same time. Normal mathematical operations can be performed on a QuBit, but they affect every value in the QuBit, at the same time. Binary Operations on two QuBits cause a result based on every possible outcome. \r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nâ—¦http://www.bluedust.dontexist.com/qubit/ \r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
