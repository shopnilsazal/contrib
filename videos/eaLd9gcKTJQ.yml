description: "Among ‘Internet of Things’ security research, there is one branch that no one has wanted to touch, until now: The Internet of Dongs. Internet connected sex toys in all shapes, sizes and capabilities are available on the market with many more being developed. Like many IoT devices, IoD devices suffer a great many security and privacy vulnerabilities. These issues are all the more important when you consider the private and intimate nature of these devices. To research this, the Internet of Dongs project was founded (https://internetofdon.gs).\nThis talk will explore this under researched branch of IoT and the security and privacy threats that exist. It will also cover the IoD projects efforts to bring information security best practices to the adult toy industry."
