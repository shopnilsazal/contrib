recordingDate: 1323743742
description: 'Programming languages, such as Ruby, are natural and elegant. But to achieve this elegance, things have to happen under the hood. Garbage Collection, concurrency, Global Interpreter Lock, metaprogramming, C extensions are just some of the things happening with or without our knowledge. Trying to understand these concepts, their implementations and their implications in daily coding might seem daunting. However, having a good understanding of these topics will make you a better developer. No CS degree or PhD required to attend this talk.'
