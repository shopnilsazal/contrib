OCAP is a community-driven global initiative which grew out of the first comprehensive public audit and cryptanalysis of the widely used encryption software TrueCryptÂ®. Our charter is to provide technical assistance to free and open source software projects in the public interest. We serve primarily as a coordinator for volunteers and as a funding mechanism for technical experts in security, software engineering, and cryptography. We conduct analysis and research on FOSS and other widely software, and provide highly specialized technical assistance, analysis and research on free and open source software. This talk will present how we audited TrueCrypt, detailing both the Phase I security assessment, and the Phase II cryptanalysis. Looking forward, in light of GotoFail and HeartBleed, we will discuss future plans for our next audit projects of other open source critical infrastructure.\n\nKenneth White is a co-founder of the CBX Group, and formerly principal scientist and senior security R&D engineer at Social & Scientific Systems. His work focuses on cloud security, machine learning, and distributed database architecture. At SSS, White led the Biomedical Informatics team that designed and runs the operations center for the largest clinical trial network in the world, with research centers in over 100 countries. Together with Matthew Green, White co-founded the TrueCrypt audit project, a community-driven initiative to conduct the first comprehensive cryptanalysis and public security audit of the widely used TrueCrypt encryption software. White holds a MEd from Harvard and is a PhD candidate in neuroscience and cognitive science, with research focusing on expert systems, real-time classification and machine learning. He is a technical reviewer for the Software Engineering Institute, and publishes and speaks frequently on computational neuroscience, signal processing, and security engineering.\n\nTwitter: @kennwhite\n\nMatthew D. Green, PhD is a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University. He teaches applied cryptography and builds secure systems. Green trained under Susan Hohenberger and Avi Rubin, and his research includes techniques for privacy-enhanced information storage, anonymous payment systems, and bilinear map-based cryptography. Green formerly served as a senior research staff member at AT&T Labs. Together with Kenneth White, he co-founded the TrueCrypt audit project, a community-driven initiative to conduct the first comprehensive cryptanalysis and public security audit of the widely used TrueCrypt encryption software. He blogs at Cryptography Engineering, and talks about cryptography and privacy.\n\nTwitter: @matthew_d_green \nWeb: https://opencryptoaudit.org/people"
