description: "Saqib A. Khan, M.S. - Stealth Data Dispersal: ICMP Moon-Bounce\nThis research is targeted at demonstrating that small amounts of data can be dispersed over IP based networks, utilizing the data payloads of existing protocols. Such data is expected to be kept alive on the ether until one chooses to retrieve it. The crux of the scheme is the fact that this type of data dispersal is expected to be extremely difficult to detect. Such a scheme also raises some very interesting aspects regarding using Internet traffic itself as virtual mass storage system, etc.\n\nAs an example, a specific technique created by the author, the \"ICMP Moon-Bounce\", will be presented that accomplishes our data dispersal goal.\n\nKhan is the Founder and CEO of SecurityV, Inc. a cutting edge Network Security Auditing startup. Previous to SecurityV, Khan founded and ran Secure Networks Corporation, a succesful network security integration firm w/ offices in Harvard Square, Cambridge, MA. Prior to Secure Networks, Khan performed brief consulting stints at MIT, Sun, Checkpoint, and Lucent(INS) on multiple security and programming projects.\n\nKhan's primary interests lie in Network Protocol Vulnerabilities, Artificial Intelligence, and Cosmology.\n\nNowadays, Khan resides in Miami Beach and spends equal time on partying and Network Security research. Khan has previously presented 5 techincal papers in various professional conferences. Khan has a Masters in Computer Engineering and a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from Auburn University, AL."
