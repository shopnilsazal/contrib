description: "RubyConf 2016 - It's More Fun to Compute by Julian Cheal\n\nCome with us now on a journey through time and space. As we explore the world of analog/digital synthesis. From computer generated music to physical synthesisers and everything in between.\n\nSo you want to write music with code, but don’t know the difference between an LFO, ADSR, LMFAO, etc. Or a Sine wave, Saw wave, Google wave. We’ll explore what these mean, and how Ruby can be used to make awesome sounds. Ever wondered what Fizz Buzz sounds like, or which sounds better bubble sort or quick sort? So hey Ruby, let’s make music!"
