title: 'PYCON UK 2017: Frictionless Data, Frictionless Development edit'

description: "Andrew Stretton | Friday 10:30 | Room C\n\nA common problem in Data Engineering is how to create a platform capable both of importing and exporting tabular data in numerous formats and of maintaining a change history of the data while users update and query it.\n\nTools like Trifacta (Google Cloud Dataprep [1]) provide a turnkey solution to part of the pipeline but the open source Frictionless Data [2] tools from OKFN can provide a simpler subset of these features tailored to your requirements.\n\nJust as Pandas [3] is built around the Dataframe, the Frictionless Data approach uses data packages [4] consisting of a JSON table schema and a data URI. These schemata can be easily generated for any dataset and work well for a number of applications such as:\n\n    Validating new data with tools like Goodtables [5] or tableschema-py\n\n    Building a data update interface with tools such as Handontable JS [6]\n\n    Creating declarative data processing pipelines that a front end can easily interact with via datapackages pipelines [7] and kubernetes [8]\n\n    Pushing data into various databases and repository tools such as CKAN datastore [9]\n\n    Extending the schema to allow export to linked data formats such as IIIF\n\nThe talk will cover these use cases and compare with the approaches taken by other open-source data science / BI tools such as Datashape [10] with ODO [11] from Continuum and Superset [12] from AirBnB. I will aim to demonstrate that that lightweight web standards like datapackages speed up the development process.\n\nReferences\n\n    https://cloud.google.com/dataprep/\n    http://frictionlessdata.io/tools/\n    http://pandas.pydata.org/\n    http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/\n    http://goodtables.okfnlabs.org/\n    https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable\n    https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-pipelines\n    https://kubernetes.io/\n    https://github.com/ckan/ckan/tree/master/ckanext/datastore\n        https://github.com/blaze/datashape\n        https://github.com/blaze/odo\n        https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset\n\nSlides: https://gitpitch.com/strets123/frictionless-pres#/"
