description: "Filmed at PyData London 2017\n\nDescription\nIn this talk I will explain the idea of sampling to get to your model and I will demonstrate it with examples. The goal is to start with a for loop and to end with understanding how MCMC algorithms work.\n\nAbstract\nA lot of people understand the scikit-learn models of todays world but feel uneasy about the whole MCMC method of training. Why are these algorithms different? How is it that you don't use a gradient method but a sampler instead? It can feel a bit misterious if you've not properly been introduced to this other way of thinking.\n\nIn this talk I will explain the idea of sampling to get to your model and I will demonstrate it with examples. The goal is to start with a for loop and to end with understanding how MCMC algorithms work. As a consequence the audience will also get a proper introduction to PyMC3. In particular I will discuss the following;\n\nwhy markov chain sampling can be equivalent to direct sampling\nhow to build your own MCMC sampler with a for loop\nhow this for loop can be run faster by using PyMC3 instead\nthe key idea of inference and how i was briefly able apply it in a santa kaggle competition\nhow to analyse timeseries with MCMC in PyMC3\nParts of this talk are readily available on my blog;\n\nhttp://koaning.io/switching-to-sampli...\nhttp://koaning.io/elimination-via-inf...\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
