description: "Broward Horne, Meme Mining for Fun and Profit\n\nTechnology trends are treacherous. Should you learn java or visual basic? Pay for Windows or download Linux? Will that investment in Bluetooth pay off? Or will you get suckered by a faddish book written by a fading technology guru?\n\nYou can't know the future (yet), but you can make educated guesses and tilt the odds in your favor. Meme Miner is a simple program for trend tracking. Its power lies in the business and social bandwidth concepts behind its creation.\n\nMeme Miner shows current technology trends, but also gives an historical perspective of their past. You will NOT get a lesson in HTTP hacking in this session, but you will get practical and valuable business concepts to help survive (and perhaps prosper) in the next technology upheaval.\n\nBroward Horne is a software developer with a diverse background, including several years as an electronic technician at Litton and Teradyne and as a sysadmin at a major University. Broward also has a business background, doing contract work for the United States Department of Transportation on experimental pen-based systems, early wireless LANs and two-dimension barcoding.\n\nSince 1999, he has been in java software development, mostly for sales and ordering systems in large corporations. Prior to 1991, he hacked internal networks at two major electronics companies out of curiosity, but never intentionally damaged or sabotaged any system or network.\n\nFor the past thirteen years, Broward has done business intelligence and analysis against various internet data sources, including the usenet newsgroups, Dice.com, Monster.com, Google and other search engines. This analysis kept him gainfully employed throughout the Dotcom Crash. More at http://www.realmeme.com"
