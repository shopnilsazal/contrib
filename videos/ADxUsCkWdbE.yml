description: "Unlike earlier languages, Java had a well-defined threading and memory model from the beginning. And over the years, Java gained new packages to help solve concurrency problems.\n\nDespite the memory model and standard library, Java concurrency is still subtle and often surprising.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn many of these subtleties and also see some of the changes and additions to come in Java 9 & 10."
