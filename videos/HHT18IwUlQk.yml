description: "Golden Gate Ruby Conference 2011\nChange video player: HTML5 / Flash\nSass: The Future of Stylesheets\nChris Eppstein\n\nLet's face it. CSS is dumb. There is no such thing as a DRY CSS file and stylesheets are often the biggest blemish in an otherwise beautifully coded app. Sass is the future of stylesheets. Rails 3.1 includes it by default and the W3C is adding concepts from Sass to CSS itself. This talk will cover the rationale behind Sass, the language features it provides, and best practices you can apply to start untangling your stylesheets. Chris Eppstein, the creator of Compass and Sass core team member will present."
