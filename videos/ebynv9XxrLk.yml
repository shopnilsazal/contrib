(Advanced Skill Level)\n\nContainers have had uncanny abilities to build, manage, and distribute changes as part of the containers filesystems through the use of layers and graphdrivers. A critical part of the magic making people's experience with containers delightful, this is considered a necessity in any container-based system. The complexity and integration of graphdrivers makes working with them directly cumbersome and error prone. containerd departs from this and introduces a new abstraction, known as snapshotters. Mounting a container&rsquo;s filesystem, direct manipulation, arbitrary diffing, and native copying, previously a challenge, are all now possible with minimal effort. In this talk, we'll cover the evolution of Docker  graphdrivers to containerd snapshotters, demonstrating the wonderful properties of snapshotters in the process.\n\nAbout Stephen\nStephen Day is a software engineer at Docker. His many contributions to Docker ecosystem projects include SwarmKit and the version 2 specification for the Docker Registry HTTP API, and evolving the available models for container image distribution. He currently works on containerd and as a maintainer of the OCI Image Specification."
