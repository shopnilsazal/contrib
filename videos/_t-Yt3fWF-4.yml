title: 'Ruby On Ales 2013 Maintaining a large OSS project: war stories by Ryan Bigg'
recordingDate: 1369074719
description: "At the end of 2011, I switched from being a Ruby consultant to being one of the lead maintainers of the biggest OSS Ruby projects. Best part is: I get paid to do it.\n\nDuring that time, I've learned an awful lot about what it means to be responsible for something as massive as this project. Refactoring the code without causing tears for loyal users has been an extremely interesting problem to have.\n\nI have some rather interesting stories to tell, like the time I renamed most of the files deliberately on purpose, or that time I ripped out a component that people depended on, and everyone was still happy. There's even been times where code has been moved out of the models and into new classes, which seems to be the cool thing to do.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGbA/"
