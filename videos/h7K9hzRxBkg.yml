description: "Droidcon Paris 2015\nWhen I started making a Cardboard App, I had a lot to learn. I didn't know much about OpenGL, things kept breaking when I changed little details... it was painful.\n\nNot being a very sensible person, I kept going, and I'd like to share with you some of the things I found out:\n\n- OpenGL: How to use as little of it as possible.\n- Fill the scene: How to programatically create and design fun and simple 3D models.\n- Shaders: Math is fun, or, How to impress your friends with parallel processing.\n- Avoiding Death by Build: Use scripting and live shader editing to get instant feedback.\n- Look Ma, no Hands: Solving the VR input problem with Android Wear. \n\nSlides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7fEiQkvHybLSE9yY29pQkl1a2c/view\n\nDroidcon Paris 2015, more information here: http://droidcon.fr/schedule/"
