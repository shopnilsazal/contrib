description: "Break It Down by: Ben Scofield\n\nRails has been around for seven years now, which means there's been more than enough time for us to build huge, monolithic apps that do way too much. It's no surprise, then, that we've started to see a surge of interest in the decomposing large apps into a set of smaller, interrelated services.\nIn this talk, I'll show just how to go about decomposing one app into these sorts of services -- from identifying splittable functionality, to extracting it, and to integrating the service back into the main app.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GtjD/"
