recordingDate: 1392703663
description: "h1kari,Smart Card Security: From GSM to Parking Meters\nSmart Cards are used all over the place in every day life. The unfortunate (or fortunate) side of Smart Cards is that most widely deployed systems don\"t use any real security and rely mostly on obscurity. This presentation will discuss the different types of Smart Cards, exactly how to reverse engineer the protocols they use, and how to exploit their security weaknesses. For demonstration, we will look at GSM SIM Cards and San Diego Parking Meter Debit Cards and show how their security can be defeated.\n\nh1kari has been in the security field for the past 5 years and currently specializes in 802.11b Wireless Security, Smart Card, and GSM development specifically to exploit its various inherent design weeknesses. He is the main developer of the bsd-airtools project, a complete 802.11b penetration testing and auditing toolset, that implements all of the current methods of detecting access points as well as breaking wep on them and doing basic protocol analysis and injection. David has spoken at numerous international conferences on Wireless Security, has published multiple whitepapers, and is regularly interviewed by the media on computer security subjects.\n\nh1kari is also the founder of Nightfall Security Solutions, LLC and one of the founding members of Dachb0den Research Labs, a non-profit southern california based security research think-tank. He's also currently the chairman of ToorCon Information Security Conference and has helped start many of the security and unix oriented meetings in San Diego, CA."
