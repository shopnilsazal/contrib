description: "The Ruby on Rails developer faces an interesting duality. Their inner Rubyist is driven by a sense of beauty and explores a wide range of ways to solve a problem. The inner Railser is driven by a strong set of conventions and is guided by the Rails Wayâ„¢. The /lib directory is where these developers meet and end result is a junk drawer of awkward code.\nIn this talk, I go over a few ways to keep this junk drawer problem from happening by adding some conventions I've created from building Rails in anger: \n* Treat /lib as a temple (keep /lib in a state to extract to a gem in minutes) \n* Avoid autoloading everything in /lib \n* Use configuration to hide credentials from your library code \n* Isolate your Domain Objects from library concerns through DCI\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGaw/"
