In addition to well-known usages like keyboard, mouse, and mass storage, a much wider range of capabilities exist such as Device Firmware Update, USB On-The-Go, debug over USB, and more. What actually happens on the wire? Is there interesting data we can observe or inject into these operations that we can take advantage of? In this talk, we will present an overview of USB and its corresponding attack surface. We will demonstrate different tools and methods that can be used to monitor and abuse USB for malicious purposes.\n\nJesse Michael has been working in security for over a decade and is currently a security researcher at a Fortune 50 company who spends his time causing trouble and finding low-level hardware security vulnerabilities in modern computing platforms.\n\nMickey Shkatov is a security researcher at a fortune 50 company covering a variety of topics in software, firmware and hardware. He also spend most of his time trying to find new ways to annoy Jesse."
