description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2016 in Washington, DC\nhttps://2016.appsecusa.org/\n\nThe talk will generalize the recent spate of deserialization attacks, including a brief discussion of an originally authored exploit for a recently discovered CVE. \n\nThe commonalities between deserialization attacks will then be discussed, laying the framework for a \"how to\" guide on finding and exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities.\n\nThe talk will also explain the incredible difficulty faced when using traditional appsec defenses (input validation, signaturing) to stop these vulnerabilities, and explain free and open source options for builders to protect themselves from such attacks.\n\nArshan Dabirsiaghi\nChief Scientist, Contrast Security\nArshan is an accomplished security researcher with over 10 years of experience advising large organizations on application security. Prior to Contrast Security, Arshan spent 8 years at Aspect Security in a research role where he used static and dynamic technology to perform security assurance work, including code reviews, architecture reviews and penetration testing. \n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
