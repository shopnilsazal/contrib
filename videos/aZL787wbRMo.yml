description: "(Transcription coming soon, sorry for the delay ) \nEDS: Exploitation Detection System \nAMR THABET MALWARE RESEARCHER, Q-CERT\n\nIn the last several years, exploits have become the strongest weapons in cyber warfare. Exploit developers and vulnerability researchers have now become the nuclear scientists of the digital world. OS Companies and third party companies have created several security mitigation tools to make it harder to use these vulnerabilities and have made exploit creation harder.\n\nIn this presentation, I will talk about a new security mitigation tool which is based on the co-operation of several mitigations to cover their weaknesses. It's based on monitoring the memory changes without decreasing the performance of the running application and creates a multi-layer protection with regular mitigations.\n\nAmr Thabet (@Amr_Thabet) a Malware Researcher at Q-CERT with 5+ years experience in reversing malware and researching. I'm the Author of many open-source tools like Pokas Emulator and Security Research and Development Framework (SRDF). \nFacebook: http://fb.com/AmrHassanThabet\n\nMaterials: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Thabet/DEFCON-21-Thabet-EDS-Exploitation-Detection-System-Updated.pdf \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Thabet/DEFCON-21-Thabet-EDS-Exploitation-Detection-System-WP-Updated.pdf"
