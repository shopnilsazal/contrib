language: English
recordingDate: 1451048125
description: "In a world full of targeted attacks and complex exploits this talk explores an attack that can simplified so even the most non-technical person can understand, yet the potential impact is massive:\n\nEver wonder what would happen if one of the millions of bits in memory flipped value from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa? This talk will explore abusing that specific memory error, called a bit flip, via DNS.\n\nThe talk will cover the various hurdles involved in exploiting these errors, as well as the costs of such exploitation. It will take you through my path to 1.3 million mis-directed queries a day, purchasing hundreds of domain names, wildcard SSL certificates, getting banned from payment processors, getting banned from the entire Comcast network and much more.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nLuke Young (@innoying) - is a freshman undergraduate student pursuing a career in information security. As an independent researcher, he has investigated a variety of well-known products and network protocols for design and implementation flaws.
