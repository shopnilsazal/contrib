description: "Mauri - VPython goes to School\n[EuroPython 2014]\n[22 July 2014]\n\nUsing VPython in high school is an interesting way to introduce students to get in touch with computer programming concepts and to link computer science with other disciplines like Math, Geometry, Physics, Chemistry\n\n-----\n\nMy presentation is focused mainly on my teaching experience in a high school using VPython. I've posed some problems to my students to solve with VPython: from basic static building representations like castle to more complex dynamic models like bouncing balls.\nThis approach seems a good way to get in touch with computer programming concepts and to link computer science with other disciplines like Math, Geometry, Physics, Chemistry"
