description: "For many designers, the choices a player has available to them in a game are meant to give them options on how they want to overcome obstacles. The player negotiates between choices in order to defeat a greater challenge. But what if you took away the challenge? What if there was nothing to defeat? What would negotiation between choices look like then?
