title: 'Rails Conf 2013 Crafting Gems by Pat Allen'
recordingDate: 1370272580
description: "You understand Ruby and Rails, and you've gotten the hang of using other peoples' gems - but what about writing your own? Gems underpin almost every piece of Ruby code we write - and so, being able to craft your own gems is not only incredibly useful, it provides an avenue for code reuse and open source sharing. During this session, Pat will first discuss the ecosystem around gems and the knowledge required to write your own, plus a few tools available to assist with this, and some approaches for how to structure gems that integrate with Rails itself. The workshop will then put this knowledge into practice by building our own gems from scratch.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG9Y/"
