description: "KubeCon: A Story of Two Service Discoveries: Bringing Legacy to Kubernetes - Mark Petrovic, PayPal/Xoom & Brandon Philips, CoreOS, Inc \n\n\"Many companies have a service discovery solution whether it is home grown, purchased, or something in-between. Kubernetes will have to inter-operate with those systems as it begins to move into existing environments.\n\nThis talk outlines the DNS and proxy based service discovery system that Xoom (a PayPal company) uses in all of their production infrastructure. And how a combination of containerization of the existing system, Kubernetes configuration changes, and architectural creativity gave the new Kubernetes-based platform the ability to bridge into existing systems.\"\n\nAbout Mark Petrovic\nMark Petrovic is software engineer and architect at Xoom, A Paypal Service. Prior to joining Xoom, Mark was VP R&D for EarthLink, and Visiting Scientist at IBM Research Division. He now enjoys as much Go and Kubernetes as time allows.\n\nAbout Brandon Philips\nBrandon Philips is helping to build modern Linux server infrastructure at CoreOS as CTO. Prior to CoreOS, he worked at Rackspace hacking on cloud monitoring and was a Linux kernel developer at SUSE. As a graduate of Oregon State's Open Source Lab he is passionate about open source technologies."
