description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nKubernetes as an Abstraction Layer for a Connected Home - Scott Nichols, Google (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nThe home-of-the-future is vendor lock-in and disparate ecosystems that do not interconnect. Consumers are encouraged to stay within brand or risk lack of interoperability. The same can be said about Cloud Vendors. The Open Service Broker API (OSBAPI) is a standard that we can use to avoid Cloud Vendor lock-in. Can Kubernetes and OSBAPI also give us the open connected home consumers dream of? With Kubernetes used as a command and control platform for a connected home with a diverse collection of devices, complex interactions between currently incompatible devices becomes possible. With OSBAPI as the method of interoperability, it can also solve the challenge of a cloud based Kubernetes cluster controlling a on-premise Service Broker without a consistent internet connection or blocked in-bound network communication. This is going to be illuminating.\n\n\"About Scott\nScott Nichols is a Software Engineer at Google. His current focus contributing to the Open Service Broker API and Kubernetes' Service Catalog project. Scott has a passion for magic-like computer interactions.\""
