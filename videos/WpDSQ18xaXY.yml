description: "Forensic Investigations of Web Exploitations - Ondrej Krehel\n\nInvestigation of hacking incidents often requires combine effort of different technologies. Evidence and forensics artifacts are often found in various forms and formats. Network Forensics is one of the components in the process of finding compromised hosts, capturing and reconstructing malicious sessions. Attacks on web vulnerabilities can be replayed and transmitted data uncovered. This session will cover open source tools used for investigation of web compromised hosts and network forensics. Variety of tools can produce quite significant supplement to electronic evidence, and in many cases also capture the malicious executables transmitted in the traffic, or ex-filtrated data. Various network protocols and their structure will be presented. Open source Network forensic tools will be used on the traffic captured from a hacked web server. Different tools will be introduced for specific tasks in the investigation process. Captured traffic will be analyzed and reconstructed, and various artifacts found in the investigation will be discussed.\nSpeakers\n\nOndrej Krehel\nSpoke at RSA, CEIC, Prague Cyber Summit, ICS South Africa\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
