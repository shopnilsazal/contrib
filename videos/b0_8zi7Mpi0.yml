description: "Understanding Common Vulnerabilities by Eileen Uchitelle \n\nThe Internet is built on technology that was never meant to work together. Basic features in seemingly simple and innocuous technologies, such as XML, resulted in these technologies being insecure. In this session weâ€™ll talk about how attackers exploit well known vulnerabilities like XSS, XXE, and CSRF and how to make more secure software by avoiding similar decisions that resulted in these exploits.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/IM3o/"
