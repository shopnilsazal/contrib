description: "DevOpsDays NYC 2016 - Moving Fast Together: Test-Driven Infrastructure by Victoria Jeffery\n\nThe DevOps world is all about speed. We ship fast, and weâ€™re proud of that. But with our infrastructure changing every day, and the complexity, requirements, and size of projects getting greater, it has become challenging and time-consuming to meet the quality expectations. In order to work together and collaborate effectively in a high velocity environment, uncertainty and complexity needs to be reduced. This talk will cover a devops workflow that helps establish trust in your software development and release process."
