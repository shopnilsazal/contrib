description: "Simulated Gravity Comes from Within!! by Paul Frazee\n\nThe massively-multiplayer game Eve Online slows down the in-game clock when there are too many players in a region. That way, the network has enough time to process all those players.\n\nSo here’s a question: What if you slowed down the clock – not in regions, but variably throughout the entire game, as one big region? Wouldn’t that screw with your physics engine? I got curious, so I wrote a simulation with this time dilation added and… well, objects started orbiting each other!! The weird thing? I didn’t include gravity in my program.\n\nPaul’s a lifelong hacker with a love for games, music, history, and design. Paul cofounded Blue Link Labs and the Beaker Browser project."
