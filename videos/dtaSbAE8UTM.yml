description: "One of the most important duties of an Android developer is to increment the usability of the application. While doing this, it's easy to forget that a part of the Users has some degree of impairment that can be an obstacle in the normal application flow.\n\nUnderstanding this is essential for anyone who is preparing to publish an app on the store, because sometimes also a simple to understand application can, for example, become unusable for someone with impaired sight or impaired motion functionality.\n\nAndroid Platform offers several opportunities to overcome those difficulties, in this talk, we will have an overview of the impact of those users on the play store, and we will recap the basic design best practices to follow in order to make our application more accessible to a larger pool of users, using labeled content, auto scalable texts, larger target and so on.\nFinally a small practical tour of examples to better understand what a usable application should offer and what to avoid in order to avoid to deliver an application that is not usable by everyone."
