description: "Niall Richard Murphy, Google\n\nThe talk will feature research from international standardisation committees, the history of women, work, and computerization, and personal anecdotes of the mainframe era to construct a theory as to how and why engineering and operations split apart. We will also examine the issues with an eye to gender and workplace politics.\n\nIn the course of this talk, we will look at:\n\nThe earliest jobs in computers (~40s). What were they, why did they exist, and who held them?\nWhat different and distinct things happened in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and noughties?\nWhat was the difference between the keypunch operator and the computer operator?\nWhat was unglamorous about programming in the 40s, such that women were allowed to do it?\nWhat factors led to women being crowded out of programming as a profession?\nWhy did system administration come into being as a job family, and why was it minimally viable to separate that from programming?\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
