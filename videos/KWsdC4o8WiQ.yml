description: "Two self-managed Docker clusters deployed on public clouds and fight each other in a ruthless battle. One has been designed to resist any form of threat. The other one's only aim is to destroy the first one. Who's going to win?\n\nThrough this fantasy, we'll first cover all the technologies concretely used to set up the platforms and run the battle (linuxkit, infrakit, & swarm mode, and even raspberry devices among others), while we'll step back in the second part to address the subsequent architecture stakes involved : reliability, scalability, edge computing, immutability, micro-services, hybridation, distributed storage will hold no secret for you ! Most of all, you'll understand the importance of the synergies implied between the platform's and the app's design to achieve such a result."
