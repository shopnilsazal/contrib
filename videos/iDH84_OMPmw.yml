description: "The past several years has seen the introduction of new functionality and practices into core Android development, with such elements as the Support Library, Architecture Components, and Kotlin. But all of the old programming approaches still work. So what's an Android developer supposed to do?\n\nThis talk will not only cover these new aspects of Android development; we will talk about why they exist and how to understand modern development of Android applications. Developers will leave with a better idea of what they should know and use in their projects."
