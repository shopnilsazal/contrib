description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #12\n25 February 2018\nSponsored and Hosted by Taboola\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\n\nInterpreting genomic information is a key component in realizing the precision medicine revolution. In the last decade, the field has made major progresses in pinpointing DNA features that are associated with certain diseases and conditions, such as heart illnesses, cancer, and psychiatric disorders. However, these models explain relatively very small fraction of the overall variance of the trait in the population, significantly limiting their clinical-utility. One potential issue is that current genomic frameworks use a simple linear model.\nAt MyHeritage, we took a radically different approach of using the predictive power of deep-learning to create genomic predictions, which we dub \"Deep Genomic Predictions\". From an algorithmic perspective, deep genomic predictions has the advantage of robustness to overfitting and taking into account non-linear interactions between the genomic features.\nWe tested our framework on predicting adultsâ€™ height, a trait with a strong genetic component. In this talk we will give of an overview the problem and scale challenges at hand at the genomics scale, describe our solution, give highlights of our architecture, and compare our results with previous approaches. Further, this technique allows for a natural visualization of influences of different areas of the genome on the target variable.\nThis is join work with Professor Yaniv Erlich.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
