recordingDate: 1513372517
description: "Using Kubernetes to Change Legacy Systems and Processes in the Public Sector [B] - Audun Fauchald Strand, Norwegian Welfare Administration\n\nKubernetes is the implementation of the modern software development process. Continuous Release and “you built it, you run it”. For the last few years I have been working on introducing kubernetes into an organization with continuous release, microservices and “you build it, you run it”, as presented at Kubecon in Berlin 2017.\n\nNow I work for the public sector in Norway, where the systems are old, and the processes are older. I will present the experiences from working on changing these legacy organisations, using containers and kubernetes as the main tool. I will cover:\n\n- migrating old legacy apps to kubernetes, is it possible\n- manual testing done easy with containers\n- monitoring for everyone\n- making a PAAS that everyone can use\n- stable and robust deployment, but not just 4 times a year\n- how to leverage all the hardware that is owned by the public sector\n\nAbout Audun Fauchald Strand\nTeam Lead - Platform and automation, NAV - Norwegian Welfare Administration: k8s, ddd, jvm, Kafka, distributed systems, testing, Tottenham. Almost called \"Large viking shaped Norwegian\" in LWN"
