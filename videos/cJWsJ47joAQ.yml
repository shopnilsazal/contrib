title: 'DEF CON 24 - Guevara Noubir,  Amirali Sanatinia - Exposing Snooping Tor HSDir Relays'
language: English
recordingDate: 1479078791
description: "Tor is a widely used anonymity network that protects users' privacy and and identity from corporations, agencies and governments. However, Tor remains a practical system with a variety of limitations, some of which were indeed exploited in the recent past. In particular, Tor's security relies on the fact that a substantial number of its nodes do not misbehave. \n\nPrevious work showed the existence of malicious participating Tor relays. For example, there are some Exit nodes that actively interfere with users' traffic and carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. In this work we expose another category of misbehaving Tor relays (HSDirs), that are integral to the functioning of the hidden services and the dark web. The HSDirs act as the DNS directory for the dark web. Because of their nature, detecting their malicious intent and behavior is much harder. We introduce, the concept of honey onions (honions), a framework to detect misbehaving Tor relays with HSDir capability. By setting up and deploying a large scale honion over Tor for more than 72 days, we are able to obtain lower bounds on misbehavior among HSDirs. \n\nWe propose algorithms to both estimate the number of snooping HSDirs and identify them, using optimization and feasibility techniques. Our experimental results indicate that during the period of our work at least 110 such nodes were snooping information about hidden services they host. We reveal that more than half of them were hosted on cloud infrastructure and delayed the use of the learned information to prevent easy traceback. Furthermore, we provide the geolocation map of the identified snooping Tor HSDirs\n\nBio:\nGuevera Noubir holds a PhD in Computer Science from EPFL and is currently a Professor at Northeastern University. His research focuses on privacy, and security. He is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER Award (2005). He led the winning team of the 2013 DARPA Spectrum Cooperative Challenge. Dr. Noubir held visiting research positions at Eurecom, MIT, and UNL. He served as program co-chair of several conferences in his areas of expertise such as the ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks, and IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security. He serves on the editorial board of the ACM Transaction on Information and Systems Security, and IEEE Transaction on Mobile Computing.\n\nAmirali Sanatinia is a Computer Science PhD candidate at Northeastern advised by Professor Guevara Noubir, and holds a Bachelors degree in CS from St Andrews University. His research focuses on cyber security and privacy, and was covered by venues such as MIT Technology Review and ACM Tech News. He is also the OWASP Boston NEU Student chapter founder and leader."
