description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://gsec.hitb.org/materials/sg2015/\n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\nThis talk is about applying analogue thinking to Network Security.\n\nIt’s about a different way of approaching our defenses, understanding the attackers and hopefully will inspire others. It’s about a mélange of concepts, many analogue, that when combined in various ways, I hope will help our industry.\n\nMy goal is to introduce some ideas more conventionally thought of as ‘analogue’ than digital, then glue them together in various ways to offer different views on how to solve security problems – whether they be in the cyber, physical or human domains.\n\nNote: In his usual animated and dynamic style, Schwartau assembles some fascinating concepts and approaches to security that have evolved over the last 20  years. You will not be bored!\n\nABOUT WINN SCHWARTAU\n\nAs an acknowledged global expert in the field of information security, Mr. Schwartau has testified before Congress, advised committees and has consulted as an expert witness. He has appeared regularly on popular US, European and Asian television shows, (CNN, BBC, ITV, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNBC), as well as multiple radio shows nationwide. He has been featured in dozens of documentaries aired on The Learning Channel, Discovery Channel, A&E, History, BBC, CBC and more.\n\nHis first non-fiction book, “Information Warfare: Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway (1993, 1994, 1996, 1997) developed the concepts and taxonomies of Information Warfare and Cyberterrorism. The principles he developed in “Time Based Security,” (1999, 2001) have redefined how security is measured, and employs means to quantify network protection, detection and reaction processes. These new principles of security are being rapidly expanded to encompass all three elements of the new security triad: people, physical and cyber.\n\nWith thousands of credits to his name, Schwartau writes on security, information warfare, privacy, culture and how they all fit together. He consults with private and government organizations around the world, constantly pushing the envelope of understanding and thought. Major White Papers include Verisign: Defining PKI and eFortress: Visualization."
