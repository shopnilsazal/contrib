description: "Building a Secure DevOps Pipeline\n\nIs software development outpacing your ability to secure your company’s portfolio of apps?  You don’t have to buy into Agile, DevOps or CI/CD to realize the business wants to move faster.  And it's not like you didn’t already have more than enough to do. This talk will cover how to take the lessons learned from forward thinking software development and show you how they have been applied across several business.  This isn’t a theoretical talk.  It covers the results of  successfully applying these strategies to AppSec across multiple companies ranging from 4,000 to 40,000+ employees.  Yes, real stats on improvements seen will be provided. By changing focus from a point in time security testing and assessments to automation, continual health checks and event-based security, your AppSec program can start to keep pace with the increasing speed of delivery your business is trying to obtain.  By embracing the same methodologies, you can turn Docker from a problem to how you horizontally scale your security work.  Don't swim against the current of DevOps, Agile software development and Continuous Delivery.  Instead use those movements to speed your AppSec program to new levels.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\nMatt Tesauro\nSenior Technical Project Engineer, OWASP Foundation\nMatt Tesauro is currently working full-time for the OWASP Foundation, adding automation and awesome to OWASP projects.
