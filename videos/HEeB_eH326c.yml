description: "By, Leif Wickland\n\nScala has many, well-known WTF LOLs that result from the language too enthusiastically attempting to help the programmer. Scala can also be written across a wide range of styles from the Typelevel to the Better Java.\n\nThe Scala ecosystem has static analysis and linting tools which can help avoid confusing behavior, baffling compiler messages, and divergent coding styles. We'll survey the available tools, considering which can be best applied in greenfield and existing projects.\n\nAttendees will leave with steps to immediately improve their production builds and strategies to introduce more sweeping changes with time.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FoG7/"
