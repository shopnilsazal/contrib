description: "Teamwork ain't always easy. From meetings where everybody has something to say but nothing gets done to poor decisions being made because the most senior or most forceful team member won the argument; sometimes you long for the days of high-walled cubicles and lone ranger coding. Long no more.\n\nIn this workshop, you will learn a few simple techniques that drastically improve a team's ability to work together toward common goals with less conflict and more genuine collaboration.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGZo/"
