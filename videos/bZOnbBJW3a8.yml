The gotchas that slow us down or trip us up are often outside of the code we write, manifesting instead in our process or how we work with our peers. Whether you're new to programming or a veteran of many projects, these 5 things can improve your code, your career, and your team, and is a refresher course on what goes into the day-to-day, reminding us to have some empathy for individuals new to our community.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Ft3U/"
