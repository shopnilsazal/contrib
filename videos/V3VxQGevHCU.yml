description: "PyData Carolinas 2016\n\nTogether, we will use Jupyter notebooks and the new Jupyter dashboard and declarative widget extensions to create an interactive application. By doing so, we hope to demonstrate the value of the Jupyter ecosystem for rapidly building just-good-enough solutions.\n\nWe will start by finding and analyzing relevant data in a Jupyter notebook. We will drag-and-drop our notebook cells into a grid layout, and publish it as a standalone web app. We will add interactivity to our notebook and redeploy our app as we iterate."
