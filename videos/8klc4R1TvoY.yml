title: 'RubyConf 2014 - Ruby-red onions: Peeling Back Ruby''s Layers in C Extensions by Emily Stolfo'
recordingDate: 1419261849
description: "The fact that Ruby has different implementations is both strange and powerful. Writing an extension for the language can be a daunting task but there's no better way to get to the heart of what exactly Ruby objects are and the reason for some of the language's quirks.\n\nIn this talk, we'll use an example of writing a C extension for Ruby to use a third-party C security library. We'll peel back the layers of Ruby objects to deepen our knowledge of MRI and to understand in a little more detail what it really means to write object-oriented code.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Fqst/"
