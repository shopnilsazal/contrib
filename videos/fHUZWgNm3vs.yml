description: "View slides for this presentation here:\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/PyData/py-cassa\n\nPyData NYC 2014\nPyCassa is a python wrapper for Cassandra, the open source non-relational database. Cassandra has gained a lot of momentum recently because of big data problems and its ability to scale well. Rather than adding more memory to a machine and having to change the database schema, you just add more servers which forms a cluster of \"nodes.\" In this talk I'll go over setting up Cassandra in windows and connecting to it with PyCassa."
