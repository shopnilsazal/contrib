description: "When the Going Gets Tough, Get TUF Going! [I] - David Lawrence & Ashwini Oruganti, Docker\n\nSoftware distribution and packaging systems are rapidly becoming the weak link in the software lifecycle. In this talk we will look at the security landscape of existing software update systems and signing strategies. We will then introduce The Update Framework (TUF), a new signing framework that looks to address many of the challenges found in existing systems and more.\n\nTUF provides protections against data tampering, rollbacks, key compromise, and other more esoteric attacks. We will investigate how it achieves these protections and show you how to start using it today.\n\nWhile TUF is a general signing framework, we will also address use cases specific to the Cloud Native Ecosystem. These include how to use TUF signing to de-privilege cluster managers and attach metadata to images and containers in a decentralized manner which can be leveraged for policy management.\n\nAbout David Lawrence\nLay security developer that has learned a lot of mistakes the hard way. David started off building authentication systems, moved on to encrypted cloud storage for a few years, and is now working on the Security Team at Docker, presently focused on securing software distribution\n\nAbout Ashwini Oruganti\nAshwini is a Security Engineer at Docker and an open source developer. She is the author of pyca/tls, a pure-python TLS 1.2 implementation with opinionated and secure APIs. In the past, she has worked on Twisted - an asynchronous event-driven networking framework, and Hippy - a PHP implementation in RPython."
