description: "Several libraries that enable action game programming in Haskell have emerged, allowing us to play with game ideas in the strictest of functional programming environments. Come along for a brief introduction to game programming using Netwire, a library for functional reactive programming in Haskell. You will learn, perhaps surprisingly, how well functional programming fits with game programming models. In deconstructing the Wire type, we'll learn useful methods for thinking about complicated parametric data types.\n\nOur case studies are Flying Sheep Battles, a 2-player physics-based game written in Haskell over a weekend, and the presentation itself, which is also a Netwire application.\n\nFor more on YOW!
