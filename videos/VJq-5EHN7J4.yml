description: "By Jessica Eldredge\n\nAs developers, most of our time is spent on computers; but sometimes pen and paper is the best way to explore and develop our ideas. Sketchnoting uses hand-drawn elements to enhance focus, improve memory, and visualize important concepts. This talk will cover techniques to visually capture ideas, how to approach the mental multitasking required to sketch during technical talks and meetings, and explain why \"I can't draw\" is just a mental barrier to embracing creativity in your notes.\n\nI am a web designer and front end developer at Shopify. I love UX and web development, Sass, and riding my refactor tractor through views and CSS. I love talking about comic books, wine, cats, and how cold it is in Canada. You can often find me with my nose buried in a sketchbook at conferences.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1I/"
