title: 'DEF CON 17 - Sherri Davidoff - Death of Anonymous Travel'
recordingDate: 1384933105
description: "Death of Anonymous Travel\nSherri Davidoff Philosecurity\n\nWorldwide, people who use cars, buses, trains, and carry cell phones are tracked in increasingly centralized corporate and government databases. This capability is still in its infancy, and has been facilitated by payment systems which are linked to identification and refer to centralized electronic databases.\n\nMass tracking and surveillance capabilities have arisen organically, often as side effects of new technologies, and are being increasingly leveraged by government and law enforcement in the name of national security. For security purposes, the public is generally not provided with detailed information about the management and use of mass surveillance systems.\n\nAs a result, relatively small groups are able to track and control the movements of average citizens around the world, every minute of every day. These systems are opaque, not well documented, publicized or regulated.\n\nThe purpose of this presentation is to:\n\n* Collate and disseminate information about current known travel monitoring practices;\n* Discuss technical and social solutions for maintaining personal privacy and the freedom to assemble;\n* Encourage greater transparency and public control over data collection and use.\n\nThe presentation will include a Touch-and-Feel Fare Collection table, where attendees can browse the speaker's historical collection of automobile, coach, subway, telephone, and airline fares/tokens/passes. Attendees are welcome to non-destructively analyze electronic devices with magstripe/RFID readers and other tools.\n\nSherri Davidoff is a professional security consultant, researcher and writer. She conducts penetration tests, network assessments and forensics for a wide variety of industries, including financial, health care, manufacturing, academic, and government institutions. She has conducted extensive research on privacy and the effects of technology on anonymous travel and communications, and she is the co-author of SANS 558: Network Forensics. Sherri publishes weekly articles on Philosecurity.org\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
