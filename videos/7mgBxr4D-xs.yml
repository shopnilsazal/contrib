Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nApplying Least Privileges through Kubernetes Admission Controllers - Benjy Portnoy, Aqua Security (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nAn admission controller intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server prior to persistence of the object. By applying proper admission controls in your Kubernetes cluster, it's possible to generate deployments that adhere to the least privilege model, limiting user and container activity based on their business usage needs. \n\nIn this session, we will review the latest and greatest Kubernetes 1.9 admission controller capabilities, we will demonstrate in a live demo a dynamic admission control webhook that can be customized to limit privileged user access.\n\nAbout Benjy Portnoy\nBenjy is a seasoned cyber security professional with over 15 years experience in consulting, designing, and implementing strategic information security projects for organizations across EMEA.
