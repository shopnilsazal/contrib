description: 'In this talk, University of Washington''s Kanit "Ham" Wongsuphasawat discusses the design of visualization tools that augment chart authoring with automated design and recommendation, such as Vega-Lite. The Vega-Lite visualization grammar provides a concise language for composing a broad range of interactive charts by automatically generating sensible defaults for low-level chart details. With a JSON syntax, Vega-Lite can be used as a language and file format for authoring charts in data science environment like JupyterLab.'
