description: "Daniel Burroughs, Development of An Undergraduate Security Program\n\nAt the University of Central Florida, an undergraduate program in security is currently being developed. This program will offer students a bachelor's degree through the College of Engineering. It is intended to be an interdisciplinary degree combining coursework from the School of Engineering and Computer Science, College of Health and Public Affairs, and the National Center for Forensic Studies.\n\nThe purpose of this talk is to present the program being developed and to receive feedback regarding what material and what areas such a program should cover. The department that it is being offered through (Engineering Technology) is an applied engineering department, taking a very hands-on approach to learning. As such it is necessary to develop our courses of study based on feedback from industry and the community.\n\nDaniel Burroughs is currently an Assistant Professor in the College of Engineering at the University of Central Florida. His current research involves the development of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Data Sharing Consortium and the development of a undergraduate security engineering program at UCF. His past work at the Institute for Security Technology Studies at Dartmouth College focused on using target tracking techniques to correlate data from multiple IDS and other sensors spread over large scale networks."
