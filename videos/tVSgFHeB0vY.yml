description: "By: Dan Harrelson, Todd Wilkens\n\nAgile developers and UX designers have a lot more in common than you might think. Weâ€™ll show that both agile design and development work best when they integrate and when users are put at the center of the process. Weâ€™ll focus on what works and what doesnâ€™t. Much of this presentation will build off of a national research study on design and development practices as well as case studies from Adaptive Path project teams."
