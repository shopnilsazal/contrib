description: "by Georgi Kodinov (Joro)\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nMost database attackers are after your sensitive data. But there's no easy wayto detect them accessing the data since your application will be accessing ittoo. This is where honey-potting can be really useful. This session willdemonstrate a neat way to do honey-potting using nothing but existing MySQLtools.\n\nWe will demonstrate how one can set up a \"honey-pot table\" and set alarmsaround it in such a way that, when the table is accessed the server will takedecisive actions to limit the session's access and warn the DBA. We will dowith nothing but stock tools available for the MySQL 5.7 server.\n\n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 12:35:00"
