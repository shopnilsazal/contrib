description: "Learning to Empathy by Alex harms\n\nYou've heard empathy is a learned skill. Let's really talk about it. What does it mean to have empathy? Why does it matter, anyway? And if empathy is useful (I hope to show you how it is), how do you get better at it?\n\nIn this session, you'll learn real stuff about what's in your own heart, and how to connect to the people you encounter. Less feeling shitty, more enjoying projects!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HNkR/"
