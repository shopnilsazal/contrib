recordingDate: 1385419946
description: "Tom Stracener & Robert Hansen: Xploiting Google Gadgets: Gmalware and Beyond\nGoogle Gadgets are symptomatic of the Way 2.0 Way of things: from lame gadgets that rotate through pictures of puppies to calendars, and inline email on your iGoogle homepage. This talk will analyze the security history of Google Gadgets and demonstrate ways to exploit Gadgets for nefarious purposes. We will also show ways to create Gadgets that allow you to port scan internal systems and do various JavaScript hacks via malicious (or useful) gadgets, depending on your point of view. We've already ported various JavaScript attack utilities to Google Gadgets (like PDP's JavaScript port scanner) among other things. We will also disclose a zero day vulnerability in Google Gadgets that makes Gmalware (Gmodules based malware) a significant threat.\n\nTom \"strace\" Stracener is Cenzic's Sr. Security Analyst reporting to the office of the CTO. Mr. Stracener was one of the founding members of nCircle Network Security. While at nCircle he served as the head of vulnerability research from 1999 to 2001, developing one of the industry's first quantitative vulnerability scoring systems, and co-inventing several patented technologies. Mr. Stracener is an experienced security consultant, penetration tester, and vulnerability researcher. One of his patents, 'Interoperability of vulnerability and intrusion detection systems,' was granted by the USPTO in October 2005. Tom is the Senior Security Analyst for Cenzic's CIA Labs. Tom has spoken at various conferences including New York Security Conference, ISSA, OWASP, Defcon, and others.\n\nRobert \"RSnake\" Hansen (CISSP) is the Chief Executive Officer of SecTheory.
