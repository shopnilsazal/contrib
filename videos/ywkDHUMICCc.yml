description: "Graffiti: The Coveted Universal Web Component Format by Jay Phelps\n\nWe love Ember, but wouldn't it be great if the components we want or create were host framework agnostic? W3C Web Components aims to do this, but itâ€™s missing a large part of the story. Graffiti fills in these gaps using HTMLBars, ES6/7++ syntax to let you experience the future, now. Kumbaya, all the frameworks can now hold hands."
