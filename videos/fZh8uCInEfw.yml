title: 'Audrey Lim - How a complete beginner learned Go as her first backend language in 5 weeks'
recordingDate: 1438096822
description: 'Go can be seen as a language that is too difficult for beginner programmers. The resources and documentation for the language seem too technically advanced for the beginner to pick up fundamental programming concepts. Nevertheless within 5 weeks of looking into Go I taught myself how to build my first CRUD web application and a week later, an API client. In this talk I will share my thoughts about why I think Go is a fantastic teaching tool, and why beginners should not be afraid to learn it.'
