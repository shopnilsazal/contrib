title: 'Surveillance or Security? The Risks Posed by New Wiretapping Technologies'
recordingDate: 1326427815
description: "Susan Landau, Visiting Scholar, Department of Computer Science, Harvard University\n\nThe United States has moved large portions of business and commerce, including the control of critical infrastructure, onto IP-based networks. This reliance on information systems leaves the US highly exposed and vulnerable to cyberattack, yet US law enforcement remains focused on building wiretapping systems within communications infrastructure. By embedding eavesdropping mechanisms into communications technology itself, we build tools that could easily be turned against us. Indeed, such attacks have already occurred. In a world that has Al-Qaeda, nation-state economic espionage, and Hurricane Katrina, how do we get communications security right?"
