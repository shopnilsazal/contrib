description: "Cyber attacks are a real and growing threat to businesses and an increasing number of attacks take place at application layer. The best defence is to develop applications where security controls are incorporated in development cycle and used by developers while writing their code. How can developers deliver more secure applications? What are the security techniques they can use while writing the software?\n\nThis presentation will discuss the proactive controls that will guide developers down the path of secure software. It will explore the security techniques that can be incorporated in development cycle and will provide real world examples on how to solve some of the most prevalent security problems on the internet.\n\nRecommended to all builders and security professionals interested in incorporating security techniques as part of software development life cycle in the effort to build more secure applications.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
