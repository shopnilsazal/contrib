title: 'LA Ruby Conference 2011 - NinjaScript: JavaScript so unobtrusive, you won''t see it coming.'
recordingDate: 1410804129
description: "NinjaScript is a JS framework, built on jQuery with two principles in mind. #1: Enriching your website with JS behaviors should be as easy as specifying CSS styles. #2: Making your site degrade gracefully without JS shouldn't take any extra work.\n\nNinjaScript provides a simple, CSS-like syntax for applying behaviors, including transformations and event handlers, to your elements. NS handles it from there: as a developer, you won't ever have to think about binding or event delegation again.\n\nIn addition, NinjaScript and its partner gem NinjaHelper make it trivial to build Rails applications that work perfectly with or without JavaScript. At last, true graceful degradation without the suffering.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FNkG/"
