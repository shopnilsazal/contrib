description: "A group of highly-armed individuals has just stormed into your office. They are looking to pull data from your computers which are protected with full disk encryption. In order to prevent your screen saver from activating they will likely immediately insert a mouse jiggler to prevent your screensaver lock from activating. This talk will present ways of detecting and defending against such assaults on your system by mouse jiggler wielding individuals. It will also show you how to build your own simple mouse jiggler. Nothing beyond basic Linux usage is required to understand this talk. Attendees will leave with several ways to defend against mouse jigglers and the knowledge of how to create their own mouse jigglers.\nPhil was born at an early age. He cleaned out his savings as a boy in order to buy a TI99-4A computer for the sum of $450. Two years later he learned 6502 assembly and has been hacking computers and electronics ever since.\n\nDr. Phil currently works as a professor at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania. His research focus over the last few years has been on the use of microcontrollers and small embedded computers for forensics and pentesting. Phil has developed a custom pentesting Linux distro and related hardware to allow an inexpensive army of remote pentesting drones to be built using the BeagleBone Black computer boards. This work is described in detail in Phil's book \"Hacking and Penetration Testing With Low Power Devices\" (Syngress, 2015). Phil has also published books on Linux Forensics (Pentester Academy, 2015), USB Forensics (Pentester Academy, 2016), and Windows Forensics (Pentester Academy, 2016).\n\nPrior to entering academia, Phil held several high level positions at well-known US companies. He holds a couple of the usual certs one might expect for someone in his position. When not working, he likes to spend time with his family, fly, hack electronics (find his Daddy and Daughter Electronics show on YouTube), and has been known to build airplanes."
