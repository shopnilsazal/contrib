description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nPanel Discussion: Containers in Enterprise Cloud Strategy: Pitfalls, Best Practices, and Predictions - Moderated by Anni Lai, Huawei (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nContainer technology promises to help enterprises modernize legacy apps & create cloud-native apps for today’s fast growing digital economy. But, the container ecosystem, built around open src, is still relatively new & evolving at a breakneck pace. CIOs/CTOs today face the need to develop & implement a container strategy, knowing the risks of deploying a still immature technology into production environments that require 0 downtime. This panel will bring together stakeholders from enterprise IT & open src cloud vendors to discuss the role of open src container technologies in their cloud strategies. Panelists will recount challenges & pitfalls faced in deploying containers in production environments & highlight gaps before containers are fully “enterprise ready\", & best practices. Panelists will offer their views on the near future of containers as an enabler of the enterprise cloud.\n\nAbout Brad\nDr. Brad Topol is an IBM DE leading efforts focused on Open Technologies and Developer Advocacy.
