description: "Can You Read Me? Creative JavaScript to Make Computer Science Fun\n\nTwo web developers who are full of curiosity to learn all about machines and code met at a meetup. Unsatisfied with traditional computer science textbook and what we felt like not so learner friendly software engineering landscape, we decided to learn by working together in the format we enjoy the most - creative project.\n\nWe are building machines (both software and hardware) in JavaScript to send secret messages to each other. Different forms of data blob are exchanged periodically as a message. In order to read those messages, each has to learn and build a system to decode the data.\n\nThis talk will tell the story of the machines, their parts, and the possibilities of remote creative collaboration. You’ll come away with fresh inspiration on how JavaScript can be used to learn computer science concepts the enjoyable way.\n\n\nMariko Kosaka\nMariko is an engineer who loves data and knitting. When she is not making software at Scripto, she uses code to help her design textiles & organize a local JavaScript meetup in New York City called BrooklynJS.\n\nSuz Hinton\nSuz Hinton is a JavaScript developer who likes to tinker with hardware. \n\nBeside of being a technical evangelist at Microsoft she's a maker at heart and no stranger to minor burns from soldering irons and 3D printers. She's a regular contributor to the open source Node.js electronics scene, and enjoys teaching others how to immerse themselves in the nerdiverse."
