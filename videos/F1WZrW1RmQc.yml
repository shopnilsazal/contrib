description: "by Andreas Platschek\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nOne of the major challenges for certification in the SIL2LinuxMP project, isto show that Linux does not only define a development process, but alsofollows it. To this end (and far beyond!) the meta-data of commits to theLinux kernel are analyzed.\n\nThe talk covers everything from gathering the data, to distributing it toevery one in the project while keeping it the data up-to-date and of courseour first analysis results. Each of these phases contain their own set ofproblems that needed to be considered, leading to a framework called DLCDM(Development Life-Cylce Data-Mining) that is introduced for the first timeduring this talk.\n\nOne of the major challenges for certification in the SIL2LinuxMP project, isto show that Linux does not only define a development process, but alsofollows it. To this end (and far beyond!) the meta-data of commits to theLinux kernel are analyzed. There are several intended outputs we hope to getout of this analysis, some examples are:\n\n                - Competence of persons involved (IEC 61508-1, 6.2.13/6.2.14)        - Dependencies amongst developers (Independence of persons doing code          reviews)        - Identify patches that did not get enough review (based on patch          complexity, experience of author, reviews, etc.)        - Automatic notification of patches in our configuration        - Bug analysis (based on Fixes: tag)        - Subsystem dependencies and conflicts    \n\nThe talk covers everything from gathering the data, to distributing it toevery one in the project while keeping it the data up-to-date and of courseour first analysis results.
