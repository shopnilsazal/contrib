title: 'Perl6 as a First Language'

recordingDate: 1520511663
description: "by The Merelo Family\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nSo far most presentations of Perl 6 I have seen are addressed to people thatalready know Perl and that are pretty advanced programmers. I want to learnPerl 6 myself, and I also want to create material that can be used to raisepassion for the language when it's used as a first(ish) language. So I haveconvinced my daughters to create a study group where I will prepare materialsand follow a project-based and design-thinking approach to learn Perl 6. Myintention is also to find the way towards a more gender-balanced, inclusivecommunity and test new ways of learning computer programs by eating my own dogfood (as presented in other conferences).\n\nDuring the talk, which will be a dialogue, and maybe staged as a play, we willpresent our experience, what we have learned from it, what we haven't learnedfrom it (hope Perl 6 is not in this category) and how others might benefitfrom it. I am uploading the material to http://github.com/JJ/perl6em, whereyou can see it's still a work in progress.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 09:05:00"
