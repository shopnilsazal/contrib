title: '#HITB2017AMS KEYNOTE 2 - All Fall Down: Interdependencies In The Cloud - Window Snyder'
recordingDate: 1494199742
description: "Cloud providers use cloud providers.\n\nWe’ve created an interconnected system of systems whose failure points increase with each integration. Like a string of dominoes, one outage can easily cause a chain reaction that leaves a trail of disabled sites and services — and business outages and economic impact —  in its wake.  If we’re all dependent on each other, what happens if one of the key players is compromised or unavailable?  How can we make the cloud more resilient?\n\n=== \n\nWindow Snyder is a security industry veteran and Chief Security Officer at Fastly. She previously spent five years at Apple working on security and privacy strategy and features for OS X and iOS. Earlier roles include Chief Security Something-or-Other at Mozilla responsible for security engineering, communication, and strategy and a founding team member at Matasano, a security services and product company based in New York City, acquired by NCC Group in 2012.\n\nAs a senior security strategist at Microsoft in the Security Engineering and Communications organization, she managed the relationships between security consulting companies and the Microsoft product teams and the outreach strategy for security vendors and security researchers. Previously she was responsible for security sign-off for Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003.\n\nMs. Snyder was Director of Security Architecture at @stake. She developed application security analysis methodologies and led the Application Security Center of Excellence. She was a software engineer for 5 years focused primarily on security applications, most recently at Axent Technologies, now Symantec.\n\nMs. Snyder is co-author of Threat Modeling, a manual for security architecture analysis in software."
