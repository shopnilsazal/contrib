recordingDate: 1449057537
description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://gsec.hitb.org/materials/sg2015/\n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\nAppliances powered by FireEye’s Malware Protection System (MPS) are now deployed in almost half of the Fortune 500. Until now public research about these appliances was limited to discussions about potential bypass methods.\n\nIn this talk we will present the architecture of MPS from an attackers point of view and demonstrate a complete remote compromise using vulnerabilities we discovered during this research.\n\nWe will analyze the different components of MPS, show how FireEye’s famous virtualization execution engine works and discuss the attack surface available to an outside attacker.\n\nThe presented vulnerabilities range from command injections in the management web interface over local privilege escalation vulnerabilities to exploits that allow a full compromise of the system by simply sending a malicious file over the network and exploiting bugs in the analysis process.\n\nAll discussed vulnerabilities have been disclosed responsibly to the vendor and all are patched in the interim.\n\nABOUT FELIX WILHELM\n\nFelix is a security researcher working for ERNW GmbH. His main interests are application security, reverse engineering and virtualization security. Felix has disclosed critical vulnerabilities in popular software such as Hyper-V, Xen, Typo3 or IBM GPFS and has presented his work at international conferences like PHDays, Hack in the Box, Infiltrate and Troopers."
