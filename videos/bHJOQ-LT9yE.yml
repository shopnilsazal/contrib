title: 'GeeCON 2017: Andrew Sorensen - Sound Synthesis in the Computational Crucible'
recordingDate: 1502695044
description: 'A crucible allows base metals to be mixed together at high temperatures to form alloys. Medieval alchemists used crucibles to mix an astonishing variety of substances together in the search for new materials. While Alchemy is often derided for its informal approach, early Alchemists paved the wave for modern chemistry, and included Newton and Boyle among their number. Just as the crucible encouraged an experiential and experimental approach to understanding the world, so too the computer can provide a computational crucible. Code can be mixed and brought to great temperature in the search for greater understanding and new discovery. Using his own Extempore programming language Andrew will provide a ``live'''' introduction to sound synthesis, building up the core components of a real-time digital synthesizer on-the-fly ``in the computational crucible''''.'
