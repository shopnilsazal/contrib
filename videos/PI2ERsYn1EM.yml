title: 'ElixirConf 2015 - Breach Your Firewall Using Phoenix Channels by Scott Smith'
recordingDate: 1444843385
description: "You want to perform integration tests on your development computer. As part of testing, you want a 3rd-party sandbox server to send its notifications to your computer, but, alas, your computer is behind a firewall.\n\nIn this session, you will learn how to set up an EC2 instance managed by Phoenix to relay communications bidirectionally between the sandbox and your development computer. See how a Phoenix channel eliminates polling and how an Elixir distribution primitive sets up the channel through the firewall.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HO24/"
