title: 'Rails Conf 2013 Creating Mountable Engines by Patrick Peak'
recordingDate: 1369365683
description: "With Rails 4.0 killing off the humble plugin, there is never a better time to learn how to create reusable code using Engines. Creating an engine can be as simple as adding a model, or a complex as an entire content management system. Using the Asset Pipeline, even javascript and css files can be packaged and shared, making projects cleaner and more maintainable than ever before.\nThis talk will cover how developers can create their own engines, to add new controllers/models/views, rake tasks and/or generators. It will cover how engines can interact with Rails having their own initializers and middleware. Finally, based on our experiences converting BrowserCMS and its entire module ecosystem to work as mountable engines, this talk will cover how to make engines that are designed to work together, extend each other engine's behavior and make it easy for developers to upgrade when you release new versions.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGaF/"
