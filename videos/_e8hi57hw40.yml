Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nKeynote: Shaping the Cloud Native Future - Abby Kearns, Executive Director, Cloud Foundry Foundation\n\nCloud Foundry is an integral part of the movement creating interoperability among the open source, cloud-native ecosystem. Complementary, interlocking open source technologies like Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes and the Open Service Broker API are shifting the way industries function. These technologies weave together flexibility and application development for virtually any type of business. What began as a grassroots movement among developers has mushroomed into a massive collaborative community. Linux laid the groundwork in 1991, and the Linux Foundation continues to host the world&rsquo;s leading open source projects. Today, projects like Cloud Foundry and Cloud Native Computing Foundation, as well as standards like the Open Container Initiative, effectively serve as the voice of the people. The developers creating these projects are defining the next generation of technology infrastructure. In this talk, Abby Kearns will discuss the importance of interoperability, and how it is critical to the future success of technologies. Abby will also discuss the role that open source plays in cloud technologies -- delivering a flexible, scalable strategy to drive the future of business.\n\nAbout Abby\nWith nearly twenty years in the tech world, Abby Kearns is a true veteran of the industry.
