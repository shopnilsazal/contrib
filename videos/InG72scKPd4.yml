title: 'GopherCon 2015: Derek Parker - Delve Into Go'
recordingDate: 1438096775
description: "A good debugger is an essential tool for any software engineer – but Go has some unique characteristics (the runtime scheduler, for instance) that make traditional debuggers unfeasible. So I wrote Delve, a debugger tailored specifically for Go.\n\nWhen your software misbehaves, how can you glean insight into its unruliness?\n\nTo answer that we’ll take a deep dive into Delve. We’ll explore what makes software like Delve work, how it aims to solve problems with existing debuggers, and how you can leverage Delve."
