description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup: Victoria Mazo | Generative Adversarial Networks\n\nPyData Tel Aviv Meetup #3\n5 April 2017\nSponsored and hosted by Taboola\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a promising framework for unsupervised learning. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, which learn together by pursuing competing goals. From a conceptual perspective, adversarial training is fascinating because it bypasses the need of loss functions in learning, and opens the door to new ways of regularizing (as well as fooling or attacking) learning machines. In this talk GANs basics are explained and a lot of examples of their usage are provided.\n\ncode: https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow/blob/master/model.py\n\npresentation: https://github.com/victoriamazo/victoriamazo.github.io/raw/master/GANs.pptx\n\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData brings together both users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The goals are to provide data science enthusiasts, across various domains, a place to discuss how best to apply languages and tools to the challenges of data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.\n\nPyData is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) charity in the United States. www.numfocus.org"
