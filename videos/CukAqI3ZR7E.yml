title: 'Taming Android Studio Layout Editing - Vadim Caen, Diego Perez'
recordingDate: 1528997839
description: "Android Studio provides powerful tools to help you develop your application user interface. With all the capabilities of Android Studio, there's a lot to discover for developers. Android app design needs are more and more complex: shadows, animations, illustrations, dynamic content, this talk will cover how you can use the available tools in the IDE to get the most out of them. Along the way we will highlight some of the best practices and show how to avoid common pitfalls in order to create complex yet lightweight layouts.\n\nWe'll show how to use Android Studio to get the best possible experience when developing complex UIs used in real world applications. We will go through how to use the Layout Editor to compose the layouts, how it integrates with the ConstraintLayout and other existing libraries and how to extract the maximum from Android Studio design tools. We'll also show how to quickly use the preview and the new Sample Data feature to reduce the development time by avoiding deploying to real devices as much as possible.\nWe will also cover new approaches such as ConstraintLayout to craft flexible user interfaces quickly.\n\nThe aim of this talk is to allow developers already using Android Studio to increase their productivity and to showcase some of the lesser known and new features."
