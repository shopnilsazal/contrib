recordingDate: 1417633518
description: "This is the story of how I built an all-seeing eye with Ruby, and how I use it to defend the sanctity of my suburban home.\n\nUsing a Raspberry Pi and some homemade motion detection software I've developed a home security system that can send me notifications on my phone and photograph intruders. It uses perceptual hashes to detect image changes and archives anything unusual. I can even set a custom alerting threshold and graph disturbances over time.\n\nIf you've ever had the desire to be an evil wizard with a glowing fireball of an eye this talk is perfect for you. Come play with Sauron.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FjVl/"
