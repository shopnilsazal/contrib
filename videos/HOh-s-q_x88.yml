title: 'GeeCON 2017: Pavel Lahoda - Advanced Android Annotations for AAA Mobile applications'
recordingDate: 1502694957
description: 'Android development is hectic area where new technologies and APIs appear at a record pace, applications often require very tight deadlines and agile approach of endless iterations towards perfection, where we are only equipped with old trusted Java language to deal with all this madness. While some say Java is nearing the expiry date and is a problematic choice for modern mobile platform, there are few tricks left in the sleeve that can help poor mobile Java developer to be more productive problem solver in this world of chaos. This talk will focus on Java Annotations and their usage for Android development specifically. We will go through both runtime Annotation handling using reflection and compile time Annotation Processors, see how we can utilize this knowledge to build synoptic, concise code that plays well with the Android platform. We will have quick outline how popular libraries embrace Java Annotations to tackle various real world problems, such as networking calls or persistence. Special consideration will be given to various design and architectural patterns, often thoughtlessly transferred from the Java Enterprise, where they might be poor match for mobile development for Android and how Annotations might help simplify developers life together with making the application more robust. The talk assumes only a basic knowledge of mobile Android development, there will be many easy to understand examples to illustrate the concepts that will be presented.'
