description: "by Federico Capoano\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nOpenWISP2 is a simple web app composed of several reusable python librariesand django apps. Having learnt from the experience with OpenWISP1, the newversion of the controller has been redesigned to be more flexible, reusable,modularly built and easier to deploy.\n\nIts goal is to make it easier to maintain a network of devices based onOpenWRT/LEDE.\n\nCurrent features\n\n  * configuration management for embedded devices supporting different firmwares: OpenWRT/LEDE and OpenWISP Firmware  * support for additional firmware can be added by specifying custom backends  * configuration editor based on JSON-Schema editor  * advanced edit mode: edit NetJSON DeviceConfiguration objects for maximum flexibility  * configuration templates: reduce repetition to the minimum  * configuration context: reference ansible-like variables in the configuration  * simple HTTP resources: allow devices to automatically download configuration updates  * VPN management: easily create VPN servers and clients\n\nProject goals\n\n  * automate configuration management for embedded devices  * allow to minimize repetition by using templates  * make it easy to integrate in larger django projects to improve reusability  * make it easy to extend its models by providing abstract models  * provide ways to support more firmwares by adding custom backends  * keep the core as simple as possible  * provide ways to extend the default behaviour  * encourage new features to be published as extensions\n\nYou can find the video projected during the talk here:[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY097Y2cPQ0&list=PLPueLZei9c8_DEYgC5StOcR5bCAcQVfR8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY097Y2cPQ0&list=PLPueLZei9c8_DEYgC5StOcR5bCAcQVfR8)\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 14:00:00"
