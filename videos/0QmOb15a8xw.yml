description: "Insteon home automation devices communicate via proprietary protocols riding over powerlines and sub-gigahertz RF. While Insteon has been making homes smarter for a decade, reverse engineering of the protocol by security professionals has only recently begun.? At DEF CON 23 Peter Shipley reverse engineered much of the Insteon wireless protocol, demonstrated that Insteon's public whitepaper was largely bogus, and that there was no evidence of network security. We agree with Joshua Wright that \"\"Security does not improve until tools for practical exploration of the attack surface become available,\"\" so we set out to build such tools for Insteon. In this presentation we'll show how Shipley got it (mostly) right about the Insteon protocol, while also showing off significantly more advanced tools for sniffing and traffic injection. These tools include a powerful Wireshark dissector and a network scanner/enumerator.\n\nBios:\nCaleb Mays is an academic researcher in wireless security with a focus on Insteon home automation networks and their enigmatic, proprietary protocol. He has been a network security professional for five years with experience in computer programming, enterprise network administration, and communications planning.\n\nBen Ramsey, PhD, CISSP, has over a decade of experience in network security research. His work focuses on critical infrastructure protection and low power wireless protocols, such as ZigBee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth Low Energy, and Insteon. He has published in several academic journals and has presented research at multiple conferences, including GLOBECOM, MILCOM, SenseApp, and ShmooCon."
