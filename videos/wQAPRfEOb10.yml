description: "Daniel Pope - Writing Domain Specific Languages with Python\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nPython is an expressive general purpose programming language. Its\nsyntax provides many ways to represent structure and minimise code\nrepetition and boilerplate.\n\nBut Python not always expressible enough. Perhaps when you've built a\ncomplicated enough system with hard-to-express inter-relationships,\nthe code required to construct or operate on it can become\ncomplicated, repetitive and unreadable. Or perhaps you have users\nunfamiliar with Python who need to understand or edit a system. In\ncases like these, stepping beyond the syntax and semantics of basic\nPython can be an advantage.\n\nDaniel will describe various ways you can  implement your own Domain\nSpecific Languages, languages perhaps completely unlike Python that\ncan succinctly describe more complicated Python systems.\n\nThis talk will cover:\n\n* What and why of DSLs\n* Metaprogramming tricks\n* Writing simple parsers\n* The libraries PLY and PyParsing\n* Building tooling around your new DSLs"
