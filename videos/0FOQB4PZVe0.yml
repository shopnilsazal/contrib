title: 'Privsep: A New Security Isolation Mechanism for OpenStack by Angus Lees'
recordingDate: 1439723140
description: "OpenStack listens to requests over the network, and (when appropriate) performs operations on the host that require root superpowers.  Following best-practice design, most of the code runs as an unprivileged user and only the code that needs additional powers runs as root using a tool called \"rootwrap\".\n\nThis talk discusses the evolution that led to the current rootwrap design, why it has proven to be completely inadequate in practice, and presents a new \"privsep\" alternative currently being worked on within Oslo.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nJuly 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
