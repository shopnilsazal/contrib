description: "Glenn Block\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/dotnetfringe/sdktrd/\nFor years I was looking for the holy grail of C# development, being able to code outside of VS and in a text editor. Granted this was further influenced by 4 years of node development where Sublime Text was my tool of choice. This desire for a node-like experience led to scriptcs. With scriptcs you CAN write C#, use Nuget and do it all from outside of an IDE in Sublime Text.\nscriptcs is much more than a personal passion project. Early on I joined up with a merry band of coordinators and we decided to take this thing forward. The community response was amazing, we&#39;ve had tons of forks and contributors. scriptcs is spreading in small companies, enterprises and more. You might even see it in the box of VS one day!\nIn this talk I&#39;ll discuss our adventures in growing the project, working with an amazing and diverse contributor community, and the adventures we enabled with our fun tool."
