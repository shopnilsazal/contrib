title: 'Droidcon Italy 2017 // Client and server, 3 meters above the Cloud - Matteo Ferroni'
recordingDate: 1493828478
description: 'In an era where we can connect everything everywhere, no client is an island entire of itself: every client is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. From mainframes to IoT and the cloud above, paradigms keeps on changing: who is the client and who is the server? Who can fail and who can not? Where is data? What is the fog? The Internet is changing and so are devices: this talk aims at bringing some concepts from distributed systems (e.g., caching, discovery, circuit breakers, distributed transactions, microservices) to mobile and IoT developers, as they are not just clients: they are part of the Internet as we know it.'
