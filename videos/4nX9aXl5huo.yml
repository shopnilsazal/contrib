description: "5 years after ruby programming language came into vogue(1995), bioruby came into existence in 2000, both developed in Japan. BioRuby project provides an integrated environment in bioinformatics for the Ruby language. This project is supported by University of Tokyo (Human Genome Center), Kyoto University (Bioinformatics Center) and the Open Bio Foundation.\n\nOn one hand we have the Bioinformatics, the large database of the huge genome sequences, the search algorithms to search the gene similarity between different organisms, gene-mutations using the popular search tool Blast, Fasta etc. BioRuby helps us to do the same searching thing using ruby programming language. As ruby is a pure object-oriented programming language(everything in ruby is an object) and being a easy to read and write, it's fun to use here without being lost in the plethora of genomic data.\n\nLearn about the genes, which controls everything you do and find out how you can ease the task of your similarity with a mouse, and I am not kidding! Welcome to the ruby in the living world, integrating ruby with the Bioinformatics and have fun.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8q/"
