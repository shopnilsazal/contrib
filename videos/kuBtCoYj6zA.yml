recordingDate: 1385525039
description: "Accidental Abyss: Data Leakage on The Internet - Kelly FitzGerald\n\nPII is personally identifiable information.  In the information age, seemingly useless bits of PII can be found everywhere on the web from Facebook to Amazon to county records.  Using purely legal methods and nothing more than artful searching I will show you the art of the low-tech, high-targeted recon.  How much of your identity is scattered around on the internet?   \n\nIn this ambitious talk we will look at better hacking through television, how to combine crumbs to build thorough dossiers and learn some tricks on how to do some basic information reconnaissance.  By the end of the talk you'll have some frightening statistics, something good to think about and some tools that will make you a more effective social engineer, an aware user and a more thoughtful security expert.\n\n\nSpeaker\n\nKelly FitzGerald\nKelly has a BS in Computer Science from CSUSB. She was awarded a full academic scholarship from the National Science Foundation. In her senior year of college she took a job at EvidentData doing computer forensics. From there she fell in love with the dark side and purposely went in persuit of a career in computer security looking at the bleedy places where people and technology bruise. Kelly has worked at Symantec since 2003 and has two single-filer patents pending.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
