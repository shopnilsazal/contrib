Are you sure? How do you know?\n\nThe current state of security in Industrial Control Systems is a widely publicized issue, but fixes to ICS security issues are long cycle, with some systems and devices that will unfortunately never have patches available. In this environment, visibility into security threats to ICS is critical, and almost all of ICS monitoring has been focused on compliance, rather than looking for indicators/evidence of compromise. The non-intrusive nature of Network Security Monitoring (NSM) is a perfect fit for ICS. This presentation will show how NSM should be part of ICS defense and response strategy, various options for implementing NSM, and some of the capabilities that NSM can bring to an ICS security program. Free tools such as Security Onion, Snort IDS, Bro IDS, NetworkMiner, and Wireshark will be used to look at the ICS environment for anomalies. It will be helpful if attendees have read these books (but they aren't required): The Cuckoo's Egg by Cliff Stoll, The Practice of Network Security Monitoring by Richard Bejtlich, and Applied Network Security Monitoring by Chris Sanders and Jason Smith.\n\nChris Sistrunk is a Senior Consultant at Mandiant, focusing on cyber security for industrial control systems (ICS) and critical infrastructure. Prior to joining Mandiant, Chris was a Senior Engineer at Entergy (over 11 years) where he was the Subject Matter Expert (SME) for SCADA systems. He has 10 years of experience in SCADA systems with tasks such as standards development, system design, database configuration, testing, commissioning, troubleshooting, and training. He was the co-overseer of the SCADA, relay, and cyber security labs at Entergy for 6 years. Chris has been working with Adam Crain of Automatak on Project Robus, an ICS protocol fuzzing project that has found and helped fix many implementation vulnerabilities in DNP3, Modbus, and Telegyr 8979.\n\nChris helped organize the first ICS Village, which debuted at DEF CON 22.\n\nHe is a Senior Member of IEEE, Mississippi Infragard President, member of the DNP Users Group, and also is a registered PE in Louisiana. He holds a BS in Electrical Engineering and MS in Engineering and Technology Management from Louisiana Tech University. Chris also founded and organizes BSidesJackson, Mississippi's only cyber security conference.\n\nTwitter: @chrissistrunk \nhttps://www.facebook.com/chrissistrunk"
