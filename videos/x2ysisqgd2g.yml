title: 'LFE: A Real Lisp in the Erlang Ecosystem by Robert Virding'
recordingDate: 1474972143
description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/robert-virding\n\nWhy yet another lisp? This talk will look at some of the basic properties of the Erlang VM and OTP and how they affect implementing languages on it. It will show what makes existing lisps, even Clojure, a bad fit. LFE (Lisp Flavoured Erlang) has been designed to run efficiently on the Erlang VM and at the same time be a \"real lisp\" providing Lisp's good bits. We will describe the language and how it uses the properties of the system to run efficiently and interact seamlessly with other languages running in the Erlang environment."
