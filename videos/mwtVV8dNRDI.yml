description: "DEFCON 1 - A Personal Account\nDead Addict\n\nAs time slips away, so do the memories of cons past.\n\nIn this talk I'm going to talk about DC1, its planning, execution, components, and challenges.\n\nI'll give snippets of seemingly practical advise; don't design T-shirts with lots of dense text on the back, no matter how clever. I'll discuss of obvious misjudgments; don't invite both the prosecutor and the subject of an active prosecution without warning the parties. I'll also have some minor show and tell: first badge, first T-shirt copies of DC1 tapes, sketch of original DC1 logo.\n\nWith luck some old DC1 speakers will show up as well.\n\nDead Addict first started writing bio's 16 years ago. his first bio alluded to crimes he had recently committed, and not much else - he was but a teenager at the time. more recent bio's have confessed to many years serving multinational corporations. he has been attempting to write clever and witty bio's for almost two decades, unfortunately consistently falling short. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
