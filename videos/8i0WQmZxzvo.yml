description: "Back in My Day... by Bryan Liles\n\nBryan Liles works on strategic initiatives for DigitalOcean. In layperson's terms, this means he writes open source software for DigitalOcean and others. He helps communities move their software to the public cloud, and gets to speak at conferences on topics ranging from machine learning to building the next generation of developers. When not thinking about code, Bryan races cars in straight lines and around turns, and builds robots and devices.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HOB0/"
