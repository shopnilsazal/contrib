To get a real benefit for your interns and your project,positive, active mentoring must take place.\n\nMentoring is a complex exercise for both the mentors and the mentored. It'snot \"management\"--it's guidance. It's setting the mentored on a path that willnot only solve a specific problem but share information and knowledge gainedby the mentor over years of experience. In this presentation, Brian Proffittwill explain best practices for being a good mentor, setting up scope-appropriate projects, and troubleshooting when things start going off theplan.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.119 (Moved from AW1.124)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 10:20:00"
