description: 'Machine Learning for Display Advertising @ Scale: In this talk, we will briefly introduce the display advertising marketplace, its stakeholders and the key performance metrics. We will then present the models we have developed at Criteo for bidding in real-time auctions, product recommendation, and look & feel optimization at scale (1B+ monthly users, 3B+ products in our catalog, and 30K ad displayed / sec at peak traffic). For these tasks, we’ve moved over time from predicting rare, binary events (clicks) to predicting very rare events (sales) and continuous events (sales amounts), all of them being quite noisy, and we’ll discuss the different methods that we have tried to build these models (such as generalized linear models, trees or factorization machines). We’ll continue by discussing how we evaluate these models both offline and online. We will describe the infrastructure for large-scale distributed data processing that these algorithms rely upon and discuss different optimization techniques we have experimented with (such as SGD, L-BFGS, SVRG). Finally, we will conclude with future areas of research and discuss open challenges we are currently facing.”'
