description: "By, Helena Edelson\nIn this talk we will step into Spark over Cassandra with Spark Streaming and Kafka. Then put it in the context of an event-driven Akka application for real-time delivery of meaning at high velocity. We will do this by showing how to easily integrate Apache Spark and Spark Streaming with Apache Cassandra and Apache Kafka using the Spark Cassandra Connector. All within a common use case: working with time-series data, which Cassandra excells at for data locality and speed.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FnIV/"
