language: English
recordingDate: 1480452710
description: 'Channels is the most exciting thing to happen to Django since, well, Django! It is both an elegant and backwards compatible extension of the core Django request response model to allow direct support of WebSockets and lightweight async tasks. This talk will cover the current state of Channels, work through an asynchronous task example, touch on deployment and point towards other resources.'
