description: "By Matt Aimonetti, Bryan Helmkamp and Bryan Liles\n\nRuby is a rich language with dark corners. Over the years, we have been exploring more and more of these corners. But taking a step back, it's now obvious to me that there is no such thing as bad Ruby code. As programmers, we have a natural tendency to focus on code syntax, concepts and tools. But maybe we are missing the point. My talk will be in two parts: First, I will present my opinion on \"bad\" Ruby code and in the second, Bryan Helmkamp and Bryan Liles will join me on stage to discuss their own experience and share concrete recommendations.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG5I/"
