title: 'AppSec EU 2017 Dangerous Optimizations And The Loss Of Causality by Robert C  Seacord'
language: English

description: "Increasingly, compiler writers are taking advantage of undefined  behaviors in the C and C++ programming languages to improve  optimizations. Frequently, these optimizations are interfering with the  ability of developers to perform cause-effect analysis on their source  code, that is, analyzing the dependence of downstream results on prior  results. Consequently, these optimizations are eliminating causality in  software and are increasing the probability of software faults, defects,  and vulnerabilities. This presentation describes some common  optimizations, describes how these can lead to software vulnerabilities,  and identifies applicable and practical mitigation strategies.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
