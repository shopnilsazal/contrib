recordingDate: 1513372492
description: "From Monolith to Microservices with Kubernetes and Linkerd - Mason Jones, Credit Karma\n\nAfter about eight years, Credit Karma had built up an impressive tech infrastructure...based on a PHP monolith. Over the past 18 months we’ve (carefully) adopted Docker, Linkerd, Consul, Kubernetes, and more as we shifted to microservices in order to enable continued engineering innovation. This is the story of our evolution from monolith to microservices, starting with our own homegrown tools. The talk will cover our iterations from basic plumbing to dynamic service discovery; why we started using Linkerd and selected Kubernetes; and how we evolved our systems step by step while continuing to serve 75 million members.\n\nAbout Mason Jones\nMason leads Credit Karma’s infrastructure services team. His team's work provides a foundation for Credit Karma's microservices to enable our 75 million members and financial institution partners in the U.S. and Canada to use data to guide their financial decisions. Before joining Credit Karma, Mason spent more than 20 years as a technical executive at startups throughout Silicon Valley. He specializes in migrating technical organizations to microservices, securing build pipelines and creating self-service tools to empower development teams. When Mason isn’t shipping code, he manages Charnel Music, an independent record label he founded."
