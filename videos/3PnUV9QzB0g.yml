description: "RailsConf 2017: Rack ‘em, Stack ‘em Web Apps by Jason Clark\n\nWhile Rails is the most common Ruby web framework, it’s not the only option. Rack is a simple, elegant HTTP library, ideal for microservices and high performance applications.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll see Rack from top to bottom. Starting from the simplest app, we’ll grow our code into a RESTful HTTP API. We’ll test our code, write reusable middleware, and dig through what Rack provides out of the box. Throughout, we’ll balance when Rack is a good fit, and when larger tools are needed.\n\nIf you’ve heard of Rack but wondered where it fits in the Ruby web stack, here’s your chance!"
