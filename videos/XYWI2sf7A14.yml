description: "Monitoring Kubernetes: Follow the Data [B] - Ilan Rabinovitch, Datadog\n\nAt Datadog we help thousands of organizations monitor their infrastructure and applications. In this session, we’ll dive deeper into the several hundred trillion data points we’ve gathered to extract information about the real-world use of Kubernetes and see trends in container and orchestrator usage.\n\nAs we look at Kubernetes and container usage data, we’ll also discuss the top applications being used in orchestrated environments and, using the data, provide insight into which metrics you should watch and how to troubleshoot based on those metrics. In this session, we will also look at a framework for your metrics and how to use it to find solutions to the issues that come up.\n\nWe will cover the three types of monitoring data; what to collect; what should trigger an alert (avoiding an alert storm and pager fatigue); and how to follow the resources to find the root causes of problems.\n\nAlthough the real-world Kubernetes and container use data is derived from Datadog users, the focus of this session is not tool specific, so attendees will leave with strategies and frameworks they can implement in their container-based environments today regardless of the platforms and tools they use.\n\nAbout Ilan Rabinovitch\nIlan Rabinovitch leads the community and product teams at Datadog. He spends his days diving into container monitoring metrics, collaborating with Datadog's open-source community and evangelizing observability best practices.\n\nPreviously, Ilan spent a number of years leading infrastructure and reliability engineering teams at organizations such as Ooyala and Edmunds.com. He’s active in the open source and DevOps communities, where he is a co-organizer of events such as SCALE, Texas Linux Fest, and multiple DevOpsDays events."
