description: "Ruby Community: Awesome; Could Be Awesomer   by: Marty Haught\n\nWe are known for our community. Does this mean our job is done? Are we starting to stagnate? Simply gathering Rubyists together isn't enough. How are you improving your community? Fear not as anyone of you can take action. Whether you live in a place with no organized Ruby meet-ups or you're contemplating a big regional event, we will go over why you should take action and give you practical steps to do so. We'll also bring light to not just increasing membership counts but actively making everyone better. Innovation is happening out there that we'll go over in detail. Join us, learn and get involved -- we're building something awesome!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GtjB/"
