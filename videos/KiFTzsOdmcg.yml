description: "By Ashe Dryden\n\nThe state of diversity in open source contributions is abysmal. With the number of female OSS contributors at a shockingly low 1.5% and other groups not even documented, we need to ask what we can be doing better as a community. We'll discuss the barriers that people face contributing to our open source projects and what we can do to increase participation.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG3r/"
