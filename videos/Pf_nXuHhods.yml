description: "By Coraline Ada Ehmke\n\nAgile companies need timely and reliable access to data to make critical business decisions. In the enterprise world, this is accomplished with expensive and esoteric data warehousing solutions, while younger organizations make do with generic analytics platforms. In this talk I will introduce an agile approach to business intelligence that drives decision support, feeds data analysis, and delivers flexible reporting capabilities. \n\nWe will explore the complete architecture of a lightweight BI system that is used in the real world to capture and analyze customer information, monitor user behaviour, feed machine-learning algorithms for decision support, and deliver real knowledge and value to business stakeholders.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG3P/"
