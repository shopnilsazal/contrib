description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #11\n7 January 2018\nSponsored by Via, Hosted by Google Campus\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nWe live in an online world. As consumers we expect our demands to be answered on the spot, and as creators we design our products to answer consumers' immediate requests. In Via (https://ridewithvia.com/), for example, the minute you ask for a ride, you will be assigned a van - a live imitation of a greedy algorithm. But what if the algorithm had the input that in a minute from now I will also ask for a ride with similar origin and destination? then it will be able to optimize the assignment - it will keep you waiting for just a minute, so that we can ride together, even more cheaply and economically than ever!\nTo address this issue, we will talk about a project I lead in Via, where the goal was to imagine we knew all requests in advance, and make the best assignment to vans based on this \"omniscience\". I will use this project to present a python package I used (networkx) and discovered some cool stuff about, and will share with you the exciting data-exploration of the results.\n\nA mathematician at heart, an algorithmatician in practice. After receiving my MSc. in math from TAU I ventured into data science and algorithms domains, glad to discover that the real world is at least as exciting as the abstract. Currently algorithms researcher at Via - On Demand Transit, applying both my theoretical and practical passions.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
