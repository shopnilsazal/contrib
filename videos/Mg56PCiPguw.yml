description: "By, Marconi Lanna\n\nProgramming in Scala, by Martin Odersky et al., is one of the most comprehensive and the de facto reference for Scala.\n\nHowever, the book, originally published in 2008 for Scala 2.7.2, has not been updated since its second edition in 2010, covering up until Scala 2.8.1. In the meantime, Scala had 3 major releases with numerous fresh and advanced features.\n\nWhile we wait for a third edition of Programming in Scala to describe all the latest and greatest Scala features introduced in the last 4 years, this talk presents the main features introduced in Scala 2.9, 2.10, and 2.11:\n\nParallel collections\nValue classes, implicit classes, and extension methods\nString interpolation\nFutures and Promises\nAkka actors\nMacros and quasiquotes\nReflection\nModularization\nDynamic types\nError handling with Try\nThe App trait\nNew methods in collections\nCase classes with more than 22 parameters\nPredef.???\nsbt incremental compilation\n2.12 and beyond: what's in Scala future?\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FoG1/"
