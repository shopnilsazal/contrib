title: 'Bart Baddeley - Measuring Similarity & Clustering Data'
recordingDate: 1397475981
description: "http://www.slideshare.net/PyData/measuring-similarity-and-clustering-data-bart-baddeley\n\nClustering data is a fundamental technique in data mining and machine learning. The basic problem can be specified as follows: \"Given a set of data, partition the data into a set of groups so that each member of a given group is as similar as possible to the other members of that group and as dissimilar as possible to members of other groups\". In this talk I will try to unpack some of the complexities inherent in this seemingly straightforward description. Specifically, I will discuss some of the issues involved in measuring similarity and try to provide some intuitions into the decisions that need to be made when using such metrics to cluster data."
