description: "by Nikolai Kondrashov\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nNow, when many IT-related services are delegated to external parties,government, medical, financial, and other organizations need tight tracking ofwhat users and administrators do on their critical systems. Up to recordingeverything they see on the screen, the commands they execute, and files theyaccess.\n\nIn this presentation Nikolai Kondrashov will review available solutions foruser session recording, open-source and otherwise, their benefits andshortcomings, and will present a new effort to create an integrated Open-Source solution.\n\nWhile there are many capable solutions for session recording, which cancentrally collect, search and playback sessions, there is no such open-sourcecode. The best we have is jump servers with script(1), or sudo I/O logging,all manually set up. This presentation will show an approach that would meetthe needs of the modern enterprise.\n\nThe presentation will include a demo of a user session and accompanying databeing recorded, stored centrally, inspected and played back.\n\nThe intended audience is developers of security, identity and policymanagement systems, as well as system administrators and security officersresponsible for maintaining critical systems and preventing insider attacks.\n\n\nRoom: K.1.105 (La Fontaine)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 15:00:00"
