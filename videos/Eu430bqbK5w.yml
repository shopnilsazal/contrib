description: "\"My First Petabyte: Now What?\", by Jacob Farmer, Cambridge Computer\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this video are those of the speaker(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the USENIX Association.**\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about a person's age, the chic expression is that 30 is the new 20. When we talk about data storage, it's tempting to say that the petabyte is the new terabyte. Many organizations now have a petabyte, large corporations have several petabytes, and content repositories have hundreds of petabytes. The reality is that the technologies for moving and managing data have not kept pace with ballooning capacities. The major problem areas include: navigating a name space with hundreds of millions of files; backup and restore; replication, fail-over, and fail-back; life cycle management; and migrations and hardware refreshes. This session explores these problem areas and describes various solutions."
