description: "Every day the trivago hotel search website enables millions of users to find their ideal hotel in over 190 countries. With over 50 active locales and annual traffic growth of over 40%, maintaining optimal web performance is key to trivago's success as a business.\n\nIn emerging markets, maintaining optimal web performance can become a challenge: varying network conditions and different device topology cause issues. Thanks to trivago's rigorous testing culture, we identified these issues in one of our key emerging markets. We ran comparative tests to improve performance, tied the resulting data to trivago's business metrics and correlated it to conversions, more page interactions and a significant increase in new users.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn how trivago measures performance, how we run complex multivariate tests to calculate the business value of engineering and how we optimised performance for one of our key emerging markets."
