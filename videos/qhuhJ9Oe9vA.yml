description: 'In this talk, we''ll be exploring how wireless communication works. We''ll capture digital data live (with Software-Defined Radio), and see how the actual bits are transmitted. From here, we''ll see how to view, listen to, manipulate, and replay wireless signals. We''ll also look at interrupting wireless communication, and finally, we''ll even generate new radio waves from scratch (which can be useful for fuzzing and brute force attacks). I''ll also be demoing some brand new tools I''ve written to help in the interception, manipulation, and generation of digital wireless signals with SDR.'
