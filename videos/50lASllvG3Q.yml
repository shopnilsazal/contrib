description: "Droidcon Paris 2015\nApple has introduced “a better language” for iOS developers. But what options do we have for Android? Surely Kotlin should be under consideration! Android Studio is now based on Intellij Idea, the “native” environment for Kotlin.\n\nKotlin is a modern language for industry. It can help you reduce the amount of code you write for Android applications and at the same time make it readable and more maintainable.\n\nIn this session we are going to talk a bit why JetBrains sees the potential in Kotlin comparing to other JVM languages. Then we’ll see how certain language constructs can be used to make Android more enjoyable. Also we’ll look at a DSL for type-safe dynamic layouts and a simple extension plugin that helps to avoid writing ‘findViewById()’ all the time. \n\nSlides: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1CCib0JzAOJVXdaejZJVHhGaVU\n\nDroidcon Paris 2015, more information here: http://droidcon.fr/schedule/"
