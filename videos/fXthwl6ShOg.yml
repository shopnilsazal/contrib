title: 'DEF CON 24 - Ulf Frisk - Direct Memory Attack the Kernel'
language: English
recordingDate: 1479078066
description: "Inexpensive universal DMA attacking is the new reality of today! In this talk I will explore and demonstrate how it is possible to take total control of operating system kernels by DMA code injection. Once control of the kernel has been gained I will execute code and dump gigabytes of memory in seconds. Full disk encryption will be defeated, authentication will be bypassed and shells will be spawned. This will all be made possible using a $100 piece of hardware together with the easy to use modular PCILeech toolkit - which will be published as open source after this talk.\n\nBio:\nUlf Frisk is a penetration tester working in the Swedish financial sector. Ulf focuses mainly on online banking security solutions, penetration testing and it-security audits during daytime and low-level coding during nighttime. Ulf has been working professionally with security since 2011 and has a dark past as a developer."
