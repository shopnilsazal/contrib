description: "You've probably already read the GitHub blog post on Unicorn and \"Zero Downtime Deploys\" and would like to try it out for your application(s). This talk will cover the particular particulars of making this work. Detailed discussion will be given on our Unicorn, NGINX, Runit, RVM, Capistrano and Chef changes that needed to be made in order to make this work reliably. Approaches to migrations and schema changes will also be discussed. Even if your stack differs slightly, the salient points should be applicable. Once you have zero downtime deploys working, you'll wonder why you ever did deploys any other way. Say goodbye to cap deploy:maintenance. Secrets will be revealed!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8w/"
