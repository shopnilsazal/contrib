description: "Bruce Potter, Tony 'Xam' Kapela & Adam Shand - Wireless Networking\nWireless networks have seen explosive growth in the last year. Wardriving a city last July resulted in only a handful of access points. Now there are hundreds if not thousands of access points in every city in the nation. And during the same time holes have been shot in all major wireless security protocols. People deploying wireless technologies are either unaware of the risk involved or have decided the productivity gain out weighs the risk. We feel it is more of the former than the later. This presentation will discuss contemporary issues in wireless network security. While we will discuss some of the basic foundations of wireless security such as WEP, the talk will be more focused on the state of the art. The speakers all have heavy backgrounds in community wireless networking using open standards and living in hostile environments. They will draw upon their knowledge to give the audience an idea of where they can expect wireless security to go in the next year.\n\nTony Kapela (aka: Xam) -- Asside from being a full-time student in Madison, Wisconsin, Tony choses to spend part of his free time thinking about wireless systems and mesh networking. His more recent projects include \"MeshMadison\" -- a network aimed at open community transport, supporting transparent roaming in downtown Madison. His other interests include ethernet adultry, HPNA acrobatics, and playing drums.\n\nBruce Potter -- Bruce is the founder of the Shmoo group of security professionals (www.shmoo.com). He is also the founder of the NoVAWireless community wireless network group in Northern Virginia. He has a soon-to-be published book on Wireless Network Security with O'Reilly.\n\nAdam Shand -- Adam started PersonalTelco in November 2000 due to a happy series of coincidences. He believes that information wants to be free despite the fact that people want to be paid."
