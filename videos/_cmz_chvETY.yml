description: 'Apache Spark’s MLlib is a terrific library for fitting large-scale machine learning models. However, translating high-level problem statements like “learn a classifier” into a working model presently requires significant manual effort (via ad hoc parameter tuning) and computational resources (to fit several models). We present our work on the MLbase optimizer – a system designed on top of Spark to quickly and automatically search through a hyperparameter space and find a good model. By leveraging performance enhancements, better search algorithms, and statistical heuristics, our system offers an order of magnitude speedup over standard methods.'
