As the performance of Android device has increased, it's become possible to implement such a concept in Android systems. We will demonstrate how to implement this concept. In addition, we will also give a demo to show that a PoC virus can infect normal APK files in a real Android mobile phone.\n\nBob Pan mainly focuses on mobile platform security domain(including Android/iOS platforms). He likes reverse-engineering and contributes to opensource. He is the owner of dex2jar (http://code.google.com/p/dex2jar/) which is one of most popular tools in the android security industry.\n\nNow he works as a Mobile Security Research Engineer at TrendMicro."
