description: "by Erik Helin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe G1 garbage collector is currently proposed to become the default garbagecollector in JDK 9. Recently three new ideas for G1 were described on thehotspot-gc-dev at openjdk.java.net mailing list: \\- parallel full GC \\-throughput write barriers \\- rebuilding remembered sets during concurrent mark\n\nThis talk will present these three new ideas so that people who are interestedin getting into G1 development know where to start, see what the existing codelooks like today and highlight how one can contribute (it is not only aboutcode!).\n\nThe presentation can be made longer if people want to dive deeper into thedetails (but it can also fit in a 25 minute slot).\n\n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 13:30:00"
