description: "\"Music is a world within itself, with a language we all understand\" said Stevie Wonder. That sounds a lot like programming! The parallels between music and software development are striking, and understanding how they intersect can teach us a lot about how we can improve our code, our craft, and our joy in how we approach our work.\n\nIn this talk, which will include some unique musical forms of live audience participation, we will experience some of the patterns that connect two of the most human of activities: creating code, and creating music."
