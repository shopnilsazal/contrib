In this BOF session, Sven Mawson will demonstrate how Istio lets you control your services no matter where they run or what language they are written in. Whether you run in a container or stand-alone, whether you run in the cloud or on-premise, Istio can help you connect, manage, and secure your services.\n\nAbout Sven Mawson\nSven is a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google, and one of the founders of the open source Istio project. He joined Google in 2006, and has spent the past 10 years working on several generations of Google's API Management platform, starting with the AtomPub-based Google Data APIs. Prior to joining Google, Sven worked for Salesforce.com, where he helped design and build the SOQL language for querying hosted object databases. Sven received his BS in Computer Science from Stanford University and his PhD in Computer Science from UCLA. He currently resides in a redwood forest in the Santa Cruz mountains, east of Half Moon Bay, and enjoys spending time with his wife and three children hiking through the woods and counting banana slugs."
