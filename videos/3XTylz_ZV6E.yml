description: "Natural Language Processing challenges in the context of Polish and other Slavic languages\nŁukasz Kobyliński, Michał Wasiluk\n\nDescription\nNatural Language Processing is evolving quickly and the Deep Learning revolution has allowed us to create systems rivaling humans. Unfortunately, most of the research is focusing on the English language and the optimistic results that are the most discussed are not directly transferable to other languages. This talk presents some of the most common challenges in processing Slavic languages.\n\nAbstract\nDuring the talk we will discuss the most common challenges you are bound to face while working on NLP-related tasks and non-English languages. As an example, we will discuss the problem of Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging, which is relatively simple in English, but poses a significant difficulty in Polish. For English the problem is proclaimed as solved, by reaching the tagging error rates similar or lower than the human inter-annotator agreement, which is ca. 97%. In the case of languages with rich morphology, such as Polish, there is however no doubt that the accuracies of around 91% delivered by taggers leave much to be desired.\n\nWe will also discuss the Deep Learning approaches as applied to Slavic-languages NLP and the problems faced when using vector-based representations, such as word2vec and fasttext. Typical challenges and comparisons will be made on the example of POS tagging and event detection.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
