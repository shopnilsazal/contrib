description: "\"I’m a cross between a night dragon, code wizard and a unique damn butterfly. I am not your ‘resource’ to pimp out!” said every rage-quit prone engineer, ever. As a team leader, the line between diverse culture and a dogmatic cult is thin. Embracing individuality, yet finding alignment as a collective, is tough. Understanding what defines one over another is critical so everyone can bring 100% of themselves to table.\n\nIn this talk I’m going to walk through our journey as a team: finding alignment, embracing individuality and discovering our shared values. I’ll identify our faulty pitfalls, red-flags and a set of questions to ask yourself everyday to make sure that what you have a is “Culture of Talent” and not a “Cult of Conformity.\"\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HLzZ/"
