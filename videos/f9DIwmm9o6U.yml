description: "William Louth, architect of JXInsight over at JINSPIRED, will be giving a talk on JVM performance measurement, optimization and execution control. During the talk he will outline a vision for the future of software performance measurement & execution analysis as well as reliability/resilience engineering touching on such topics as self awareness (behavioral introspection), self regulation (control & feedback, systems & signals) as well as approaches to performance analysis in highly parallel/distributed execution environments.\n\nJ'ai créé cette vidéo à l'aide de l'application de montage de vidéos YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/editor)."
