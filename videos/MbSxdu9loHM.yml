description: "Designing an elegant interface for developers to communicate with your Android app is crucial for building a mobile platform. Ty has been building mobile-focused developer platforms at Evernote, Twitter, and now Uber. In this talk, he’ll walk you through many of the best practices that he has accumulated and you’ll find out how to allow third party developers to seamlessly interact with your users’ local data to shortcut more expensive server operations.\n\nTopics will include building single sign-on, surfacing your local databases, constructing well-defined Intent interfaces, using deep links, and binding services for programmatic communication. Ty will walk you through how to create a well-defined interface in your app – if that’s something you want to know, don’t miss it!"
