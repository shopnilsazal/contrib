recordingDate: 1438096652
description: "Maintaining consistency within a growing project is a challenge. I have struggled with my companyâ€™s Go web API as it has grown over the past two years, trying to find a nice solution to this intra-project consistency problem without resorting to a large-scale framework.\n\nIn my mind, there are three general layers to project consistency:\n\nconsistency in implementation among similar bits of code\nconsistency in black-box behavior among similar endpoints or commands\nconsistency between actual behavior and documented behavior (documentation accuracy)\nThis talk will outline how I have leveraged small-scale code and documentation generator tools for each of the three layers outlined above, specifically for the sake of consistency in a growing Go application without using a large-scale framework."
