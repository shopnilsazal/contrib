description: "What happens to Ruby when Rails dies?\n\nRuby rode the Rails rocketship to worldwide renown. While a handful of us were writing Ruby code before Rails came along, most of us owe Rails a debt of gratitude for taking Ruby mainstream, allowing us to make a living writing code in a language we love.\n\nBut opinions codified in Rails are falling out of favor.

Has Ruby entered its twilight years?\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Fovb/"
