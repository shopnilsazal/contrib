description: "DescriptionHacking with Human Interface Devices\nNikhil Mittal \n\nThis talk discusses using a Human Interface Device (HID) for penetration testing. We will see how a cheap and tiny device could be effectively used against a fairly secure and locked down network. We will also see how using it can be integrated in various phases of a penetration test. \n\nTechniques like in-memory code execution, reverse shells, system secrets in cleartext, backdooring, dropping weaponized files and more would be demonstrated. Only the device and built-in operating system tools will be used. \n\nThe talk will be full of live demonstrations. The lockpick one was not one of mine. I am searching for the Matt DuHarte one and the soldering one."
