description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nSRv6LB: Leveraging IPv6, Segment Routing, and VPP for Very Fast, Reliable, and Efficient Distributed Data Center Workload Balancing - Mark Townsley & Pierre Pfister, Cisco (Advanced Skill Level)\n\nIn this talk, we present performance and scalability numbers from our open source implementation of the Maglev data-plane (part of Google&rsquo;s load balancing architecture as defined in [1]) in fd.io/VPP, as well as extensions that leverage IPv6 and Segment Routing (SRv6LB [2]) in ways that improve the fairness and reliability for workload balancing in a Data Center. In systems like Kubernetes that serve a large number of connections to micro-service instances in containers, our analytical and experimental results show that processing with SRv6LB is more fairly balanced than with Maglev alone. This results in significantly faster overall response times for end users and more efficient utilization of compute resources, especially under very high load.\n\nAbout Mark\nMark Townsley is a Cisco Fellow, Ecole Polytechnique Professor, and co-Founder of the Paris Innovation and Research Laboratory (PIRL). Before Joining Cisco in 1997, he held positions at IBM, the Institute for Systems Research (ISR) and the Center for Satellite and Hybrid Communications Networks (CSHCN) at the University of Maryland. Mark served as IETF Internet Area Director from 2005-2009, IETF L2TP Working Group Chair from 1999-2005, IESG Liaison to the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and IETF Pseudowire WG Technical Advisor. Mark was the lead developer of the original implementation of L2TP in Cisco IOS as well as lead author of IETF L2TP protocol specification (RFC 2661). One of the original architects of the World IPv6 Day and Launch, Mark contributed significantly to the deployment of IPv6 on the internet, including lead author of RFC 5969, IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6RD). In 2011, Mark co-founded the IETF Homenet Working Group, and served as chair until 2017. In addition to his Faculty appointment at Ecole Polytechnique, Mark lectures on Future Internet Architectures at Telecom Paris Tech (TPT), and serves on the steering committee for the joint TPT-Polytechinque Advanced Computer Networking master’s degree. Mark holds a Bachelor of Science (summa cum laude) degree in Electrical Engineering from Auburn University and a Master’s degree in Computer Science (magna cum laude) from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. When not traveling, he lives with his family in Paris, France.\n\nAbout Pierre\nPierre Pfister is Software Engineer at Cisco's CTAO organization. He is an active participant and author at IETF (homenet, 6man, bier and hackathons) and co-developed the reference implementation of HNCP on OpenWrt platforms: hnetd. He is now commiter to FD.io's VPP-Sandbox project and active contributor to the VPP project where he co-developed MAP, ILA, vhost-user and MagLev. He graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique in 2012 and now mentors students on various projects."
