description: "John Sutherland - Iteration, iteration, iteration\n[EuroPython 2016]\n[22 July 2016]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/iteration-iteration-iteration)\n\nThere should be something for everyone in this whistle–stop tour of\niteration in Python setting off from `for`–loops, and riding\ncross–country to multiplexing coroutines!\n\nSee and hear the amazing sights and sounds of list comprehensions, and\ngenerators. Take in the amazing vistas from `itertools`, and be amazed\nat the magnificent `yield`!\n\n-----\n\nWe’ll take detours to higher–order functions, closures, and\ndecorators. And cover the FP inspired builtins `map`, `filter`, and\n`reduce`, as well as the epitome of Pythonic programming, `enumerate`."
