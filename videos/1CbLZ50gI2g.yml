recordingDate: 1408394835
description: "By, Dan Hon\nMoore’s law has meant that computing and communications power has been getting cheaper, smaller and faster. Soon, everything really will have an IP address. And yet.\n\nDesigning an internet of things that’s for humans means understanding when we might be creating an empathy gap. That gap doesn’t just apply to Silicon Valley releasing new technology into the world. This gap is experienced everywhere from when an airline’s customer service can frequently feel indifferent to the needs of those on a long journey; to government, when legislative policy reaches implementation.\n\nThis session is the story of how, in a more connected world, we should remember to design those things, products and services to understand us.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGYK/"
