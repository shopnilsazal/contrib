description: "Rails is the right choice for building a user facing web site, but Ruby, as a flexible language, has also proven to be a good choice to develop various services. At Airbnb, we have split up our monorail application into multiple internal services, mostly on MRI with a select few services on JRuby. A service-oriented approach combined with JRuby has afforded us high performance and access to Java libraries for complex operations. From the perspective of a former MRI'er, I'll discuss concrete examples of how to realize the benefits of the JRuby stack as well as the complexity of managing various Rubies in production.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG7K/"
