title: '#HITBGSEC 2016 SG Conference Track D2 - iOS 10 Kernel Heap Revisited - Stefan Esser'
recordingDate: 1475536284
description: "The iOS Kernel Heap has been under constant development since its implementation was first discussed around the time of iOS 4 and 5. Since then several details of the implementation have changed and it has been hardened by Apple against heap exploitation attacks. Yet recent talks about iOS kernel exploitation have completely ignored these changes and presented the heap as if it had not changed at all. This talk will close this gap and give an detailed look at the current state of iOS kernel heap exploitation.\n\nWithin this session we will have a look at the current iOS kernel heap implementation as it is used in iOS 9 and iOS 10 beta versions and discuss what Apple has done to counter heap exploitation techniques used in the wild and how attackers can adapt. Furthermore we will briefly discuss the results of our research into new iOS 10 kernel exploitation mitigations that might already be visible in the betas.\n\n===\n\nStefan Esser is best known in the security community as the PHP security guy. Since he became a PHP core developer in 2002 he devoted a lot of time to PHP and PHP application vulnerability research. However in his early days he released lots of advisories about vulnerabilities in software like CVS, Samba, OpenBSD or Internet Explorer. In 2003 he was the first to boot Linux directly from the hard disk of an unmodified XBOX through a buffer overflow in the XBOX font loader. In 2004 he founded the Hardened-PHP Project to develop a more secure version of PHP, known as Hardened-PHP, which evolved into the Suhosin PHP Security System in 2006. Since 2007 he works as head of research and development for the German security company SektionEins GmbH that he co-founded. In 2010 he did his own ASLR implementation for Apple’s iOS and shifted his focus to the security of the iOS kernel and iPhones in general. Since then he has spoken about the topic of iOS security at various information security conferences around the globe. In 2012 he co-authored the book the iOS Hackers Handbook.\n\n===\n\nStefan Esser is best known in the security community as the PHP security guy.
