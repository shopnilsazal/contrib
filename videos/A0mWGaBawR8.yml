description: "Let's Build Kubernetes, With a Spreadsheet and Volunteers! - Justin Garrison, Independent\n\nAn introduction to the core responsibilities of Kubernetes. A visual representation of how Kubernetes works and what each component does. Building from nothing until we have a fully functional Kubernetes cluster built from people.\n\nOur Kubernetes in meat space will teach you where to look when things break and help you remember what every component does. We'll show you how the system behaves when components fail and what you can do to fix it.\n\nAbout Justin Garrison\nJustin is the co-author of Cloud Native Infrastructure and has his name in multiple movie credits. What he enjoys most is helping people and learning new things. He likes to teach with unconventional approaches and being part of community."
