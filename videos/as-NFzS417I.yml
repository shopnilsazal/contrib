description: "From AppSecEU 2014 in Cambridge\nhttps://2014.appsec.eu/\n\nMany, many conferences nowadays come with \"HTML5 is insecure\" or \"Hacking with HTML5\" talks. This has lead to a general perception that HTML5 itself (whatever the term actually stands for) is insecure and, thus, should be avoided for security reasons. This is highly unfortunate, as the current generation of new Web APIs expose a level of security sophistication, which is unparalleled in the Web's history. In fact, new browser features such as CORS or PostMessage allow, for the first time, to securely realize usecases which, up to now, required the programmers to resort to insecure programming practices. \n\nIn this talk, we will systematically explore security relevant HTML5 APIs. To do so, we discuss their respective security architecture and, more importantly, show how they compare to currently established techniques which were designed to realize similar use cases. \n\nPlainly speaking you can consider this talk as a \"information security deathmatch - HTML5 vs. its alternative\" (spoiler: HTML5 wins). \n\nMore specifically, the talk will cover: \n\n# Client-side cross-domain communication: \n\n- CORS (HTML5) vs. JSONP and/or crossdomain.xml \n\n# Client-side persistence \n\n- LocalStorage (HTML5) vs. Cookie-hacks \n\n# In-browser communication \n\n- PostMessage (HTML5) vs. \n-- hash-identifier passing and/or \n-- window.name setting and/or \n-- domain relaxation \n\n# ClickJacking protection \n\n- X-Frames-Options (HTML5) vs. JavaScript framebusters \n\n# Bonus track: The browser's new security capabilities \n\nA quick overview of new browser features that can be used to secure Web sites: \n\n- Content Security Policies \n- Sandboxed iFrames \n- Strict-transport Security \n\nThe session's content is based on the experiences and lessons learned of a international academic research project on modern Web security (WebSand, http://websand.eu) of which the speaker is the technical lead. All given details will be backed with empirical data (when applicable). Furthermore, all discussed technologies can be accompanied with proof-of-concept code or practical demonstrations (if time permits). \n\n\nSpeakers\n\nMartin Johns\nDr. Martin Johns is a Senior Researcher in the Security and Trust group within SAP Research, where he leads the Web application security team. Currently, he is coordinator and scientific lead of the EU FP7 Project WebSand. Before joining SAP, Martin studied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Universities of Hamburg, Santa Cruz (CA), and Passau. During the 1990s and the early years of the new millennium he earned his living as a software engineer in... \nRead More â†’\n\nSebastian Lekies\nSebastian Lekies is a PhD candidate at SAP and the University of Bochum. His main field of research is Web application security.  Thereby, he mainly focuses on client-side Web attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting, ClickJacking, DNS-Rebinding, Cross-Site Request Forgery, etc.  He regularly publishes his work at academic and non-academic security conferences such as CCS, Usenix Security, Blackhat, OWASP Appsec, Deepsec, etc.\n\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
