title: 'PyCon UK 2016: Cleaner unit testing with the Arrange Act Assert pattern'
language: English
recordingDate: 1477388261
description: "James Cooke\n\nMy name is James and I've been using the Arrange Act Assert pattern as part of my daily Test Driven Development practice for a number of years over multiple projects with different development teams. During this time I've worked to make my tests as readable, simple and generally Pythonic as possible - and I firmly believe that the AAA pattern can help us all with this quest.\n\nIn this talk I shall:\n\nDemonstrate the AAA pattern of testing and its benefits.\nDiscuss the code smells can arise when using AAA.\nPresent some Pythonic (hopefully), object orientated and organised strategies for resolving these smells, refactoring for cleaner, more readable and reliable tests.\nPrerequisites: You should be familiar with the \"Red, Green, Refactor\" style of Test Driven Development."
