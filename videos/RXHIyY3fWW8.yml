description: "Robert Clark: Legal Aspects of Internet & Computer Network Defense\n\nAbstract: This presentation looks at several scenarios of aggressive self defense. It applies the law to each of the participants in various schemes to the aggressor and to the defender. We see where simple self defense options could actually result in prosecution to the aggressor; prosecution of the defender; prosecution of both; or, be faulted for screwing up an investigation rendering a prosecution impossible. Many of the legal rationales for aggressive self defense will be discussed from the typical discussion of self defense to the law of nuisance and self help. This presentation seeks to simplify the aspects of aggressive and non-aggressive self defense. \n\nBio: Major Robert Clark is the Command Judge Advocate for the Army? 1st Information Operations Command.
