description: "Maximillian Dornseif, Far More Than You Ever Wanted To Tell - Hidden Data In Document Formats\nApplications usually put all kinds of information besides the ones which you intend to into saved documents. This can lead to embarrassing revelations. We will take a look into different types of application data and what can be hidden in there. This allows us to 'scrub\" our own documents to avoid unwanted information in there but also to look for information in documents which the authors didn\"t want to hand out. Go grasp the scope of the problem we will present a large scale study of hidden information in Documents on the Internet.\n\nMaximillian Dornseif has studied laws and computer science at the University of Bonn, Germany where he wrote his PhD Thesis about the \"Phenomenology of Cybercrime\". He has been doing security consulting since the mid nineties. His clients included the industry but also government. At the moment he works on a third party founded research project about measurement of security and security breaches taking place at the Laboratory for Dependable Distributed Systems, RWTH Aachen University. He also oversees several other projects in the area of detection and documentation of security incidents. Dornseif has published in the legal and computer science fields on a wide range of topics."
