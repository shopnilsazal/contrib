title: 'Kod.io 2014 - Spaxels - Ars Electronica Quadcopter Swarm by Chris Bruckmayr'
recordingDate: 1396627004
description: "The Spaxels, the 3d-Pixels that the Ars Electronica Futurelab has created based on quadcopter-technology, have proven their skills to paint logos and animations into the sky a number of times.\nThe idea is both simpel and powerful: In order to create more complex 3d-forms than you usually could with the limited amount of Spaxels, you use a so-called Real Time Lightning Paint Video System.\n\nThe human eye can only perceive lightsources, but can't really track their light-trail, something that cameras can do.\n\nThey are set up for long-exposure-shots and through this, you can create complex 3d-models out of nowhere, using the Spaxels, cameras and screens.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG32/"
