We will also bring forth afew tips and guidelines to configure and manage it in the most optimal way.These may help you to set it up efficiently and meet your infrastructurerequirements. At the end of the session you will have learned how to make themost out of the Group Replication plug-in in terms of HA while achieving goodperformance overall.\n\n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 16:05:00"
