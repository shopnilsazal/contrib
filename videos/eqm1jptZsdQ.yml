description: "by Dag Wieers\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe aim of this project is to collect air quality information (fine dustparticles) by means of a device that collects fine dust (PM1.0 and PM2.5)metrics. The device is mounted on bicycles to crowdsource factual airpollution information in and around the city of Ghent, Belgium and centralizethat information for further processing.\n\nDuring this presentation we will look at the hardware and firmware design. Newideas and future extensions. But we also touch on the problems related toparticulate matter and air pollution.\n\nThe device uses an ESP8266 with various sensors and output devices. Thefirmware is written in C++ using the Arduino framework.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 11:00:00"
