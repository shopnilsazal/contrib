description: "Twilio's distributed architecture makes manually tracking down a communication bottleneck or failure almost impossible. By utilizing a distributed tracing system, Twilio can follow any request through each service layer and each host. In this talk, we will demonstrate how a Rails application can gain the same insights by instrumenting a multi-tier application and investigate tracing integration into a larger distributed ecosystem.\n\nKenny Hoxworth is a software engineer at Twilio dedicated to the reliable delivery of messaging communication. He previously co-founded a cyber-security company in Baltimore, Maryland, where he helped design and build the company's Rails flagship application and backend technology stack.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0b/"
