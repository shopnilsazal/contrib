description: "Leadership starts with Listening: Amplify your Impact by Heidi Helfand\n\nListening is power. By “tuning in” and applying self management and directed curiosity you can help others thrive and solve their own problems. Doing this not only leads to greater ownership, but also more leaders in your organization instead of “order takers”. In this interactive talk I’ll teach you practical communication skills so you can become a more available and empowering coworker, friend and leader."
