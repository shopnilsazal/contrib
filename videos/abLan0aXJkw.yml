recordingDate: 1373486640
description: "From LISA '12\nBrendan Gregg, Joyent\nPerformance analysis methodologies provide guidance, save time, and can find issues that are otherwise overlooked. Example issues include hardware bus saturation, lock contention, recoverable device errors, kernel scheduling issues, and unnecessary workloads. The talk will focus on the USE Method: a simple strategy for all staff for performing a complete check of system performance health, identifying common bottlenecks and errors. Other analysis methods discussed include workload characterization, drill-down analysis, and latency analysis, with example applications from enterprise and cloud computing. Don't just reach for toolsâ€”use a method!"
