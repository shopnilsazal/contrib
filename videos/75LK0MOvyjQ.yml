description: "Internships: Good for the Intern, Great for the Team by Lillie Chilen\n\nYou might think that hiring interns is charity work. Your company is bringing on less-than-baked engineers and spending precious engineering resources to train them and bring them up to speed on your technologies.\n\nSurprise! Interns actually help your team, too. Running a successful internship program helps your team level up its teaching skills, discourages silos, and encourages writing maintainable code. I’ll talk about mistakes, successes, and specific processes to keep your team and interns productive, and you’ll leave this talk with plenty of fodder for hiring interns at your company.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/J48T/"
