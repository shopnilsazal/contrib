description: "By: Arlo Belshee\n\nMock objects are a good way to break apart a legacy system to test it. However, they do not improve coupling (few dependencies between units) or cohesion (each unit does one thing). Making code easy to change requires using indirections with looser coupling. In this information-dense, code-oriented session, weâ€™ll learn key indirections and their impacts on your design. Next time, choose the right indirection for the job rather than just reaching for another mock object."
