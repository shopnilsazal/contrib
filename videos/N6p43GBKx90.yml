recordingDate: 1392967996
description: "Rich Bodo - It is Now Safe to Compile your Phone System\nThe telephony industry was late to adopt open-source software and commodity protocols. The open-source development community is rapidly correcting that problem. Everyone from enthusiasts to Fortune 500 companies are now deploying open-source telephony software, from PBX's to voice messaging systems to VoIP gateways. This lecture will focus on the practical. We'll provide demos of the major open-source telephony systems, a brief tutorial on rapid application development, and a discussion of the effect these systems will have on the future the industry. Special attention will be paid to Bayonne and other GNU projects, and their relationship to the more ambitious GNUComm and GNU Enterprise meta-projects.\n\nAttendees should leave with an understanding of the general capabilities of the major existing open-source telephony projects and a working knowledge of basic application development with the GNU telephony subsytem.\n\nRich is a regular contributor to the Bayonne project, and the coordinator of the GNUComm and Voxilla projects. He worked as a software engineer at several silicon valley telephony companies, and one Linux company, before founding Open Source Telecom Corporation (OST). OST has been deploying open-source telephony systems since 1999. He has most recently spoken at the O'reilly Open Source Convention and the Intel Communications Tech Summit. He organizes the bi-annual Free Telephony Summit as well as the Telephony BOFs and GNUComm booths at LinuxWorld conventions."
