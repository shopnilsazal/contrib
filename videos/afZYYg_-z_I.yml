description: "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nIn this talk Elena will describe challenges that arise when building machine learning models that should run in production to personalize user's search. She will present biases that can be hidden in your observational data and can destroy your model completely and will explain several options on how you can correct for them.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQ7WiZwdzse-V9D_uZgdLLrPhe-BZeIEE71_qtR_my4/edit?usp=sharing \n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
