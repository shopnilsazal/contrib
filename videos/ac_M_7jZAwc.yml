title: 'MountainWest RubyConf 2013 You Should Be On Call, too by Joshua Timberman'
recordingDate: 1367074263
description: "One of the reasons for the DevOps movement is that all developers should carry pagers and be on call, right?\nWell, not quite. However, there is a common area of conflict between operations and development teams about site outages related to application-related issues that developers know how to debug and fix much faster than operations typically does.\nIn this talk, I'll discuss some companies that have successfully implemented developers on call\" policies and what that means. I'll also discuss the business value, why it matters, and how it helps create a collaborative culture of sharing.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGbm/"
