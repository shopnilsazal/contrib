Addressing these problems is a Herculean task but the alternative is a system susceptible to total ownage at the worst possible time.\n\nChristian “quaddi” Dameff and Jeff “r3plicant” Tully are recently graduated physicians, researchers, and DEF CON regulars with a passion for the intersection between security and healthcare. With a shared background in resuscitation and emergency medical services research, and the evolving use of technology in the practice and delivery of care, quaddi and r3plicant have positioned themselves at the forefront of a new group of practitioners savvy in the myriad of ways that security (or lack thereof) is beginning to shape the medicine of the future.\n\nTwitter: @CDameffMD @jefftullymd\n\nPeter Hefley is an information security consultant with experience in the retail, payment processing, financial, energy, defense, and healthcare industries. Enraged by constant reports that his PHI has been lost by Tricare and recognizing opportunities for improvement in healthcare, he seeks to improve the field by facilitating partnerships between security folk and clinicians.\n\nTwitter: @PeterHefley"
