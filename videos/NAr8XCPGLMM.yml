description: "Paul Hallett - What it's really like building RESTful APIs with Django\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nAt the beginning of this year I started working at Lyst and I was\ntasked with helping to replace their old and outdated web API with a\nmodern RESTful replacement.\n \nAlong the way we encountered some interesting design decisions and now\nIâ€™m going to share what we learned about building a real RESTful API\nwith Django and Django REST framework.\n\nI've been talking about how to build great RESTful APIs for the past\nyear at various Python and Django conferences in Europe. Now I'd like\nto take some real world experiences from creating Lyst's new web API\nand share what I've learned along the way."
