description: "Not many people are designing video games for MS-DOS these days, but that didn't stop Vblank Entertainment's Brian Provinciano from taking on the task. Inthis 2016 talk, hear Provinciano explain how he reduced memory usage down to 4MB, increased performance to run on a 486 PC, reduced disk space to fit on a single 1.44MB floppy, and finally ported the game to MS-DOS itself.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
