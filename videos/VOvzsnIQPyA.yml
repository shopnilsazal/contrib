Aaron evangelizes application security by leading open source projects, participating in standard organizations and giving talks at conferences. \n\nABSTRACT:\nThe notion of \"secure by design” or \"privacy by design” for IoT devices has been a perspective for standard organizations. Legislative entities from both the US and EU recognize the impact these \"things\" can effect lives and the enterprise. To better understand a secure design, we will explore the supply chain and development lifecycle of these IoT devices and discuss how our roles as security professionals and researchers. \n\nREASON:\nFrom a manufacturing perspective, I see things a little differently than most. I would like to enlighten others on the real SDLC processes that happen in house and external."
