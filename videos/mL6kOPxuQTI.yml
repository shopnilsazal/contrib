description: "Developer Productivity Engineering by  Panayiotis Thomakos\n\nRuby is often praised for being a happy language. For highly motivated developers, a large part of happiness is tied to being productive. How can we extend the productivity gains we experience from writing Ruby to an entire engineering organization? At Strava we are experimenting with a framework we call Developer Productivity Engineering (DPE). DPE applies the principles of Site Reliability Engineering, developed by Google, to improving productivity through automation for both individual engineers and engineering organizations. This talk is a detailed view of the DPE framework and our experience with it so far."
