description: "View slides for presentation here:\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/PyData/mike-pittaro-high-performance-hardware-for-data-analysis\n\nPyData NYC 2014\nChoosing hardware for big data analysis is difficult because of the many options and variables involved. The problem is more complicated when you need a full cluster for big data analytics.\n\nThis session will cover the basic guidelines and architectural choices involved in choosing analytics hardware for Spark and Hadoop. I will cover processor core and memory ratios, disk subsystems, and network architecture. This is a practical advice oriented session, and will focus on performance and cost tradeoffs for many different options."
