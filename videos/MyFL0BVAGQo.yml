description: "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nIs it possible to apply data science to a creative task? In my talk, I will cover my research to the (semi-)automated creation of advertisement product compositions. The resulting application co-creates compositions with graphic designers by making use of an evolutionary algorithm with user input. The algorithm is built in DEAP and runs on AWS.\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
