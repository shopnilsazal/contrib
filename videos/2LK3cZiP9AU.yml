recordingDate: 1424300669
description: "By, Andy Maleh\nWhile web development is thriving in the Ruby world with Rails, Sinatra, and other frameworks, desktop development is still not very common as a lot of developers rely on Java technologies like Eclipse or straight .NET technologies such as Windows Forms. This talk will walk attendees through some Ruby desktop development frameworks/libraries, contrasting the pros and cons of each, and mentioning what is missing that discourages developers from relying on Ruby to build desktop applications. Frameworks/libraries covered will include MacRuby, Shoes, Limelight, and Glimmer.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GJEx/"
