title: 'AppSec EU 2017 Printer Security by Jens MÃ¼ller and Vladislav Mladenov'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495760059
description: "From a security point of view, printers have been overseen for a long time. Even though these devices have direct access to sensitive information like confidential reports, contracts, or patient recipes, there is no research summarizing attacks on printers. More importantly, there is no general methodology on printer security evaluation, and no pentesting tools are available.\nIn our research, we provide the first comprehensive study regarding the security of printers. We evaluate 20 different printers revealing serious security flaws on all of them. We categorize the attacks in four different classes: Denial-of-Service (DoS), Protection Bypass, Print Job Manipulation, and Information Disclosure. Our evaluation was supported by a novel open source pentesting tool called PRET.\nWe extend our analysis on systems beyond printers and evaluate Google Cloud Print and other PostScript processing websites. The result reveals information leakages and further security issues.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
