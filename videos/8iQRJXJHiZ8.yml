description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nKeynote: Accelerating Kubernetes Native Applications - Brandon Philips, CTO of CoreOS, Red Hat\n\nCoreOS introduced the Operator concept to the Kubernetes community in 2016: a tool that automates the operational tasks necessary to deploy, update, and run a distributed application on Kubernetes. Operators reduce the barriers to entry to develop applications on Kubernetes - but building an Operator from scratch is a time-consuming task that requires a deep understanding of Kubernetes. Join Brandon Philips for a look at whatâ€™s new to help accelerate your ability to build your own Operator and get back to developing your innovative application.\n\nAbout Brandon\nBrandon Philips is helping to shape the future of modern Linux server infrastructure at Red Hat. Brandon joined Red Hat as member of technical staff following the acquisition of CoreOS where he served as CTO. Prior to CoreOS, he worked at Rackspace hacking on cloud monitoring and was a Linux kernel developer at SUSE. As a graduate of Oregon State's Open Source Lab he is passionate about open source technologies."
