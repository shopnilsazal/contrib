title: 'CNCF Webinar - Cloud Native Applications from Development to Production'
recordingDate: 1510873079
description: "Cloud-native applications—that is, applications that have been developed specifically for cloud platforms—are the future of software development. Container packaged, dynamically managed, and micro service-oriented, cloud-native systems give developers greater flexibility and empower them with the speed and velocity needed to deploy efficiently. How can you transition to this new, cloud-computing paradigm to meet the vision of cloud-native? \n\nIn this webinar, we will cover some of the advantages and elements of a cloud-native approach, and how GitLab is making it simpler to deploy cloud-native applications to production using Kubernetes."
