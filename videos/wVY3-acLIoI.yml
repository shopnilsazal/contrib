description: "How do 3G and 4G connection speeds differ across countries? What is the effect of 301 redirect on user experience, and thus on conversion rate? These are some of the questions connecting web performance to UX and business metrics that we will be looking at in this talk.\n\nHTTP archive, although very useful, consists of data points that constitute what is known as synthetic measurement, since these numbers are obtained from pages loaded from a browser in a datacenter and not from actual users. That changes with the Chrome User Experience Report that Google launched last October. This Real User Monitoring (RUM) data for Google Chrome users include key user experience metrics for 10,000 websites from real users.\n\nWe will analyse this data to answer these questions, our experience in digging through this dataset and potential pitfalls to avoid when analysing it."
