description: 'When it comes to functional programming techniques seeing widespread adoption in the JavaScript community, immutability is a strong contender for "next in line". In this talk I''ll show you what immutability is all about, why it''s useful, and how to work with it. We''ll even put immutability to work in a React app and observe how we can reduce complexity while increasing performance.'
