description: 'Have you ever been surprised by sophisticated vocabulary used by some hip-hop artists? With standard data science tools, I search a large corpus of hip-hop lyrics in order to extract rhyming couplets that include uncommon and interesting words. Using curated output from this code, I demonstrate how to automate the creation of short text-based posts for a hip-hop themed "Word of the Day" blog.'
