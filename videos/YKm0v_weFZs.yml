description: "Rails allows us to write very concise code hiding a lot of the complexity. However, it's common to face situations that require us to write more complex code on our own, and sometimes we forget a little about what Rails can do for us. We are going through some Rails features that people might not be aware of, talking about Active Record queries, custom template handlers, routing niceties, view helpers and more, to learn how these tricks can help simplifying complex code on our apps.\n\nCarlos (@cantoniodasilva) hacks beautiful code at Plataformatec, a consultancy firm based in Brazil, and is member of the Rails Core Team. He enjoys writing about a variety of subjects at the company's blog, and helping maintaining open source projects like Simple Form and Devise.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1a/"
