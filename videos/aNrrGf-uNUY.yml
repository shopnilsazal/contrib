description: "holger krekel - packaging and testing with devpi and tox\n[EuroPython 2014]\n[24 July 2014]\n\nThis talk discusses good ways to organise packaging and testing\nfor Python projects.  It walks through a per-company and an\nopen source scenario and explains how to best use the\n\"devpi-server\" and \"tox\" for making sure you are delivering\ngood and well tested and documented packages.  As time permits, we also\ndiscuss in-development features such as real-time mirroring and\nsearch.\n\n-----\n\nThe talk discusses the following tools:\n\n- devpi-server for running an in-house or per-laptop python package server\n\n- inheritance between package indexes and from pypi.python.org public packages\n\n- the \"devpi\" client tool for uploading docs and running tests \n\n- running of tests through tox \n\n- summary view with two work flows: open source releases and in-house per-company developments \n\n- roadmap and in-development features of devpi and tox \n\n(The presenter is the main author of the tools in question)."
