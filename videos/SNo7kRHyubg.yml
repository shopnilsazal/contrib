title: 'Scripting the Internet of Things'

description: "Damien George\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/202/view_talk\nA big part of the Internet of Things are the end nodes, such as sensors, that    \r\nare controlled by microcontrollers or other small computing devices. These    \r\ndevices are getting more and more sophisticated and it can be beneficial to    \r\nprogram them with a scripting language instead of a low-level language like C.    \r\nSuch scripting languages need to be implemented specifically to fit and run on    \r\na microcontroller and in this talk I will discuss a few of them: Python, Lua,    \r\nJavaScript and Ruby. I will talk in detail about MicroPython, a lean and    \r\nefficient reimplementation of Python 3 with a reduced standard library, that    \r\nruns on microcontrollers and can be used to build Internet-of-Things devices.    \r\nThere will be plenty of time in the talk for questions and open discussion."
