description: "Let's Run Cloud Foundry on Kubernetes - Vlad Iovanov & Nikhil Manchanda, HPE\n\n\"Cloud Foundry is an Open Source – Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution that has been widely adopted across industry segments to provide Cloud Native Application development constructs for deploying and scaling applications without locking to a particular cloud platform. The Cloud Foundry runtime supports both Buildpack and Docker based applications. The standard deployment and life-cycle management of Cloud Foundry roles is done via the open source project BOSH. BOSH manages resources at a VM level.\n \nIn this talk, the speakers will demonstrate how Fissile (a project open sourced by HPE) containerized Cloud Foundry and leveraged Kubernetes as the life-cycle management of its roles. As BOSH releases are precisely structured, we are able to craft Docker images that contain jobs and packages, similar to what you get after BOSH provisions you a VM.\n \nHPE's containerized Cloud Foundry offering is built upon a Control Plane that abstracts and automates deployment of cloud-native services across multiple IaaS environments: OpenStack, VMware vSphere®, and Amazon Web Services.\n \nThe Control Plane leverages Kubernetes as its container management platform. HCP takes care of a lot of the details of running Kubernetes across multiple IaaS providers. HCP manages all components required for Kubernetes to operate – from load balancing endpoints to networks to compute and storage.\"\n\nAbout Vlad Iovanov\nVlad Iovanov is currently working as a Technical Lead on the Helion Cloud Foundry project at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. He has given various talks in industry for topics ranging from Container technologies, Windows framework and Best practices for Application Development. Located in Seattle, USA\n\nAbout Nikhil Manchanda\nNikhil is a Master Engineer working at HP Enterprise on Stackato v4.0 -- a PaaS solution based on Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry.His main areas of expertise lie in databases, identity, and distributed systems but he has also been known to occasionally dabble in machine learning, mobile applications, and software update intelligence.In a previous life, he was the Project Technical Lead for OpenStack Trove -- the OpenStack Database Service.In his spare time you can often find him hunched over his desk either assiduously hacking away on his Raspberry Pi or NAS4Free box, or writing verse and short stories."
