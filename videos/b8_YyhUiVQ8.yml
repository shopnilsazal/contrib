title: 'GoGaRuCo 2013 - Ruby On Robots Using Artoo by Ron Evans'
recordingDate: 1381361271
description: "The robotics revolution has already begun. You can buy drones and robotic devices at local retail stores. Unfortunately, it's hard to develop code for robots, and nearly impossible to create solutions that integrate multiple different kind of devices. Introducing Artoo, a new robotics framework written in Ruby. Artoo can communicate with many different kinds of hardware devices, and integrate them together. With surprisingly few lines of code, you can write interesting applications that tie together Arduinos, ARDrones, Spheros, and more... even all at the same time! The time has come for Ruby-based robotics, and Artoo can help lead the way!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG7r/"
