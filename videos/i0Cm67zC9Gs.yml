language: English
recordingDate: 1495791982
description: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks are one of the critical threats for web applications. In this presentation, we focus on CSRF attacks that affects web sites&rsquo; authentication and identity management functionalities. We call them collectively as Authentication CSRF. If carried out successfully, Authentication CSRF attacks can cause sensitive information theft, account hijack, etc. We will present seven security testing strategies that can be used by a tester to manually detect vulnerabilities causing Authentication CSRF. We will also present CSRF-Checker, a proof-of-concept tool based on OWASP ZAP that helps in the semi-automatic detection of Authentication CSRF. Additionally, we will describe our experience of testing Alexa top 1500 web sites using our manual and semi-automatic Authentication CSRF testing strategies. The results are alarming, we discovered 191 vulnerable web sites spread across Alexa top 1500, including web sites from top vendors such as Microsoft, Google, etc.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
