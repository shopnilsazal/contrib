description: "Kerberos “Golden Tickets” were unveiled by Alva “Skip” Duckwall & Benjamin Delpy in 2014 during their Black Hat USA presentation. Around this time, Active Directory (AD) admins all over the world felt a great disturbance in the Force. Golden Tickets are the ultimate method for persistent, forever AD admin rights to a network since they are valid Kerberos tickets and can’t be detected, right?\n\nThis talk explores the latest Active Directory attack vectors and describes how Golden Ticket usage can be detected. When forged Kerberos tickets are used in AD, there are some interesting artifacts that can be identified. Yes, despite what you may have read on the internet, there are ways to detect Golden & Silver Ticket usage.\n\nSkip the fluff and dive right into the technical detail describing the latest methods for gaining and maintaining administrative access in Active Directory, including some sneaky AD persistence methods. Also covered are traditional security measures that work (and ones that don’t) as well as the mitigation strategies that disrupts the attacker’s preferred game-plan. Prepare to go beyond “Pass-the-Hash” and down the rabbit hole.\n\nSome of the topics covered:\n\nSneaky persistence methods attackers use to maintain admin rights.\nHow attackers go from zero to (Domain) Admin\nMS14-068: the vulnerability, the exploit, and the danger.\n“SPN Scanning” with PowerShell to identify potential targets without network scans (SQL, Exchange, FIM, web servers, etc.).\nExploiting weak service account passwords as a regular AD user.\nMimikatz, the attacker’s multi-tool.\nUsing Silver Tickets for stealthy persistence that won’t be detected (until now).\nIdentifying forged Kerberos tickets (Golden & Silver Tickets) on your network.\nDetecting offensive PowerShell tools like Invoke-Mimikatz.\nActive Directory attack mitigation.\nKerberos expertise is not required since the presentation covers how Active Directory leverages Kerberos for authentication identifying the areas useful for attack. Information presented is useful for both Red Team & Blue Team members.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nSean Metcalfe is the Chief Technology Officer at Dan Solutions, a company that provides Microsoft platform engineering and security expertise.
