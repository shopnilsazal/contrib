description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Pierre-Antoine LaFayette, Facebook.\n\nReference material: https://github.com/fbsamples/glTF-Renderer\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-12\n\nLearn how we brought another new media type to Facebook with interactive 3D posts. glTF is a new standard transmission format for 3D from the Khronos group. It has a ton of momentum behind it with lots of industry support. In this talk, we'll discuss why we chose glTF for our 3D format and cover the technical details of how we made it possible to share and view your VR art from Oculus Medium and Facebook Spaces in Facebook for Android.\n\n3D posts were brought to you by the Social VR and 360 Media teams at Facebook.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
