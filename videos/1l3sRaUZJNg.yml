title: 'Corrode Tool-aided translation from C to Rust'
language: English
recordingDate: 1520694258
description: "by Jamey Sharp\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nC has been the _de facto_ systems programming language for decades, so hugeamounts of useful programs and libraries are written in that language. NewRust code can make use of that legacy of work via FFI, but to get the fulladvantages of Rust, legacy software needs to be re-written in Rust. Corrode isa tool to semi-automate these rewrites by producing Rust source that behavesexactly like the original C, enabling developers to focus on the interestingparts of improving code quality. I'll talk about what Corrode does and doesnot do; present case studies of Corrode-assisted translations; and discussrationale for decisions such as writing Corrode in Haskell or documenting in\"literate programming\" style.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 13:00:00"
