description: "RailsConf 2017: Bebop to the Top - The Jazz Band As A Guide To Leadership by Michael Cain\n\nThe ideal workplace, with motivated employees, supportive managers and a clear vision in the \"C-suite\", is where we'd all like to work, isn't it? The question then, is, how do we create it? How do managers walk the fine line of \"micromanaging\" and \"anarchy\"? How can we, as employees, maximize our contribution to our company and love what we do at the same time?\n\nThe secret is in the big band.\n\nInspired by Max Dupree's Leadership Jazz, this talk will show you how to apply the principles of improvisation to your company/team and make your workplace more efficient, effective and fun!"
