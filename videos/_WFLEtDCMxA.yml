description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nTUF / Notary Deep Dive – David Lawrence, Docker & Justin Cappos, NYU, TUF (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nThis talk provides a deep technical dive into two CNCF projects that focus on secure software distribution, Notary and TUF.&nbsp; Specifically, the session will feature a deep-dive into Notary, showing technical advances added beyond the TUF spec that provide additional protections in the cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp;The session will also examine impending improvements to TUF that will increase its security and applicability to different domains.\n\nAbout Justin\nJustin Cappos is a professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at New York University. His research includes the TUF project (which is hosted by the Linux Foundation / CNCF), which provides a compromise-resilient mechanism for the secure distribution of software. His research advances are adopted into production use by Docker, git, Python, VMware, Cloudflare, Digital Ocean, most Linux distributions, and many automobiles. Due to the practical impact of his work, Cappos was named to Popular Science's Brilliant 10 list in 2013 recognizing him as one of 10 brilliant scientists under 40.\n\nAbout David\nLay security developer that has learned a lot of mistakes the hard way. David started off building authentication systems, moved on to encrypted cloud storage for a few years, and is now working on the Security Team at Docker, presently focused on securing software distribution"
