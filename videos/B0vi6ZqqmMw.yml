description: "DevOpsDays Boston 2017- Service Mesh: What, Why, And How? by Flynn\n\nCompanies adopting microservices are recognizing the importance of the service mesh: a transparent layer that adds application-level resilience, observability, and security to your infrastructure.

We’ll show a service mesh in action, using the open source Envoy, Istio, and Ambassador projects running on Kubernetes."
