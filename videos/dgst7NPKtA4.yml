title: 'AppSec EU 2017 An Introduction To Quantum Safe Cryptography by Liz O''Sullivan'
language: English

description: "Quantum computing has captured the imagination of researchers and quantum algorithms have been published that show, in principle, an exponential speed up in integer factorisation. As much of our modern day public key cryptography, such as RSA, ECC and DSA is based on the hardness of such problems, a machine that implements quantum factoring at scale threatens much of our current IT security.\n\nIn 2015 the US National Security Agency announced that their \"Suite B\" cryptographic algorithms used to protect federal systems is no longer fit for purpose and a competition to replace these with new quantum-safe algorithms is underway. This is a massive disruption to the data security marketplace.\n\nThe SAFEcrypto project: Secure Architectures of Future Emerging Cryptography is funded under the EU H2020 programme. SAFEcrypto will provide a new generation of practical, robust and physically secure post-quantum cryptographic solutions that ensure long-term security for future IT systems.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
