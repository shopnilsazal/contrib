title: 'DEF CON 17 - Chris Gates and Mario Ceballos - Breaking the Unbreakable Oracle with Metasploit'
recordingDate: 1384992160
description: "Breaking the \"Unbreakable\" Oracle with Metasploit\nChris Gates Member of the Metasploit Project\nMario Ceballos Developer for the Metasploit Project\n\nOver the years there have been tons of Oracle exploits, SQL Injection vulnerabilities, and post exploitation tricks and tools that had no order, methodology, or standardization, mainly just random .sql files. Additionally, none of the publicly available Pentest Frameworks have the ability to leverage built-in package SQL Injection vulnerabilities for privilege escalation, data extraction, or getting operating system access. In this presentation we are going to present an Oracle Pentesting Methodology and give you all the tools to break the \"unbreakable\" Oracle as Metasploit auxiliary modules. We've created your version and SID enumeration modules, account bruteforcing modules, ported all the public (and not so public) Oracle SQL Injection vulnerabilities into SQLI modules (with IDS evasion examples for 10g/11g), modules for OS interaction, and modules for automating some of our post exploitation tasks.\n\nChris Gates (CG), member of the Metasploit project, Penetration Tester (but everyone is these days), and regular security blogger (carnal0wnage.blogspot.com).\n\nMario Ceballos (MC) is a computer security analyst. He has a number of years of experience in vulnerability research and exploit development. He is an active contributor to the Metasploit Framework primarily focusing on the auxiliary and exploit modules.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
