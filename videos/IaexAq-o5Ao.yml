description: "Alexander Hendorf - Game Theory to the Rescue When Hard Decisions Are to Be Made\n[EuroPython 2016]\n[20 July 2016]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n(https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/game-theory-to-the-rescue-when-hard-decisions-are-to-be-made)\n\nSometimes it's hard to decide when a something is really done or\ncannot be improved further.\n**Game theory** can help you to make complicated decisions whenever\nyou encounter flow problems.\n\n-----\n\nGame theory is \"the study of mathematical models of conflict and\ncooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers.\"\n\nIn our use case we had to match data  for accounting:  -  the data was\nnot always clean but we had some extra tools at hand and a complex\nsystem to make good guesses. Nevertheless it was hard to decide when\nto give up, some records were just not processable.\nFinally we used Game theory to make the decision.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory"
