description: "DevOpsDays NYC 2016 - Blue Grass in a Brown Field: Building Awesome People and a Culture of Learning by Nivia Henry\n\nWouldn't we all want to work at an organization that values and rewards the contribution of knowledge workers? Wouldn't it be easier if our current organizations prioritized learning, experimentation, and collaboration as key success factors? Well...yes! But we must deal with the realities in front of us, not those wish to be. Even after ample research substantiating the benefits of organizations moving towards more autonomy, faster feedback and a culture of relentless learning, many orgs still hold on to the notion of power, while putting on a front of change and collaboration."
