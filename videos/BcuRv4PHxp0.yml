title: 'Faster & less risky releases with feature flags - Edith Harbaugh'
recordingDate: 1480405100
description: "Agile software teams want to move faster and deliver features to end users faster. However, pushing faster and more often usually means more risk of breaking and downtime. Feature flags, gating features and being able to quickly reverse them enables development teams to ship more frequently.\nWith feature flags, engineering changes are pushed live to production “off”, and then turned on to different users. Feature flags allow developers to separate deployment from rollout, enabling the ability to quickly throttle features for different users segments. In this talk, you'll learn how you can use feature flags for opt-in early access, private beta, canary launches and dark releases."
