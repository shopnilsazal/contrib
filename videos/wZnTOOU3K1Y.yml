description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #12\n25 February 2018\nSponsored and Hosted by Taboola\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nBooking.com is the largest travel e-commerce website in the world. To make user's search of the suitable property smooth, data scientists are working hard to predict user's needs by building advanced machine learning algorithms. Based on these models the website's content is adjusted to provide only the most relevant information to the user. Unfortunately, building such models is a complex task. There are a lot of challenges such as incomplete data, biased data and so on. In this talk Elena will describe these challenges in details and will explain how to deal with them in practice.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
