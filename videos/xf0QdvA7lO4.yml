description: "By, Grzegorz Witek\nThey're everywhere. They're on the leaf that falls from the tree straight on your head. They're on the building you pass everyday morning. They're on the socks you wear today and in the code you write. Patterns.\n\nDesign patterns are defined as general, reused solutions to recurring design problems. The term, coming from architecture, appeared in software development 20 years ago and since then has been one of the most controversial topics among programmers. Are software design patterns really general and can be reused in various programs? Or are they just solutions with limited scope and don't deserve all the buzz they get?\n\nLet's have a short trip through the software design patterns we use, the one we don't need anymore and the ones we wish had never been used - all with a pinch of object orientation and a dram of dynamism.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Faee/"
