description: "RubyConf 2016 - Problem Solved! Using Logic Programming to Find Answers by Gavin McGimpsey\n\nWe love Ruby's object orientation, and you might have heard functional programming is the new hotness. But don't leave home without one more paradigm! Logic programs express relations and constraints, allowing us to work with incomplete information, build knowledge systems, and find outputs of a system given whatever inputs are available.\n\nYou'll see examples of logic programs using Ruby, learn about an algorithm that searches for a solution in a finite problem space, and explore potential applications for logic programming approaches, both in practical areas and for your mental models."
