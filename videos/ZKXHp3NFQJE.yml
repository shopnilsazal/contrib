description: "Dead Addict, Hacking the Media, and Avoiding Being Hacked by the Media\nHackers have been demonized and romantisized in the media. Some hackers interactions with the media have caused their eventual incarseration, while others seem to pimp the media to promote their careers.\n\nDead Addict will provide a framework for manipulating the media and avoid being the victim of the media. While this talk will be relavent to hackers, it is applicable to all that consume or are consumed by media. \n\nDead Addict will also discuss methods to improve the quality of reporting and influence the media without appearing in it."
