description: "By Seth Vargo\n\nYou probably use Ruby everyday, so why not use Ruby to automate some common tasks?

What if you could effectively capture and replicate your production environments reliably and consistently? What if you could then give developers production-like environments as Virtual Machines, with no additional work? What if you could set up your new laptop with multiple Ruby versions, your favorite software, and even change the desktop background - from a single command? The good news is - you can!\n\nChef is a configuration management and automation tool that solves these problems and many m you'll learn common just how easy it is to capture your infrastructure in Chef. Save time and money by using Chef's Ruby DSL to \"define\" your laptop.\n\nHow many times have you bought a new laptop and realize just how much stuff you installed over the years? If you're using Chef, run a single command and all your favorite Applications, Preferences, and even passwords are back in place. And the best part - because Chef is written in Ruby, you get to continue using the language you love!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG6A/"
