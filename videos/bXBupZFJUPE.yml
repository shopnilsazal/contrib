title: 'PNWS 2014 - Composing Project Archetypes with SBT AutoPlugins'
recordingDate: 1418658996
description: "By, Mark Schaake\n\nSBT 0.13.5 introduced AutoPlugins as the future of SBT plugin development. AutoPlugins provide interesting features that simplify plugin development while enabling exciting new possibilities for plugin composition. At the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, we are composing some core AutoPlugins into \"Archetype\" plugins for Library, CLI, WebService, and WebApplication projects. This strategy has proven to greatly simplify our SBT builds while enforcing consistency across projects (something we value very much at AI2!).\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FoG6/"
