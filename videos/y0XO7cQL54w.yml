description: "by Daiki Ueno\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nOn a cloud computing environment it is often required to use a user's smartcard on a remote server. That is, insert a smart card locally (windows orlinux client), ssh to a server, and then utilize the smart card to 'sudo'application or to a TLS application, or to 'kinit' to obtain a kerberosticket. Other operating systems such as windows provide this functionality viaUSB-pass-through. The purpose of this talk, is to describe where we are, andwhat we provide for that problem.\n\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:00:00"
