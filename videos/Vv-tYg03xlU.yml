language: English
recordingDate: 1506637274
description: 'During Uber Engineeringâ€™s first Machine Learning Meetup on September 12, 2017, Chintan Turakhia describes how the Uber Marketplace (our real-time algorithmic decision engine) uses machine learning to power data-driven decision making and responses to the physical world. Examples include forecasting (predicting the future states of the marketplace based on supply and demand), personalization (to enable unique rider experiences), and dispatch (enabling seamless rider-driver matching on the platform).'
