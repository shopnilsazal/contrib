description: "Learning to Personalize\nNetflix instant video streaming represents an estimated one third of peak broadband traffic in the US. Personalization is at the core of our product with recommendations driving about 75% of all viewing. Building a high-quality recommendation system for millions of users requires a careful balancing act of handling large volumes of data, choosing and adapting good algorithms, keeping recommendations fresh and accurate, remaining responsive to user actions, and also being flexible to accommodate research and experimentation. In this talk, I will discuss how we use machine learning to drive our recommendation approach. I will describe some of the data, algorithms, metrics, and experimental methodology we use to effectively apply machine learning at scale. I will also highlight the evolution of our personalization approach from rating prediction to ranking to page generation."
