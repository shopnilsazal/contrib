description: "LN leads the architecture and design of Workday’s ML Platform and Services. He is all about building large scale distributed systems and data platforms. Currently his days (and some nights) are spent on solving the challenges in building ML products for Enterprise SaaS. LN’s career spans across HP, IBM Research, Symantec and now Workday. At Symantec, he was the architect and lead of a streaming platform that ingested and processed 2+ billions of events per day. As a Research Staff Member at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, LN built optimizations for automatic parallelization, techniques for approximate computing, deployment automation for OpenStack, and analytics for large scale cloud services.\n\nLN holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Colorado State University and has published more than 40 technical publications / patents. His work has received awards from ACM, IBM, and HP.\n\nAbstract Summary:\n\nLessons Learnt from building ML Products for enterprise SaaS:\nHaving spent the last 4+ years productizing ML powered enterprise products, we have learnt a lot! Join us to hear the stories of our stumbles (ahem learnings) in applying machine learning to solve business problems for Fortune 500 companies. Our hands-on experience has shaped our product strategy, ML platform design and organization’s operational principles. And the investments we made based on our learnings have helped us drastically improve our time to market for ML products. Come on by to hear the technical and organizational challenges (and some solutions) in building ML products for enterprise SaaS. Hopefully our learnings will be useful in your journey.\n\nSee the slides here: https://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/ln-renganarayana-architect-ml-platform-and-services-and-madhura-dudhgaonkar-head-of-engineering-search-data-science-and-machine-learning-workday-san-francisco"
