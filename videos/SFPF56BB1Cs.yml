description: "Functional Reactive Programming in JavaScript by: Charanjit Singh\n\nThe world of javascript and programming in general is moving towards creating more and more declarative abstractions/techniques for doing our things. Functional programming is a great way of doing flow based programming, and fortunately javascript has good support for functional programming. Functional Reactive programming is an old paradigm which has recently started catching developer attention, which allow making most of the complex asynchronous tasks declarative and really simple."
