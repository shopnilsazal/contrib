description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nSPIFFE Deep Dive - Andrew Jessup, Emiliano Berenbaum, Scytale, Inc., & Neel Shah, VMware (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nSPIFFE (Secure Production Infrastructure for Everyone) and SPIRE are two of the newest projects to join the CNCF. These projects build on designs first championed at Google, Twitter and elsewhere to provide robust authentication and trust between disparate micro-services in heterogeneous operating environments. This talk will expand on concepts introduced during the SPIFFE Intro Session to explore in detail how SPIRE performs attestation to workloads in diverse infrastructure and middleware settings, how it leans on different secrets storage backends and how PKI material is automatically delivered to a node and workload. The talk also will cover how these capabilities can be extended and customized through SPIRE&rsquo;s plugin framework. In this session,&nbsp;we will demo a Kerberos Node-Attestor for SPIRE in a Kubernetes cluster using the pluggable SPIRE model; Using Project Lightwave&mdash;an open source multi-tenanted and enterprise-grade Kerberized identity platform&mdash;we will demonstrate how enterprise identity stacks can be used to identify and trust the next generation of cloud-native workloads.\n\nAbout Emiliano\nHe is the CTO at Scytale, Inc.\n\nAbout Andrew\nAndrew is the co-founder of Scytale, who are helping bring SPIFFE into the world. Find out more at https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe Andrew is an engineer, and entrepreneur with a passion for building tools that help bring simplicity to software development. Prior to co-founding Scytale, Andrew was a product manager on Googleâ€™s Cloud Platform, launching many of the automation primitives on Google Compute Engine (including Auto-scaling, Managed Instance Groups, and Deployment Manager), helping improve developer workflow with the Spinnaker and Container Builder projects, and helping improve accessibility to developers and operations teams. As an Australian in the San Francisco Bay Area, Andrew spends most of his spare time trying to sell his Midwestern wife on the virtues of Vegemite.\n\nAbout Neel\nNeel Shah is a software engineer in the Cloud Native Group at VMware. At VMware, he has implemented secure dynamic DNS update with Kerberos GSS-API and actively works on an enterprise grade Kubernetes as a service solution. Outside of VMware, he maintains an open source SDN/NFV platform, OpenNetVM, and has worked on improving cloud security and reliability using Xen. As an open source contributor, Neel is deeply passionate about integrating distributed and low-level systems with security."
