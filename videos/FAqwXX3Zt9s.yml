description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nMonitoring: Follow the Data from the Darkest Corners of Kubernetes - Piotr Szczesniak, Google & Frederic Branczyk, CoreOS (Any Skill Level)\n\nHave you ever thought what are the sources of useful signals in Kubernetes? How to collect those data? The data that are crucial for understanding the system. How to ingest them to a human friendly tool and make them useful? In this talk Piotr and Frederic will cover Kubernetes native signal pipelines. The presenters will explain how to take advantage from them, extend and integrate with full blown monitoring solutions. The problem will be tackled holistically: from Cluster User, Cluster Administrator and Monitoring Vendor point of views.\n\n\"About Frederic\nFrederic is an engineer at CoreOS contributing to Prometheus and Kubernetes to build state of the art modern infrastructure and monitoring tools. He discovered his interest in monitoring tools and distributed systems in his previous jobs, where he used machine learning to detect anomalies indicating intrusion attempts. He also worked on projects involving secrets management for distributed applications to build sane and stable infrastructure.\n\nAbout Piotr\nPiotr is Tech Lead/Manager working at Google since 2014. He works on GKE/Kubernetes for 3 years, joining the project in its early days. Piotr leads GKE Monitoring team and Special Interest Group “Instrumentation” in Kubernetes open source community. Piotr graduated from University of Warsaw, Poland. During his studies Piotr was an intern at Google, Facebook and Samsung.\""
