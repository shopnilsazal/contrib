description: "Caskey L. Dickson and Jake Welch, Microsoft\n\nAt Microsoft SRE is not part of the current operational landscape, instead it is an ongoing project that is being adapted into a VERY mature company. Our team has been having to develop new and interesting ways to introduce SRE and its tenets to a traditional IT-Ops based organization. This process has proven to be quite complex and socially delicate. You can't go in to a team and just tell them they are doing things wrong even if they clearly are (as evidenced by their crushing operational load). You need to find the right way to show a developer all the warts on their baby and motivate them to work with you on addressing them. Furthermore you have to deal with their earnest desire to treat you as \"just another ops team\" who is only there to take the pager from them."
