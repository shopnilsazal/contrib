description: "Jun Liu, Baidu, Inc.\n\nIn China, shopping event is a most important marketing strategy of O2O, which is one of the fastest developing segments in the Chinese e-commerce market. There are shopping events almost every month in China, and the two biggest may be Singles Day (Chinaâ€™s Black Friday) and Chinese New Year. It is very challenging that SRE team keeps the website and mobile app high availability. The first challenge is that the traffic flow is much more than usual, and the second is that many different engineers and change events are involved in shopping event. Latency and data consistency are also important for tens of millions of online customers in the shopping day."
