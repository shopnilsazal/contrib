description: "Web APIs are how much of the modern web speaks - services speaking HTTP and JSON are ubiquitous, and nearly everything from your phone to your TV interacts with one of them.

In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nAugust 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
