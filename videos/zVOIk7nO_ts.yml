Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nKubernetes Multi-Cluster Operations without Federation - Rob Szumski, CoreOS (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nFederation is typically thought of as the only way to do multi-cluster operations, but that's not the case. I explore more secure and scalable methods for connecting clusters together. This is key to hybrid scenarios where you want two or more clusters set up in a consistent way, and then deploy an application in all regions or on all clouds. I will dive deep into sharing RBAC roles and resource limits, plus setting up the same namespaces with important default config like Pod Security Policies.\n\nAbout Rob\nRob Szumski is the Tectonic product manager at CoreOS, a provider of infrastructure software to securely run application containers anywhere. Focused on product design from open source to commercial offerings, Rob has deep experience in UX, web interfaces, and CLI. Rob likes to experiment with the technology he works on to understand it from both the developer's and the end user's side, which informs his design decisions. Prior to CoreOS, Rob was a product designer for developers in the cloud division at Rackspace."
