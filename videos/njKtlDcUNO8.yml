description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #11\n7 January 2018\nSponsored by Via, Hosted by Google Campus\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nBitcoin and the Blockchain have become increasingly used buzzwords in the past few years. The value of bitcoin has skyrocketed and is currently set at 1BTC~12000$(!!!). We hear of a new completely anonymous coin that can't be forged, can't be controlled (or printed) by any government and is completely distributed. While Bitcoin does introduce a truly revolutionary concept, it is not without flaws. In this talk we will discuss some of the technical specifications of Bitcoin, as well as some limitation and vulnerabilities of Bitcoin and the blockchain. We will learn how anyone can easily explore the blockchain using a simple python package (in fact there are many such packages). We will also attempt to see how data-science (and graph theory) techniques can be used to further explore the blockchain to try and gain some insight to the nature of the usage of Bitcoin today.\n\nMaya completed both her BSc. in Mathematics and her MSc. in Computer Science at the Hebrew university in Jerusalem. Her Masters thesis focused on High-dimensional combinatorics, graph theory and Markov processes. In the past she worked for several tech companies, focusing on performance enhancement of large scale systems, and the efficient integration between code and large scale databases. Today Maya is a PhD candidate at the Hebrew University, her focus is parallel and distributed computing.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
