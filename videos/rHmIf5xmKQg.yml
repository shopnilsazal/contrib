title: 'Functional Techniques for C# - Kathleen Dollard'
recordingDate: 1499706074
description: "You are effective with the imperative, object oriented core of .NET but you look longingly at the winsome smile of functional languages. Maybe you play with your language’s functional features, never quite sure you’re getting it right or taking full advantage of them.\n\nThis is the talk is for you. You’ll learn which code to attack with functional ideas and how to do it. You’ll watch code transform from long difficult to follow code to short code that’s easy to understand, hard to mess up and straightforward to debug. Better yet, functional approaches ensure that patterns like async, logging and exception handling are consistent and transaction usage is clear. Apply these techniques while leveraging delegates, lambda expressions, base classes and generics. You’ll leave this talk ready to implement these approaches in any version C# 3 or above.\n\n\nNote: Due to technical issues there is no picture from the stage throughout this talk."
