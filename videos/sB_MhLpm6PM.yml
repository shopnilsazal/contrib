description: "Renderman: New Wireless Fun From the Church Of WiFi\n\nAbstract: The Church of Wifi (reformed) has been busy coming up with new and wonderful wireless shenanigans. At Shmoocon we sped up WPA cracking 3 fold, at Layerone we made it even faster, now we take it even further, to places and sizes not dared before: WPA2! When we aren't breaking WPA or cavorting with Evil Bastards, we are thinking about the future. With so many networking devices running embedded OSS software, they are almost whole PC's unto themselves. Well, what happens when hardware goes viral? The Church raises the question, \"How do you trust your hardware?\" So bring your open minds and external hard drives, Church shouldn't ever be this fun. \n\nBios: Frank (\"Thorn\") Thornton Thorn runs his own technology-consulting firm, Blackthorn Systems, which specializes in wireless networks and security. An interest in Amateur Radio has also helped him bridge the gap between computers and wireless networks. Thorn's experience with computers goes back to the 1970's when he started programming mainframes. Over the last thirty years, he has used dozens of different Operating Systems and programming languages. In addition to his computer and wireless interests, Thorn was a Law Enforcement Officer for many years. As a detective and forensics expert he has investigated approximately one hundred homicides and thousands of other crime scenes. Combining both professional interests, he was a member of the workgroup that established ANSI Standard ANSI/NIST-CSL 1-1993 \"Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint Information.\" Thorn is a co-author of \"WarDriving: Drive, Detect, Defend\", \"Game Console Hacking\", \"RFID Security\" and contributor to \"IT Ethics\" all by Syngress Publishing. He resides in Vermont with his wife. RenderMan RenderMan has been a fixture in the wardriving community for many years. He never seems to be out of crazy projects and ideas, never very far from wardriving news, often causing it himself. He also co-authored \"RFID Security\" for Syngress publishing. He spends his time working on things like the 'stumbler ethic', Worldwide wardrive, 'the warpack' and the Church of Wifi. When not working to make wardriving an acceptable hobby, he can usually be found taking something apart, creating an army of cybernetic fluffins, trying to win the Defcon wardriving contest, or more likely, at the hotel bar. \n\nDavid \"H1kari\" Hulton David Hulton has been in the security field for the past 7 years and currently specializes in FPGA Logic Design, 802.11b Wireless Security, Smart Card, and GSM development specifically to exploit its various inherent strengths and weaknesses. David has spoken at numerous international conferences on Wireless Security, has published multiple whitepapers, and is regularly interviewed by the media on computer security subjects. David Hulton is one of the founding members of Pico Computing, Inc., a manufacturer of compact embedded FPGA computers and dedicated to developing revolutionary open source applications for FPGA systems. He is also one of the founding members of Dachb0den Research Labs, a non-profit security research think-tank, is currently the Chairman of the ToorCon Information Security Conference and has helped start many of the security and unix oriented meetings in San Diego, CA."
