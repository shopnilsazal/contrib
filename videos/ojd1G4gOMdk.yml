description: "A Guided Read of Minitest by Nate Berkopec\n\nMinitest is a testing library of just 1,500 lines of Ruby code. By comparison, Rspec clocks in at nearly 15,000! Why is Minitest so small? I'd like to investigate by doing a guided read of Minitest's source code.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H09k/"
