description: "By, Sam Phippen\nSpies are a relatively new feature in RSpec. In this tutorial-style talk: we'll look at what spies are, how spies work in RSpec and how one can write better tests with spies. We'll work through some of examples of writing new tests with spies, improving old tests with spies and the reasons why spying is a useful tool for your testing practice.\n\nIf you're new to RSpec and looking for ways to improve your testing practice, understand the library better or just ask some questions, this session will be great for you.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FrHG/"
