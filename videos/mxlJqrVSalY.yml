description: 'In this talk I''ll share my unique experiences as a trainer and author bringing Go to enterprise companies. We''ll talk about what works well, what needs improvement, and what we can do as a community to foster Go adoption in more companies. In 2016 I quit my job and set out to train the world on how to use Go and Kubernetes. Over the course of the last 18 months I''ve learned a lot of things about Go, and I want to share them with you in this talk.'
