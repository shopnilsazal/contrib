description: "RubyConf 2016 - Rainbows! Color Theory for Computers by Lito Nicolai\n\nWe often use color as a way to add information, whether in design, in UX, or for visualizations. When we visualize information, what's the best possible color scheme to use? How can we display the most possible information?\n\nThe only way to know is to explore the nature of color! We'll build up to the color-handling code that exists in 'graphics.rb', a Ruby-language visualizations library. For free, we'll end up with intuitive models of computer color spaces and tricks for how to think about common color concepts like gradients and paint mixing."
