description: "Domo Arigato mruby Roboto by Yurie Yamane and Maysayoshi Takahashi\n\nLet's make a self-balancing robot with mruby!\n\nWe show inverted pendulum robots using mruby. Inverted pendulum robot is two-wheeled, self-balancing robot like Segway. A self-balancing robot usually uses C or C++ because of real time responsibility, but we try to use mruby. We show you two robots, LEGO Mindstorms EV3 version and Raspberry Pi DIY version, and describe how to make them.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H0pd/"
