title: 'Ruby on Ales 2014 - Growing Distributed Systems'
recordingDate: 1399913768
description: "By Bryce Kerley\nDistributed systems are big, in every sense of the word. From the biggest social networks and search engines to the simplest web or iOS application, distributed software causes problems, stemming from its greatest feature: the system should continue working even when parts break. Client applications without network connections still want to capture data, backends with a failed service or two shouldn't break the entire application, and the app should still mostly work even when the big datacenter (you know the one) goes down. How do you grow a simple monolithic Rails app into a distributed system? What does it take to make your UI save data for a network connection later? How do you even test all this stuff?\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0q/"
