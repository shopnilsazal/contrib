description: "The Minimum Viable Conference by Kerri Miller & Jeremy Flores\n\nOk, so, if nothing else, we’ve got one thing in common. We like conferences. The two of us like ‘em so much that we recently spent a large chunk of time and money organizing and hosting one, and are planning at least one more for next year, too. Ask us about it!\nWe’re here to spill the beans on what it takes to make these things happen. We’ll do our damndest to tell you everything you need to know to get your own conference off the ground. We’ll cover topics like:\nHow many people do you need? To attend? To organize?\nWhere’s the money come from?\nHow do you get sponsors?\nHow do you run a CFP?\nWhat are the easy wins and hard losses?\nFor what services do you pay versus those you seek for free?\nHow do you protect yourself and your fellow organizers?\nWho buys the beer?\nWhether you’re planning a multi-day conference, a monthly meetup, or just a one-time get-together for your office, we’ll give you a handy list of DOs and DONTs, based on our own experiences and those of others in the community event game. Like Kerri’s Gramma once said, “If you want to go to a party, sometimes you have to throw it yourself.”\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/IMmv/"
