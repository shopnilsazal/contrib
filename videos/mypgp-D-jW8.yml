description: "Abstract: \nSecurity practitioners - the Sisyphus of information technology. We stand with a huge mass of developers creating new content every day, and we trust the training that we offer them, our own abilities as subject matter experts, in the tools we create and the methods we suggest. And still, the application security debt keeps growing and flaws we thought were already well-understood keep reappearing. This talk proposes yet another way of working with developers, testers and architects to address the gaps between training and coding, design and implementation, security testing and making sure that the security practitioner has enough timely information to be able to influence development rather than run after fixing the next version. These are supported by observation and interaction with many distinct development teams, feedback from peer practitioners, and pilot tests.\n\nby Izar Tarandach, Lead Product Security Architect of Autodesk Inc.\n\nIzar Tarandach is Lead Product Security Architect at Autodesk inc..
