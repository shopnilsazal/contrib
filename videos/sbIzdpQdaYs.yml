description: "\"Teeing up Python: Code Golf\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-12 - PyCharm Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nCode golfing is an interesting heuristic dedicated to minimizing the overall length of code to produce the same functionality. The result doesn’t have to be incomprehensible, and in fact, we can make the code more Pythonic in the process!\n\nConcise code helps future readers of the code understand the intent without getting distracted by implementation errata. We’ll cover numerous features of Python which allow complex ideas to be expressed concisely without sacrificing readability.  Broad subtopics:\n\n\nWhy even bother?\nDefault! The two sweetest words in the english language!\nThe Joy of Tuples\nComprehending Comprehensions\nWho’s afraid of Functional Programming?\nIdeas in Context Managers\n\n\nSlides: https://goo.gl/hGk7nX\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
