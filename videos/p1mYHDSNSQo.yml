description: "By, Stephen Compall\nAt first glance, the pattern matcher appears to be a mechanism merely for choosing among structural conditions of your data structures. However, scalac is much more powerful than that; many patterns have interesting type-level consequences on the other side of their associated rocketships. This is a powerful tool for modeling in a functional style, as well as a source of interesting type-system bugs. We'll examine various type-level effects of patterns, how you can use them to write safer programs, and what pitfalls arise in scalac's current implementation.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FnIS/"
