description: "by Anton Marchukov\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe world is not perfect and network failures do happen. Complaining aboutinstability might not always be enough. Especially when your system depends onmultiple networked services and each of them is on a critical path to thefinal result.\n\nThis talk will follow a real story of an attempt to implement network errorshandling by retries functionality that is inside urllib3 and requests Pythonlibraries. More importantly we will simulate poor network conditions on alocal machine using Linux Network Emulator and then will reason on howeffective the attempt was and what can be further improved.\n\nThis is a proper treatment the networked systems should get when they aredesigned, developed and tested. And it is great that all the tools necessaryare already there in most popular Linux distributions.\n\n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 12:35:00"
