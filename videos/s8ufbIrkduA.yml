description: "Using one of the many PHP frameworks, it easy to make quick progress in the early stages of a project. Often though this initial high velocity is short lived as complexities in the domain run into the technical constraints of the framework. This talk looks at some of the ways we can achieve better separation between our domain models and frameworks. By aiming to achieve this clean separation between model and framework from the start we can avoid projects becoming an unmaintainable ball of mud.\n\nhttps://joind.in/talk/view/11238\n\nSlides : https://speakerdeck.com/richardmiller/avoiding-the-mud"
