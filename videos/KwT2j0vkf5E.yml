description: "“Genomics saved my life.” – Jen\n“My father can rot in hell.” - Darren\n\nHow is personalized medicine important? Should I get a genomic test? Is the Illuminati collecting my data? What can I learn from genetic testing? What are the risks? How do I choose a test? Will my doctor hate me if I get a genetic test?\nThese questions won’t be answered in thirty minutes, but we offer grist for the discussion mill.\n\nWe will present two personal stories on how genomics can have a real effect on your medical treatment, your understanding of who you are, and how you live your life."
