description: 'Many of us get a few years into our career and get stuck in a rut. Maybe we stop reading about the latest and greatest in tech. Maybe we start managing and do less coding than we''d like. Maybe life gets in the way and coding becomes drudgery. One way to combat this feeling is to focus on learning. I''ll share what I''ve learned about juggling self improvement with being a professional programmer. I''ll talk about the courses, tools, books, and other resources I''ve found most useful. Youâ€™ll leave this talk with several ideas for breaking out of your own developer rut.'
