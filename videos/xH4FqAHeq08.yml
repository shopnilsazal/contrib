description: "Arup Chakrabarti, PagerDuty\n\nGetting customers to care about Reliability is hard. Getting stakeholders to care about Reliability is harder. Getting the entire company to care about Reliability is even harder.\n\nIn this talk, I will cover what steps that every leader in any organization can take to get more people to care about Reliability. Because Reliability is one of those things that people only notice when it goes in the wrong direction, it can be hard to show the value of it and why it is so important.\n\nWe will walk through cultural and management changes, metrics to watch and obsess over, and some tooling that can help along the way.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
