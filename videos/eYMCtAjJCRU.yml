description: "Scaling Payments With Your Growing Business by Vaibhav Kaul | Nicole Grazioso \n\nEight years ago SeatGeek processed exactly zero payments, instead sending customers to checkout across various other ticketing partners. Today SeatGeek helps millions of fans attend live events each year, and every one of them seamlessly purchases from the thousands of sellers on the site. SeatGeek now works with some of the marquee teams, venues and leagues around the world, including teams from the NFL, NBA, MLS and English Premier League.\n\n​​Scaling payment solutions to keep up with the needs of a rapidly growing company is challenging. In this session the payment team at SeatGeek will talk about the evolution of the company as a marketplace, and how Spreedly has helped it scale and plan for the future."
