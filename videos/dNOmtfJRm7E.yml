description: "by Jenny Wong\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nWhat happens when you stop looking at diversity and instead put accessibilityinto the core of an event? This talk will be about the experience of doingexactly that. We will be looking into some of the solutions WordCamp Londoncame up with and the cost of building accessibility into a project.\n\nWe talk about accessibility a lot when we write code, whether that is writinggood documentation, comment blocks or creating a good user experience. When itcomes to our user groups and events, accessibility is not usually on theforefront of our minds.\n\nAt WordCamp London, the organising team made accessibility the key goal of theevent. We wanted to see how far we could push being accessible and how mucheffort it would take.\n\nThis talk is for any event organisers, community evangelists or managers whoare looking for solutions to help grow their communities. Wong will be talkingabout the challenges of organising an accessible event, including how theydegendered content, added child care facilities and helped the hard ofhearing. We will look at the cost of each accessible feature, explore theunexpected benefits of an accessible event and discuss the lessons were learnton the way.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.119 (Moved from AW1.124)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:15:00"
