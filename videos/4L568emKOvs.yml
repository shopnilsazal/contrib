description: "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nThere are several tools to build ML dashboards and visulisations. Their focus is often on making it as simple as possible for a (Python) data scientist. Shipp ing them as part of our product means that other roles like frontend developers get involved. Aspects that ease development for one role, create pains for oth ers. We want to show how balance this using Altair, Vega and Vue.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/xhochy/pydata-amsterdam-2018-building-customervisible-data-science-dashboards-with-altair-vega-vue\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
