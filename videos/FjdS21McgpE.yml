description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nYAML is for Computers. ksonnet is for Humans - Bryan Liles, Heptio (Any Skill Level)\n\nYAML as a configuration language for Kubernetes means the configuration is accessible to the API service and mostly accessible to humans. The open source project, ksonnet, provides an intuitive way to create and edit Kubernetes configuration files in a declarative fashion. It also allows configuration of applications across multiple environments. In this session, the audience will be introduced to the world of easier Kubernetes configurations. They will learn how to simplify their deployments, take advantage of reusable components, and integrate with other tools. They will be able to do this while reducing complexity by separating parameters from resources. Finally, we will review why GitOps is an important technique for ensuring your organization always knows what is in production. At the conclusion the audience will be able to immediately start integrating ksonnet into their stacks.\n\nAbout Bryan\nBryan Liles is developer with Heptio. He currently works on the ksonnet project looking for ways to make configuring Kubernetes easier for users. Previously, Bryan was an early engineer at DigitalOcean, worked on disease discovery models, and has spent 20 years in the greater open source community."
