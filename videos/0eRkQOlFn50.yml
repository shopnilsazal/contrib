description: "I See You\nBrian Wohlwinder, Andrew Beard\n\nIn this talk, we will dive into the data captured during last years Wall of Sheep applications and protocols that are giving your away credentials. This is something that anyone, with the right level of knowledge and inclination, could certainly do with a few basic ingredients. We will enumerate them. The dataset we will focus on was gathered as part of the Wall of Sheep contest during DEF CON 22. While this data was gathered using an off the shelf technology, that platform will not be the topic we discuss. Rather, we will focus on the types and scope of data sent totally in the clear for all to see. Additionally, we will discuss the ramifications this might have in a less \"friendly\" environment -- where loss of one's anonymity, might really, really suck. Finally, we will discuss and recommend ways you can hamper this type of collection.\n\nBIO: Brian Wohlwinder In his role as Manager of Threat for Fidelis Cybersecurity Systems, Brian is responsible for developing and evolving the company's threat detection strategy while synchronizing it with product strategy. Before \"retiring,\" Brian also held a number of roles, in a wide range of cyber programs within the Department of Defense and associated Joint Community; his military service includes stints as a Cyberspace Strategist for the Air Force Space Command, Mission Commander at the Joint Functional Component Command - Network Warfare, Chief of Space Systems Integration, Network Engineer, Programmer, Systems Analyst, and Rated Flight Engineer. In addition to extensive training in the military, Brian also received his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Charleston Southern University and a Master's degree in Business Administration from The Citadel Military College.\n\nAndrew Beard Andrew is the Manager of Threat Systems for Fidelis Cybersecurity and is a native of the DC metro area. In his role, he manages a small team that is primarily responsible for processing threat intel at scale. He holds a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, with a minor in Dance Dance Revolution. He is a connoisseur of astronaut ice cream and somewhat begrudgingly takes slow, meandering walks with his French Bulldog, Fudge. He is often accused of being Gordon Freeman's evil twin and insists that no one is too old to own action figures."
