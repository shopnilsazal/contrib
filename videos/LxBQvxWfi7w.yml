title: 'RubyConf 2010 - Rev, Revactor, Reia by: Tony Arcieri'
recordingDate: 1428419632
description: 'Come with us now on a journey through time and space. From the EventMachine and Rev event frameworks to the Revactor Actor frameworkTony Arcieri explores the people and ideas that lead him to the Reia programming language, as well as the ideas of people like Zed Shaw of Mongrel, Ry Dahl of Node.js, and Ilya Grigorik of em-synchrony. We all love Ruby, but it has its foibles, especially when dealing with issues like concurrency and I/O. Reia is a new programming language which serves up Erlang sandwiches on warm, crispy, delcious Ruby-flavored buns. Reia makes it easier to solve the kinds of problems which are presently difficult in Ruby, such as building complex distributed systems which can automatically leverage all of the cores of a host CPU. Reia lets you build Erlangy systems with robust distribution, fault tolerance, and concurrency, all without having to deal with Erlangâ€™s nasty syntax.'
