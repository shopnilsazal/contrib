recordingDate: 1398361707
description: "Ember is a framework for creating ambitious web applications. Ambitious applications need tests. Although many find it difficult to weed through the various sources of information, it is possible to thoroughly test your Ember application today. We've aggregated the collective experiences, trials and errors regarding testing Ember applications from leaders in the Ember community to create The Unofficial, Official Ember Testing Guide. We'll walk through it live, cover specific testing scenarios and solve real testing dilemmas.\n\nYou'll leave this session knowing what to test, how to approach it with confidence, and the resources available to fall back on when you need it.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2Q/"
