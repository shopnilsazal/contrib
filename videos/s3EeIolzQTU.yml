title: 'Easy site migration using Diazo and Funnelweb - Mr. Adam Terrey'
recordingDate: 1314070664
description: 'Moving old sites into a new web platform is a pain. Often you need to pull apart perfectly good HTML just to spend time painstakingly putting back together again and converting hundreds of pages of content is a chore. Recently PretaWeb used tools to drastically simplify this process when converting genetics.edu.au to Plone 4.1. Diazo is a platform independent theming engine that leaves HTML untouched. Funnelweb is a static content migration tool for crawling and manipulating site content.'
