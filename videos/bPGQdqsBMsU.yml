description: "Chuck Reeves\n\nIn today's growing software field, many developer are being asked questions to estimate how long new features or bug fixes, will take to complete. I have heard many ways of using \"formulas\" to estimate time, but none of them have any mathematical backing. In this session I talk about simple ways to improve your estimation by calibrating your intuitive nature to estimate. I will also explain how to use some simple mathematically sound techniques to providing project owners with more accurate estimates.\n\nhttps://joind.in/talk/view/11229\n\nSlides : http://www.slideshare.net/manchuck/stop-multiplying-by-4-php-tour-2014"
