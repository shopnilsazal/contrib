title: 'DEF CON 18 - Sam Bowne - Who Cares About IPv6?'
recordingDate: 1383698806
description: "Sam Bowne - Who Cares About IPv6?\nWhat is IPv6? Why should you care? If we ignore it, will it just go away?\n\nThe current Internet Protocol numbering scheme, IPv4, is nearing its end-of-life. Within two years, all the IPv4 numbers will be allocated, so that new devices will not be able to connect directly to the Internet. We all will be forced to adapt to the new IPv6 system soon. But how can we get started?\n\nThis talk explains why IPv6 is necessary, how it works, and how everyone can quickly and easily start using it now. I will explain and demonstrate how to set up a free tunnel to access the Internet via IPv6.\n\nI will also explain the Hurricane Electric IPv6 certifications. The certifications are great because they guide a novice through the stages of IPv6 knowledge: connecting as a client, setting up an IPv6-enabled Web server, email server, DNS server, and glue records.\n\nThere are large security implications to IPv6 too. I will explain several important IPv6 vulnerabilities and countermeasures, including auto-configuration privacy risks, torrents over IPv6, bypassing VPNs with IPv6, Routing Header Zero packet amplification attacks, and the ping-pong IPv6 DoS vulnerability.\n\nMy goal is to convince the audience to pay attention to IPv6 and to guide them to an easy way to start learning about it and using it now. All my students at City College San Francisco will have IPv6 homework from now on--you need to get on board now or be left behind!\n\nSam Bowne has been teaching computer networking and security classes at CCSF since 2000. He has given talks at DEFCON and Toorcon on Ethical Hacking, and taught classes and seminars at many other schools and teaching conferences. Sam is a Hurricane Electric Certified IPv6 Sage. He also has a B.S. in Physics from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania and a Ph.D. in Physics from University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. His Industry Certifications are: Certified Ethical Hacker, Microsoft: MCP, MCDST, MCTS: Vista; Network+, Security+, Certified Fiber Optic Technician.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
