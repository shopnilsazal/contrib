title: '0-60 with Goliath: building high-performance (Ruby) web services  Ilya Grigorik'
recordingDate: 1326934400
description: "Goliath is an open source, event-driven I/O framework, much like node.js or Tornado, except that Goliath is based on EventMachine, features a Ruby API, and most importantly, does away with the asynchronous \"callback muck\" by utilizing Ruby 1.9's Fibers to preserve the nice synchronous look-and-feel of your codeâ€”which makes it easier to write, test, and maintain.\n\nIn this talk we will first explore why Goliath was built, and why the combination of Ruby 1.9, Fibers, and an asynchronous event-loop is such a powerful combination. We will take a look under the hood and work through several \"Hello World\" examples: streaming uploads and responses, websockets, and the general async API use cases. Further, we'll take a brief look at lessons learned from production deployments and what we've discovered while building Goliath at PostRank.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGk3/"
