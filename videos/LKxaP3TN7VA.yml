description: "Web Rebels is coming back in 2019 https://webrebels.org\n\nMonika is a full stack developer who loves challenges - whether it’s solving problems of all kinds, learning new things, or climbing mountains. Her day job involves writing server side code in Scala and taking care of infrastructure and databases. She likes to keep it fun by making WebXR demos and sharing the joy of VR at conferences. She’s a huge fan of functional programming and well written documentation.\n\nBuilding virtual worlds with web technologies\nWe will explore the landscape of virtual reality on the web, look at where it started and where it’s heading and then we’ll dive into how to create a multi-user interactive experience available on all platforms. For this we’ll use Mozilla’s A-Frame library, which makes it easy and fun to get into WebXR. We will have a look at how to compose scenes with HTML-like syntax from a range of components and how to modify them in the in-browser editor."
