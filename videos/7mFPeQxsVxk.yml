description: "Uber Engineering discusses how we think about networking to connect the mobile devices in our platform's ecosystem. Networking is one of the most important, yet often underserved aspects of any mobile application. The round-trip time and throughput of mobile networks can vary greatly between cities and even within cities, performance ranges from broadband LTE speeds to something that feels more like a 300 baud modem.\n\nFor more info see: https://eng.uber.com \n\n===================================================\nMore on the Uber Engineering Mobility Meetups Series\nhttps://www.uber.com/p/uber-mobility/\n\nWelcome to Uber Mobility, a meetup series focused on building scalable, high-quality mobile applications. The platform-agnostic topics today will help you build better mobile applications at scale for a global market.\n\nHaving the right testing strategy and good automation coverage are both essential for any mobile company wanting to iterate quickly and release high quality apps faster. So is having confidence in your mobile application build before you release. Once released, fixing problems is hard: you can’t roll back bad builds quickly and you can’t control whether users will actually upgrade to your hotfix build.\n\nThis evening is all about testing applications: from writing consistent and deterministic tests, to setting up scaleable CI systems, to effectively distributing tests on CI, to setting the right cadence and release strategy. You will learn from other industry forerunners who have successfully implemented these strategies at their companies, and you will learn how to ensure the continued growth of your business by using effective testing.\n\nMore on Uber Engineering Events: http://www.meetup.com/UberEvents/"
