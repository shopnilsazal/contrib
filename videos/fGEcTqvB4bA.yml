title: 'GeeCON 2017: Sebastian Malaca - Do you really know how to create your objects?'
recordingDate: 1502694958
description: 'When we talk about objects, we think about their behaviors, attributes and interactions. We think about the things they help us achieve. Yet, before any object can participate in any kind of operation or calculation, we first have to create it. Easy? Well, sometimes it is harder than you expect. Unfortunately as developers we tend to tackle even the simplest problem in an over-complicated way. During the talk I will show you the ways of creating objects and I will present you all problems that come with each solution. I will also talk about the problems that become more visible when you create your objects in the right way.'
