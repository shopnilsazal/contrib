description: "RailsConf 2017: We've Always Been Here: Women Changemakers in Tech by Hilary Stohs-Krause\n\nSteve Jobs. Linus Torvalds. Alan Turing.\n\nBeen there, done that.\n\nThe interesting stories often aren’t the ones we grew up with; they’re the ones we’ve left behind. When it comes to tech, that means its women, and especially its women of color. And while there’s been a greater emphasis lately on rediscovering women’s contributions to technology, we need to expand our focus beyond just Grace Hopper and Ada Lovelace.\n\nFrom Radia Perlman to Sophie Wilson to Erica Baker, let's explore both tech’s forgotten heroes and its modern-day pioneers, and help end the silent erasure of women in technology."
