title: 'Hanjun Dai, Graph Representation Learning with Deep Embedding Approach'
recordingDate: 1505953711
description: "Hanjun Dai is a PhD student in School of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. Le Song. His research focuses on deep learning and its application for static and temporal-dynamic graphs. He has applied his method on molecule learning, social network, recommendation system and natural language. He received best student paper award in AISTATS and best paper in Recsys workshop on Deep Learning for Recommendation System. This summer he interned at Amazon AI Research on large scale graph embedding.\n\nGraph Representation Learning with Deep Embedding Approach:\nGraphs are commonly used data structure for representing the real-world relationships, e.g., molecular structure, knowledge graphs, social and communication networks. The effective encoding of graphical information is essential to the success of such applications. In this talk I’ll first describe a general deep learning framework, namely structure2vec, for end to end graph feature representation learning. Then I’ll present the direct application of this model on graph problems on different scales, including community detection and molecule graph classification/regression. We then extend the embedding idea to temporal evolving user-product interaction graph for recommendation. Finally I’ll present our latest work on leveraging the reinforcement learning technique for graph combinatorial optimization, including vertex cover problem for social influence maximization and traveling salesman problem for scheduling management."
