description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Wolfram Rittmeyer, OpenMinds.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-66\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/writtmeyer/kotlin-dsls\n\nKotlin is not just about null safety or data classes. Kotlin has much more to offer. One of the nice things is the ability to use Kotlin's features to create domain specific languages (DSLs).\n\nIn this talk you will see samples of DSLs you can use in your Android projects and learn how they work.\n\nKotlin DSLs are actually made of many simple Kotlin features - some of which you surely already use, some of which are a bit more obscure. But combined together they give us a powerful way to create nice DSLs.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
