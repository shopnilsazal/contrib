description: "Abstract:\nWhat would you see occurring that would let you know that your security capabilities are improving while the business scales? Scale meaning more staff, more systems, more software, more cloud platforms/apis, more third parties and more regions/markets all growing with more speed. This talk will focus on methods of measurement, with code, that will help you answer these questions.\n\nby Richard Seiersen, SVP/CISO of Lending Club\n\nWebsite: howtomeasureanything.com/cybersecurity/\n\nRichard is a security executive with ~20 years experience ranging from start-ups to global organizations.
