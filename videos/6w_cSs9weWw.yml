description: "RailsConf 2017: Panel: Ruby's Killer Feature: The Community with Christopher Sexton, Sean Marcia, Latoya Allen, & Zuri Hunter\n\nWhat makes Ruby so wonderful? The Community.\n\nThe community around Ruby is really what sets it apart, and the cornerstone of it is the small local meetups. Come learn how to get involved, help out, or step up and start a local group of your own. We will discuss how to develop and nurture the group. Share our experiences in expanding a small group to larger events like unconferences or workshops. Find out how community leaders can help everyone build a solid network, assist newbies in kick-starting their career, and most importantly ensure that everyone feels welcome and safe."
