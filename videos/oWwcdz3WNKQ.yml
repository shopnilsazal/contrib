description: "With Go, developers use many different setups, one of the most common being editors in combination with command line tools. So one might question how using this setup differs from an IDE. What benefits does the latter provide?\n\nWe’re going to share the journey of us having written a Go IDE based on IntelliJ Platform. We’ll see how IntelliJ provides the infrastructure for building static analysis engines. Inspections, with their quick fixes, “Find Usages” of symbols, refactorings and navigation are made possible when the code being analysed.\n\nWe’ll see some of these benefits and the challenges confronted in the process."
