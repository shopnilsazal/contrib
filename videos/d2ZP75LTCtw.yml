description: 'Recently MetricFu, a ruby gem for creating many code metrics, added Hotspots. Now you can see where in your code you have multiple problems at once. Wouldn''t you want to know if you have complex code that changes a lot in source control AND has bad coverage? Of course you would. I''ll show you how to use MetricFu to find the worst code in your application and then how to fix it.'
