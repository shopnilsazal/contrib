description: "By, Terence Lee\nIn Ruby, it's easy to create classes, methods, and objects. For instance, did you know that a hello world sinatra app uses 43 classes, 155 methods, and dispatches 548 methods for a single request. In this talk, we're going use TracePoint API to look at how you can find out this information among other things. Additionally, now that we have all these objects from our Ruby app, the evolving ObjectSpace API we can glean information about rough object size in memory. Let's take a walk through objects in Ruby.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GUQG/"
