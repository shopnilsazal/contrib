description: "As a mentor for thoughtbot's Prime service, I've provided coaching to over 100 developers.\n\nIn my talk, I'll share the questions I'm asked repeatedly, and how I answer them.\n\nThis discussion will be targeted at beginner and intermediate developers striving to improve.\n\nLikely discussion includes:\n\nWhat should I do if I inherit an app with no tests?\nAny advice on how to switch to vim?\nHow does one land her first Rails job?\nHow does one land a better Rails job?\nHow do I conquer the fear of letting others see my code?\nAm I underpaid?\nHow do I balance integration and isolated tests?\nHow can I make myself stick to TDD when the going gets tough?\nPlus, because it's me, we're gonna do some live coding. Take bad code. Make good. Happy times.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4f/"
