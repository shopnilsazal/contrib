recordingDate: 1528976864
description: "Johan will demonstrate how you can use basic machine learning to understand differences between narratives of political parties, based on natural language, open data from a voting advice application in Finnish elections. We will even ponder some ethical and methodological issues arising in machine learning!\n\nThen you’ll see how similar algorithm is applied to completely different data in a full blown recommendation engine! Let’s hear out how this worked in the real world at YLE the Finnish Broadcasting Company, and what it took in addition to machine learning algorithms.\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018.
