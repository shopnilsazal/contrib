description: "Croteam is a small team, yet their games were always ambitious in both scope of production and quality. To make it possible, Alen Ladavac explained, during a talk at GDC Europe 2015, how the company established a general approach concentrating on enabling fast iteration which led to its successful puzzle-based first-person title The Talos Principle. The result is an environment of tools and services which help them work as efficiently as possible. \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
