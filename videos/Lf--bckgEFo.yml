description: "Using Postgres to \\watch Star Wars! by Will Leinweber\n\nStar Wars is a movie, and Postgres is a database. And what better way to watch a movie than using only a database? I mean, aside from in a theater, or on a TV, or on a tiny airplane screen, or… So while I guess I can’t say it’s the best way, I can for sure say that it is a way.\n\nEven if you don’t go and watch all your movies this way in the future, you’ll learn how to combine several unrelated features in unexpected ways, and that’s where all the fun comes from in programming!leinweiber"
