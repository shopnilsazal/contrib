language: English
recordingDate: 1450308129
description: "Vulnerability Assessment is, by some, regarded as one of the least “sexy” capabilities in information security. However, it is the presenter’s view that it is also a key component of any successful infosec program, and one that is often overlooked. Doing so serves an injustice to the organization and results in many missed opportunities to help ensure success in protecting critical information assets. The presenter will explore how Vulnerability Assessment can be leveraged “Beyond the Scan” and provide tangible value to not only the security team, but the entire business that it supports.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDamon Small began his career studying music at Louisiana State University. Pursuing his desire to actually make money, he took advantage of computer skills learned in the LSU recording studio to become a systems administrator in the mid 1990s. Following the dotcom bust in the early 2000s, Small began focusing on cyber security. This has remained his passion, and over the past 15 years as a security professional he has supported infosec initiatives in the healthcare, defense, and oil and gas industries. In addition to his Bachelor of Arts in Music, Small completed the Master of Science in Information Assurance degree from Norwich University in 2005.\n\nTwitter: @damonsmall"
