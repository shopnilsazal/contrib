title: 'RailsConf 2015 - Curly — Rethinking the View Layer'
recordingDate: 1430926140
description: "by Daniel Schierbeck\n\nWhile most parts of Rails have been thoroughly overhauled during the past few years, one part has stubbornly refused improvement. The view layer is still by default using ERB to transform your app’s objects into HTML. While trying to solve a seemingly unrelated problem we discovered a design that suddenly enabled us to move past the limitations of ERB while still integrating closely with Rails. We could now separate presentation logic from display structure; reason about our views and how they relate; and dramatically improve our code. We called the library Curly, and it's pretty awesome."
