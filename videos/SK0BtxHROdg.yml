description: "\"Bringing Python to Godot game engine\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - PyCharm Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nhttps://godotengine.org/\nGodot is an advanced, feature-packed, multi-platform 2D and 3D open source game engine.\nThe project has joined the Software Freedom Conservancy project and it growing community makes it hopes to become a real alternative to Unity&amp;GameMaker.\n\nThis talk cover a year long journey of the port of Python as a scripting language for the engine, starting from a rant against Godot's Python-like proprietary language.\n\nWe will have a look at Godot's internal architecture as  is it itself a real interpreter with it garbage collector, dynamic typing, introspection and even builtin custom scripting language. All of this having to work next to our Python interpreter and communicate back and forth with it.\n\nFinally we will see the different approaches that have been tried to bind Python to Godot each with there own pros&amp;cons:\n\n\nUsing Micropython interpreter instead of CPython\nUsing PyBind11 to statically bind to Godot C++ API\nUsing CFFI and rely on a 3rd party C API\n\nThe audience should have some basic knowledge of C level computing (static vs dynamic language, compilation &amp; linking).\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
