description: "Jon McCoy - Hacking .Net Applications: A Dynamic Attack\nWhat do you do when you get inside of a .Net program? This presentation will demonstrate taking full advantage of the .Net world from the inside. Once inside of a program don't just put in a key-logger, remold it! I will presentation a how to infiltrate, evaluate, subvert, combine, and edit .Net applications at Runtime. The techniques demonstrated will focus on the modification of core logic in protected .Net programs.\n\nThis will make almost every aspect of a target program susceptible to evaluation and change; and allow such hacks as the ability to intermix your favorite applications into a new Frankenstein App, compromise program level security, reverse engineer from memory, modify events, edit the GUI, hunt malware, get the code behind a button, and/or subvert program locks. Demo implementation and tools will be released.\n\nThe coding techniques presented will be applicable well beyond compromising the security of a running program. These techniques will grant programmers a new level of access and control over any .Net code, as well as granting the ability to use and integrate with most any .Net application. Creating a development path to test and build 3rd party patches within .Net.\n\nJon McCoy has been working in .NET since v1.1. He enjoys bending the rules and finding different and new ways to utilize .Net.\n\nHe is a software engineer, both self taught and classically trained. He spent more then 10 years programming C++, but has focused on C#(.NET) for the last 7 years.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
