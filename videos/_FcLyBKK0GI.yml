description: "From AppSecEU 2014 in Cambridge\nhttps://2014.appsec.eu/\n\nToday mobile devices and their application marketplaces drive the entire economy of the mobile landscape. For instance, Android platforms alone have produced staggering revenues exceeding 9 billion USD, which unfortunately attracts cybercriminals with malware now hitting the Android markets at an alarmingly rising pace.\n\nTo better understand this slew of threats, in this talk I present CopperDroid, an automatic VMI-based dynamic analysis system to reconstruct the behavior of Android malware.  Based on the key observation that all interesting behaviors are eventually expressed through system calls, CopperDroid presents a novel unified analysis able to capture both low-level OS-specific and high-level Android-specific behaviors. \n\nExtensive evaluation on more than 2,900 Android malware samples, show that CopperDroid faithfully describes OS- and Android-specific behaviors and, through the use of a simple yet effective app stimulation technique, successfully triggers and discloses additional behaviors on more than 60% (on average) of the analyzed malware samples, qualitatively improving code coverage of dynamic-based analyses.\n\n\nSpeaker\n\nLorenzo Cavallaro\nSenior Lecturer (~Associate Professor), Royal Holloway University of London\nLorenzo Cavallaro is a Senior Lecturer of Information Security in theInformation Security Group at Royal Holloway University of London.His research interests focus on systems security, and malware analysisand detection. | | Lorenzo is Principal Investigator on the 4-year EPSRC-funded BACCHUSgrant EP/L022710/1 \"MobSec: Malware and Security in the Mobile Age\"(Jun 2014--Jun 2018), Principal Investigator on the 3-yearEPSRC-funded CEReS grant EP/K033344/1 \"Mining the Network Behavior ofBots\" (Jun... \n\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
