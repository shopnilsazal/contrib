description: "How Compose uses Rails to Scale Work, Now Open-Sourced By JP Phillips\n\nCompose is committed to making remote work work. Our biggest hurdle is communication and teamwork. When we joined forces with IBM, we added a new issue - how to scale. So, our devs built an app we’re open-sourcing called Fizz. Built on Rails, Fizz helps us empower our team to do great work, feel like family, and operate happily and efficiently as an international, remote, self-managing organization. We work transparently, commit to open-source, wear sweatpants, and genuinely enjoy each other and we’re committed to keeping it that way. We harnessed the power of Rails to make that happen.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/JXxs/"
