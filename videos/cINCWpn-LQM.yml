title: 'RailsConf 2014 - Rack-AMQP: Ditch HTTP Inside SOA! by Josh Szmajda'
language: English
recordingDate: 1399402003
description: "We're comfortable with HTTP, but using it for communication in your SOA isn't simple. You need load balancers, URL discovery, SSL, and there's a cost to set up and tear down that HTTP window.\n\nRack-AMQP lets you serve your rack (and rails) apps over AMQP, a robust, open protocol for messaging. You get simple queues, load balancing, security, and persistent connections for free (plus pub-sub!)â€”without changing your app.\n\nLearn the pitfalls of HTTP and why you should use AMQP in your SOA!\n\nJosh is the host of the Ruby Hangout, an online Ruby meetup. Josh also coorganizes DCRUG and is the CTO at Optoro, a Washington, DC startup in the reverse logistics industry. Josh has been developing web applications with HTTP for 16 years and thinks that SOAs should think differently.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1i/"
