description: "Test Your Legacy Rails Code by: Noel Rappin\n\nEverybody wants to do test-driven development, but switching to TDD or BDD on an existing project that doesn't have tests presents special challenges. Often, the current code is a tangled mess of dependencies that defeats the very concept of unit testing. Worse, if somebody has attempted TDD in the past, you might have a test suite that needs to be fixed before any new tests can be written.\n\nDon't give up. Adding test-coverage and TDD to your application will make it easier.\n\nThis session will describe techniques that you can use to bootstrap a test-driven process into your project. You'll see how to use \"black-box\" techniques that don't depend on the structure of the code and \"white-box\" techniques that interact with the code more directly.\n\nTopics covered will include:\n\n* Using Cucumber to perform black-box testing.\n* Using RSpec to perform white-box testing\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GtjE/"
