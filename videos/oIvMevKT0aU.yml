description: "Microservices are a great model for developing modern applications. But microservice based architectures are more complicated than traditional monolithic apps and can come with a significant management overhead particularly when you need to maintain different environments for dev, test and production. This overhead either falls on your development team or to people you hire specifically to manage it. \nThis talk with multiple demos, looks at how to build, test and deploy container based microservice architectures without having to worry about managing the platform on which they run, thus freeing up your developers to do what they do best, writing application code.\nWe'll look at new and enhanced features of Google App Engine and walk through the staged deployment of both a simple application and a more complicated microservices based architecture. We'll also look at how App Engine has evolved from it's original sandboxed runtime environment to what it is today, a next generation platform for building and deploying modern day applications.\n\nPresented by Ludovic CHAMPENOIS"
