description: "Best of Both Worlds: Building a Mirror-trading Platform on Top of the {Java|Ruby} Ecosystem by Thilo Alexander Ginkel\n\nJRuby may not immediately come to mind when thinking about implementing a platform for foreign-exchange and stock transactions. \n\nThis talk may prove you wrong. It will give some insights and hands-on experience into how using JRuby made our work a lot easier when building and operating a mirror-trading platform on top of an asynchronous and concurrent message-passing architecture. Indeed, by using JRuby one can benefit from Ruby's sleek syntax and elegant programming model while also tapping into the rich set of trading platform integrations available in the Java world. Furthermore, the talk will elucidate the unique robustness and monitoring advantages that we gained in our project from running our stack on top of the JVM using the Tanuki service wrapper for uninterrupted operation and monitoring various components through JMX."
