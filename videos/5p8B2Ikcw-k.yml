recordingDate: 1527478207
description: "PyData London 2018 \n\nThis talk will focus on the importance of correctly defining an anomaly when conducting anomaly detection using unsupervised machine learning. It will include a review of Isolation Forest algorithm (Liu et al. 2008), and a demonstration of how this algorithm can be applied to transaction monitoring, specifically to detect money laundering.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/unsupervised-anomaly-detection-with-isolation-forest-elena-sharova\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
