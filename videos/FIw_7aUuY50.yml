title: 'PyCon UK 2016: Test Driven data Analysis (Q&A Truncatred)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1477387611
description: "Nick Radcliffe\n\nPlease note: The recording of the Q&A for this session was truncated because someboy unpluged the camera and the battery ran out.\n\nTest-driven data analysis (TDDA) seeks to take some of the ideas and practices from test-driven development and apply them, with appropriate modifications, to avoid some of the common pitfalls in data analysis. While some of the ideas carry over straightforwardly, both the way data analysis is typically developed and the nature of data analysis tasks mean that mainstream TDD ideas need to be modified and extended to be fully effective in the context of data analysis.\n\nThis talk will compare and contrast mainstream TDD and TDDA, and talk about the challenges and ideas for developing further this important new area.\n\nSlides: http://www.tdda.info/pdf/tdda-pycon-cardiff-2016-slides.pdf"
