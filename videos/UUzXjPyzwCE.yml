recordingDate: 1528976967
description: "In a world of increasingly sophisticated digital services, how can we make sure that we reach a genuine understanding of the user experience? With the opportunity of creating fluid, seamless experiences - integrating to our environments and bodies, climbing out of our screens and onto various surfaces - also comes great challenges of identifying new forms of user value. With disruptors increasingly looking at tapping into emotional value creation, designers need to level-up on their methods for reaching deeper human insights. What does this mean in practice? And what kind of approaches will help us to stay relevant in the future, too?\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018. For more information, check reaktorbreakpoint.com. \n\n---\n\nIsabella Holm\nHuman Insights Lead, Reaktor\n\nIsabella is a recognised expert on our changing relationship with technology and digital services. Sheâ€™s a human insights specialist with a special focus on future scenarios and the human experience.
