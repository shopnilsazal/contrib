description: "Code is Required by Aaron Patterson\n\nYou can't talk about running code without talk about loading code. Part of improving the performance of Rails applications is looking at parts that impact Rails from outside of your application. In this talk, we'll look at the different ways Ruby loads code and how this impacts our applications. This talk will be more than you ever wanted to know about how Ruby loads files, and how we can speed it up.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Ghc6/"
