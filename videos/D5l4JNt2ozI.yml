description: "Command line interface tools are the new web framework. In addition to the\r\nPython standard library's getopt, optparse and argparse there is a bewildering\r\narray of packages available on the Python Packaging Index. Packages like Click,\r\nCliff, Docopt, Invoke all provide different mechanics for creating command line\r\napplications. When all you want to do is expose a command line and get back to\r\ncreating functionality, itâ€™s hard to know which alternative to reach for.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will have two parts, the first half will be a brief survey\r\nof popular modules. Strengths, weaknesses and design philosophies will be\r\ncompared by creating command line processing for the same example program.\r\n\r\nThe second half will go into more depth on a specific package, Begins. This\r\npackage was authored by the presenter to minimise the disruption developers\r\nexperience when breaking flow to implement command line processing. The\r\naudience will be shown how a single line of code can create a complex command\r\nline interface. It will also be shown how a handful of decorators from the\r\nBegins API can eliminate boilerplate code and create powerful, complex\r\napplications.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nAugust 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
