description: "Ruby is one of the best object-oriented languages around. Ubiquitous objects, duck-typing, mixins, expressive syntax with low ceremony, powerful reflection and metaprogramming. But Ruby has a mixed heritage that incorporates functional and procedural models along with OOP. This flexibility provides many options for how to solve problems, but it can also lead even experienced developers into a confusing mix of programming styles and hard-to-understand software designs. But what can we do to keep things simple and easy to understand? Alan Kay is often quoted as saying \"Perspective is worth 80 IQ points.\" So let's get the right perspective on Ruby and look at it from the direction of objects and OOP. This talk examines the fundamental concepts of object-orientation, and presents a simple model for how to think about objects and object-oriented programming. Why are objects so useful? What makes object-oriented programs easy to write and maintain? What are the pitfalls of not keeping to the OOP model? And how many slides can it take to explain two sentences? We'll answer all these questions and more!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGeF/"
