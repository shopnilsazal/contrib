description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #13\n29 April 2018\nSponsored by JP Morgan and Hosted by Google Campus\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nJ.P. Morgan has one of the largest Python codebases in the world. We will discuss the challenges of working with millions of lines of Python and how one can deal with those. We will also show you how Python makes it easy to achieve continuous delivery and ”push to production” approaches regardless of scale.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
