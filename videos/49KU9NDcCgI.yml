description: "In this talk Gus and Evan will discuss the recent Hot Lotto fraud scandal and how one MUSL employee, Eddie Tipton, was able to rig several state lotteries and win $17 million (or perhaps more). Gus' firm is actively supporting the prosecution in this case. Evan was responsible for identifying and analyzing how Eddie was able to rig the RNG.\n\nDetails on the rigged RNG and other details from the case will be presented publicly for the first time during this talk.\n\nFor historical context other related attacks including the Ron Harris and hacking keno in the 1990's and a recent incident involving a Russian hacking syndicate's exploitation of slot machines will also be discussed."
