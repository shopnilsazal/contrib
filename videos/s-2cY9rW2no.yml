recordingDate: 1502694900
description: 'In this talk I am going to demystify Quantum Computing. I will start with the absolute basics stemming from insights stemming from physics, in turn showing that they are as relevant to the power of quantum computing as they are for classical information processing. From there, I will go to describing the abstraction level not much different than the frameworks of the modern languages, harnessing all the new power to be harnessed if quantum computers are available in sizes, numbers and prices allowing Mooreâ€™s Law to continue beyond 2025. In the second part of the talk I will describe QUIL, the practical language allowing for effective use of quantum computing without paying attention to underlying spooky physics.'
