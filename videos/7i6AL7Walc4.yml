title: 'RubyConf 2014 - Isomorphic App Development with Ruby and Volt by Ryan Stout'
recordingDate: 1419267464
description: "As single page apps become common, more and more of our logic becomes duplicated between the front and back-end. We also spend more time writing API glue code to move data between each side. With isometric development you can remove the boilerplate of web development and the cognitive load of switching between languages.\n\nExisting isomorphic web frameworks run JavaScript on the server. Volt lets developers write their app code in ruby and have it run both in the browser and on the server. Data is automatically synchronized to remove the need for REST API development.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FrHD/"
