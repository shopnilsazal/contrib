description: "RubyConf 2017: Ten Unicode Characters You Should Know About as a Programmer by Jan Lelis\n\nThere are a lot of things that can go wrong when working with Unicode data. Some examples of unmeant behavior:\n\nYou try to downcase \"I\" to \"i\", but your Turkish friends want it to be a dotless \"ı\"\nYour UI is broken, because people use empty usernames, despite the String#blank? check\nYou think \"C\" is the same letter as \"С\", but your system does not think so and crashes\nUsing ten characters as representatives, I will highlight some Unicode characteristics which require a programmer's attention and demonstrate how Ruby's solid Unicode support can be of useful assistance!"
