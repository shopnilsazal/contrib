description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nJenkins X: Easy CI/CD for Kubernetes - James Strachan, CloudBees (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nThis talk will introduce you to a new open source project, Jenkins X, which is an open source CI / CD platform for Kubernetes based on Jenkins. After a short introduction James will spent most of the talk demonstrating how to develop applications with CI / CD on Kubernetes with Jenkins X: easily setup your own CI / CD system on your cloud of choice using standard tools: kubernetes, draft, helm, jenkins * quickly create new microservices or import existing projects with automated CI / CD  * use Pull Requests to trigger CI, Preview Environments, human approval then a full CD release * use automated provisioning to Preview, Testing, Staging & Production environments via helm charts and GitOps After this talk you should be able to develop cloud native apps at full speed with automated CI / CD in any language on any kubernetes cluster! Lest go faster!\n\nAbout James\nI work on CI + CD for Kubernetes with Jenkins for CloudBees. I'm the lead architect of Jenkins X. I also created the Groovy programming language, Apache Camel & was a founder of fabric8 & ActiveMQ. I've spoken at many conferences over the years (DevOxx, QCon, JavaOne, JFokus, ...) but never KubeCon!"
