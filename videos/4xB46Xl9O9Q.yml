title: 'GopherCon 2014 Writing High Performance Databases in Go by Ben Johnson'
recordingDate: 1400418302
description: "Databases have traditionally been the domain of C and C++ because of their need to squeeze every last clock cycle out of a system. But writing a whole database in C is not for the faint of heart. Luckily, we don't need to.\n\nIn this talk, I'll describe why I chose Go to write SkyDB, an open source behavioral analytics database, and some of the design choices that go into high performance Go code. We'll look at pure Go optimizations in stream processing and data access. We'll also look at integrating with cgo and external JIT tools to optimize the most performance critical code. And finally, we'll look at how to utilize Go to distribute processing across multiple cores and multiple machines.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0c/"
