description: "Lee Kushner & Mike Murray: Creating and Managing your Security Career\nCareers in information security are often difficult to navigate, with the industry changing more and more radically every year. We're going to talk about the important skills, traits and knowledge that a security pro needs, not just the usual stuff (like \"go get a CISSP\"), we're going to come from the perspective of two people who spend much of their time talking to hiring managers and companies looking for security stars, as well as talking to those same security stars about their careers, where they're going, what's working for them, and, most importantly, what's not. And we're going to use that information to teach you how to manage your own career to find the job that keeps you challenged, growing, happy and appropriately compensated.\n\nMike Murray: A 10-year veteran of the security industry, Mike Murray focuses his expertise on building strong security teams, and helping security professionals create successful and fulfilling careers. Dubbed \"Mr. Security Career\", his new book \"Forget the Parachute, Let Me Fly the Plane\" is targeted at careers in fast-moving industries.
