description: "Slides Here: https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-22/dc-22-presentations/Bugher/DEFCON-22-Grant-Bugher-Detecting-Bluetooth-Surveillance-Systems-Updated.pdf\n\nDetecting Bluetooth Surveillance Systems \nGrant Bugher PERIMETER GRID \nDepartments of Transportation around the United States have deployed \"little white boxes\" -- Bluetooth detectors used to monitor traffic speeds and activity. While they're supposedly anonymous, they detect a nearly-unique ID from every car, phone, and PC that passes by. In this presentation, I explore the documentation on these surveillance systems and their capabilities, then build a Bluetooth detector, analyzer, and spoofer with less than $200 of open-source hardware and software. Finally, I turn my own surveillance system on the DOT's and try to detect and map the detectors.\n\nGrant Bugher has been hacking since the early 90â€™s and working professionally in information security for the last 9 years. He is currently a security architect for a cloud computing provider, and has previously been a program manager and software engineer on a variety of widely-used developer tools and platforms. Grant is a prior speaker at BlackHat USA and a regular DefCon attendee since DefCon 16. Most of his research and work is on cloud compute and storage platforms, application security, and detecting attacks against web-scale applications.\n\nTwitter: @fishsupreme\n\nWeb: http://perimetergrid.com"
