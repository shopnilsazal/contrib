description: "By Arnab Deka\n\nWould you like to do some OCR using Ruby and learn some machine-learning along the way?\n\nIn this talk, first up, we'll have a quick demo where an attendee writes down a digit on a sticky note and a Ruby program tries to to recognize it. Then we'll pick it apart, covering:\n\nthe basics of machine-learning (and different applications)\nbrief look into the Math behind supervised learning (classification)\n(mostly) hand-rolled code applying this Math\nlibraries/tools available to Rubyists (and choice of Ruby platforms) including weka, mahout, libsvm, and the Ruby Matrix class :)\nways to dive deeper into ML"
