title: 'csync: Roaming Home Directories'
recordingDate: 1266146959
description: "by Andreas Schneider\r\nThis talk will be about a file synchronizer designed for the normal user. I will tell you how it and works and how you can use it to synchronize your music collection or set it up for Roaming Home Directories. \r\n\r\ncsync is a lightweight utility to synchronize files between two directories on a system or between multiple systems. \r\n\r\nIt synchronizes bidirectionally and allows the user to keep two copies of files and directories in sync. csync uses widely adopted protocols, such as smb or sftp, so that there is no need for a server component. It is a user-level program which means you don't need to be a superuser or administrator. \r\n\r\nTogether with a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM), the intent is to provide Roaming Home Directories for Linux. \r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nâ—¦http://www.csync.org/ \r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
