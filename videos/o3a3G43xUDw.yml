description: "by Liz Mattijsen\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nI will discuss some of the types of optimisations that I performed on theRakudo Perl 6 Core to make Rakudo Perl 6 about 3x faster in 2016 for manyapplications. How some optimisations became less necessary because ofoptimisations in MoarVM and/or nqp, but still made sense to do in the end. Howa lot of optimisations were just about cutting out unnecessary intermediatesteps that would make sense in any programming language. And how readabilityand elegance of the code suffered. No C code was involved, so basic Perlskills should be enough to follow this presentation.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 14:25:00"
