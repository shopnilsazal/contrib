description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nControllers: Lambda Functions for Extending your Infrastructure - Ross Guarino & Terin Stock, Cloudflare (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nThis session demonstrates how to leverage Kubernetes Controllers and Initializers as a framework for building transparent extensions of your Kubernetes cluster. Using a live coding exercise and demo, this presentation will showcase the possibilities of the basic programming paradigms the Kubernetes API server makes easy. As an SRE build custom integrations directly into the Kubernetes api that transparently enhance the developer experience. Ross Guarino will talk about how this pattern is used extensively at Cloudflare to provide a feature rich internal platform for our development team.\n\nAbout Ross\nRoss Guarino is a Systems Engineer at Cloudflare in charge of the technical direction of the internal platform. Heâ€™s determined to improve the lives of developers building and maintaining everything from a simple function to complex globally distributed systems.\n\nAbout Terin\nTerin is a long-time engineer at Cloudflare, currently working on building an internal Kubernetes cluster.
