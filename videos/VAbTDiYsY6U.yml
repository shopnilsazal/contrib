description: "James Robinson - Raspberry Pi Weather Station\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n[Education Summit]\n\nThe Raspberry Pi weather station project introduces young people to\nusing python programming to  solve real and technical problems. The\nweather station consists of a range of sensors including:\nAnemometer\nRain gauge\nWind Vane\nTemperature Probe\nBarometer\nAir Quality Sensor\nHygrometer\n\n1000 kits are being given away to schools to take part in the project\nby following our schemes of work which will involve.\nProgramming basic interrupt based sensors\nAdvanced Sensors using ADC chips\nCreate a pygame based UI\nLogging data to MySQL and Oracle Apex\nPresenting data to a web app\nDeploying the weather station\nIntegrating Apex database\n\nWe would love feedback on the project from Python Developers and\nsupport in updating some libraries from python 2 to 3."
