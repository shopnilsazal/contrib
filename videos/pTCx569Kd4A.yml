title: 'CNCF Webinar Series – Taking Serverless and AI to the Next Level'
recordingDate: 1519926104
description: "The two most trending technologies today are AI and serverless and surprisingly enough, they even go well together to enable agile and intelligent businesses. In this session, Yaron Haviv from iguazio and Tomer Rosenthal from Microsoft will provide an overview of serverless architectures and efforts to encourage collaboration and portability through CNCF working groups.\n\nYaron and Tomer will present new serverless platforms like nuclio which boost application performance and simplify the adoption of cloud native architectures across multiple cloud and edge locations. They will explain how serverless can accelerate AI from development to production and integrate local or cloud provider event triggers and data sources. Participants will learn how to flexibly test, deploy and auto-scale the same function codes in a public cloud like Azure, on an Edge appliance, or on a developer’s laptop.\n\nYaron and Tomer will demonstrate these technologies with cool AI use-cases such as sentiment analysis, image classification and predictive maintenance. They will then dive into how to build a fast AI serverless app on Azure with AKS, event-hub and ML/AI APIs, and how to deploy the same functions at the edge using open-source frameworks to address data gravity and latency. You will learn how functions are built from a simple ‘Hello World’ through real-time stream processing, deep-learning and multi-stage workflows and how to distribute or update AI models in online systems, all with no infrastructure setup and only minimal coding."
