description: "This session will show you how to wring the most from any hardware your app is installed on, so you can increase your reach and engagement. An introduction to state–of-the-art Android techniques and the importance of performance in an Android application will be introduced, and later we will slowly walk through the Android SDK tools regularly used to debug and profile Android applications, learn about some advanced topics such as building layouts, multithreading, networking, security and battery life ( one of the biggest bottleneck in applications).\nPerformant applications are one of the key drivers of success in the mobile world. Users may abandon an app if it runs slowly. Learning how to build applications that balance speed and performance with functionality and UX can be a challenge; however, it’s now more important than ever to get that balance right."
