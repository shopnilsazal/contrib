recordingDate: 1502983802
description: "Bridging the cross-device gap is probably the biggest challenge the ad-tech industry is facing today. Users spend more than 50% of their time on mobile devices, and it becomes crucial for advertiser to generate consistent message across all of the users' devices.\n\nCrosswise, the leading provider of big data consumer identification solutions, has developed a probabilistic model that manages to match users' devices. By collecting activity data for billions of devices, and applying state-of-the-art machine-learning technology, crosswise is building a usersâ€™ identification graph spanning millions of users across the US.\n\nCrosswise has developed a big-data analysis system capable of handling billions of activity points for billions of devices. The system matches the users activity signals across their devices, and is able to generate probabilistic matches with high confidence for millions of users.\n\n\nPyData Tel Aviv Meetup #6\n10 August 2017\nSponsored by Oracle\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
