description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nUsing kubectl to Run your End-to-End Tests - Amit Kumar Das & Uday Kiran, MayaData (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nEnd-to-end (e2e) tests are tasked to verify that a system with all its moving components (without mocks) can work together and satisfy the end user goals. Just as Kubernetes helps us with managing microservices based application containers, converting e2e tests into containers that can be versioned and orchestrated using Kubernetes helps us to test for functionality, performance benchmarking, upgrades and backward compatibility. Amit and Uday will demonstrate their e2e test containers for testing a storage infrastructure service added to Kubernetes that can be used on different platforms like GKE, OpenShift, etc., These e2e test containers can also be used by customers of the infrastructure service to augment their own CI/CD pipelines. The e2e tests have moved from being scripts to Kubernetes YAML files that are used by service providers and the customers.\n\n\"About Amit\nAmit is a strong open source advocate and a firm believer of `taco bell programming` that helps him building simple & easy to use software. When he is not into programming, you will find him understanding the world from his daughter's perspective. Amit is the maintainer & core contributor to OpenEBS.\n\nAbout Uday\nUday has been a Kubernetes user for almost 2 Years now. This will be his first talk at a KubeCon Event. Uday has been part of various Kubernetes and GoLang meetups. Uday also conducts Kubernetes trainings for interested users . Uday is an avid programmer and hacker, he is currently responsible for providing various strategies for managing CI/CD for his organization and has been actively involved in open source project OpenEBS."
