title: 'Alterconf Portland 2015 - Your Job Is Political by Kelsey Gilmore-Innis'
recordingDate: 1442506708
description: "Working as a developer has never been \"just about writing code.\" A new generation of activists are doing amazing work questioning who is allowed & encouraged to work in tech and how power structures are established and maintained in our field. As much as the personal is political, the old-fashioned political still is too, and companies and individuals made rich by the tech industry have been making increasingly direct monetary incursions into politics. Let's take a look at what policies & politicians our bosses, investors & clients are buying at the local and state levels. The goal isn't to shame anyone or make any calls to action but to deepen our understanding of what ways the money our labor generates for other people is going towards changing education, democracy, policing, and more.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HG6Q/"
