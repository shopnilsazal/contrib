description: "As Ruby continues to mature as a language, its use in large scale (enterprise!) codebases is expanding - and the need to integrate into larger architectures is already here. It is tempting to build networks of APIs in order to integrate applications, but there is an answer - messaging. This talk will reveal the benefits of messaging, and describe patterns that can be implemented at any level - from workers on single applications, to integrating separate codebases, all the way up to massive, concurrent service-oriented architectures that rely on messaging as the backbone. Prepare to be assaulted with an inspiring way to integrate and scale - and leave armed with the tools required to do so.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GZCZ/"
