title: 'Building Asynchronous Communication Layer w XMPP, Ruby, Javascript by Andrew Carter and Steve Jang'
recordingDate: 1340224526
description: "Although XMPP is most often used as a chat protocol, it can also provide a robust asynchronous communication channel in other application scenarios. In this presentation, we will provide introduction to Strophe.js, XMPP4R, and ejabberd, which are the XMPP components that we use to integrate our device automation framework and living room devices under test. By using these off-the-shelf components, we addressed our needs for getting around internal firewalls, application security (based on SASL), and asynchronous command-response handling.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGjB/"
