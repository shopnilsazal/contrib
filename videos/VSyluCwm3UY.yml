description: "Context for People of Color by Juwan Platt\n\nWhy is there such a lack of interest in STEM related fields in regards to people of color? As Juwan Platt says, they lack the contextual knowledge of why this stuff matters â€” and we as a community must inform them. A community guy himself, Juwan Platt encourages kids of color to take control of their future and dive into STEM related fields."
