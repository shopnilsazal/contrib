For the last 5 years he's been Recruitment Manager in 7N, a Danish top contracting agency for experienced IT professionals. He's recruited for more than 100 companies and has seen (and quite often improved) careers of hundreds of programmers. He's interested in the impact of non-technical skills on work satisfaction and career progress of IT experts. He's got PhD in sociology, writes a recruitment blog rekrutacyjny.blogspot.com\n\n\nWhy it pays to know AngularJS?\nIn my brief speech I'll try to look at AngularJS from the perspective of professional opportunities:\nHow popular is AngularJS in companies and among developers?\nWhat are your job prospects once you know AngularJS?\nWhy being up-to-date is not only about knowing this or that framework?"
