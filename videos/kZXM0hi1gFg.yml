description: "In this episode of GALs, filmed at the Microsoft Reactor space in San Francisco, Christina interviews Rita Zhang, a principal software engineer in CSE at Microsoft. Rita had just come off a technical presentation about using TensorFlow, Kubernetes, and Azure together, which led to an interesting conversation about open source at Microsoft and what surprised her about the company.\n\n\"Everytime I show up at a hack fest or a meetup with my MacBook, it helps build credibility to show that we're in this just as much as our customers,\"\n\nRita also shares what got her interested in technology and her progression as an engineer and the importance of having good mentors.\n\nYou can (and should!) follow Rita on Twitter @ritazzhang http://www.twitter.com/ritazzhang"
