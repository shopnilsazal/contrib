recordingDate: 1419619410
description: "By, Betsy Haibel\n\nRuby's full of nice little metaprogramming tricks. Learning a new one's always the same cycle: 1. scared & tentative; 2. drunk on power; 3. woefully repentant; 4. mature & reasonable. Using my own history (of poor choices), I'll take you through stages 1-4 for: mazes of twisty little send calls, all alike! replacing def with method_missing! hook method indirection \"magic!\" Ill-timed define_methods! Sure, you could skip to the end - stage 4 is mostly \"obey SRP; extract service objects\" and \"anonymous module inclusion's your BFF\" - but getting there is half the point and all the fun.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FsXV/"
