description: "By, John Duff\nOver 10 years ago the first line of code was written for what would become Shopify. Within this codebase we can see the evolution of Rails from the early 0.13.1 days to where we are today, on Rails 4.1. Through the history of this git repo we can revisit some of the significant changes to Rails over the years, and simultaneously observe what has withstood the test of time. By looking at the challenges that we have overcome while building and using Rails, we can inform future decisions so that we can continue to build a framework, and applications, that last years to come.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/G6rD/"
