description: "\"Project Cauã\", by Jon \"maddog\" Hall, Linux International and Project Cauã\r\n\r\nProject Cauã is an open source software and hardware project to create millions of new high-tech jobs in Brazil and millions more in the rest of Latin America. Project Cauã will also cut electricity usage, make computers easier to use, allow for the creation of gratis wireless support over large urban areas, and provide a low-cost or gratis super-computing grid. All of the work will be freely available, and parts of Project Cauã may be useful in high-density areas such as Manhattan, Chicago, Detroit, or Beijing. World peace comes next year."
