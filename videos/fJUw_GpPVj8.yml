description: "DEF CON 16 - James Shewmaker: StegoFS\nThis talk will reintroduce classic steganographic techniques to use with serializing, watermarking, or stashing your data in the latest Internet meme. Why not let everyone who is forwarding yet another painful nut-shot AFHV clip store your data for you? We will create a simple filesystem that is robust enough to survive conversion, and building a structure to organize the data, focusing on indirection and fault tolerance.\n\nJim has over 15 years experience in IT, primarily developing appliances for automation and security for broadcast radio, Internet, and satellite devices. He is one of the first GIAC Platinum certified Malware (GSM) experts and a SANS Institute Instructor. Jim's primary focus areas are investigations, penetration testing, and analysis. He is actively contributing to SANS courseware and occasional FreeBSD port contributor. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
