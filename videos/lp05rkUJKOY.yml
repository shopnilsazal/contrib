description: "Keynote: The Kubernetes Application Registry: Easily Deploying Complex Applications with CoreOS Quay - Brandon Philips, CTO, CoreOS\n\nCoreOS has extended its container image registry, Quay, so that it can manage and store complete Kubernetes applications, which are composed of images along with configuration files. Quay now delivers a first-of-its-kind Kubernetes Application Registry that with this release is also integrated with Kubernetes Helm so that deployment of an application can be completely automated.\n\nOver the past few months, the Quay team has been laying the foundation for the first Kubernetes Application Registry. On the server side, we’ve added an experimental registry API to Quay and a minimal UI enabling the storage, discovery, and management of complete applications. On the client side, we’ve created a registry plugin for Helm, the Kubernetes package manager, that brings all of these features to the ecosystem of Helm applications, known as Charts. One of the most interesting new features introduced to both Quay and Helm is the concept of customizable release channels, much like how CoreOS ships Alpha, Beta, and Stable channels for Container Linux releases. All of this is done through a community-driven API specification, called App Registry, that enables Kubernetes ecosystem to develop more sophisticated tools and more reliable deployment pipelines. This ultimately delivers a Kubernetes Application Registry.\n\nJoin Brandon Philips to learn about CoreOS Quay and how it works to store containers and applications for Kubernetes, and get involved.\n\nAbout Brandon Philips\nBrandon Philips is helping to build modern Linux server infrastructure at CoreOS as CTO. Prior to CoreOS, he worked at Rackspace hacking on cloud monitoring and was a Linux kernel developer at SUSE. As a graduate of Oregon State's Open Source Lab he is passionate about open source technologies."
