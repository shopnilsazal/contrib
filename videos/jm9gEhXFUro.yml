description: "RubyConf 2016 - Ruby, Red Pandas, and You by Sean Marcia\n\nRed pandas are adorable, playful, curious, and super cute. Unfortunately, they are in serious trouble. Over 50% of red panda newborns born in captivity do not survive long enough to leave their den and no one knows why. Come find out why red pandas are so amazing, how I met a Smithsonian Zoo researcher studying this and how weâ€™re solving this important problem using Ruby and machine learning. You will also leave this talk knowing how you can get involved (no matter your skill level) with great projects like this."
