description: "Bruce Potter, Beetle, CowboyM, Dan Moniz, Rodney Thayer, 3ricj, Pablos all speaking on behalf of the Shmoo Group\n\nLast Summer, they dared to make a Wi-Fi sniper rifle that fried their eyeballs and scared the crap out of UPS. They built a robot that owned your Mom's access point and showed you the password to her underwear drawer, too. Last Winter, they ran up a $3000 bar tab at a nightclub in D.C. with several hundred ShmooCon attendees—then donated just as much to EFF for shits and grins. This DefCon, the Shmoo Group brings you a slew of hacker goo, goofs, and gear to go with your shiny new \"Notice to Law Enforcement\" stickers. Can you resist? Probably. Will you? Nope. Why? Because they have cool shit all over again. IDN fallout and homograph attacks on personal identities thanks to 3ricj. Hot models wearing spy actionwear designed by Pablos—fresh from his ninja lair of alien technology. Revving up rainbow tables with Dan \"Don't Be Crazy\" Moniz. New Wi-Fi kung-fu with \"Rogue Squadron\" and EAP-peeking by Beetle. Rodney Thayer explains how to blow $1 MILLION on commercial security shtuff and still get owned by a grade-school punk addicted to Xbox. CowboyM returns to show off new geeky tactical gear designed for close-quarters wireless combat—do NOT try this at home, kids, and certainly not inside a Faraday cage. Finally, because you've all been waiting for it, Bruce Potter pours gasoline on his security model self and lights a fucking match! Mo' better and with no blow-up dolls, the Shmoo Group returns to rant on recent projects and review new ones. Rated R for strong violence, adult situations, disturbing images, nudity, language, and epic warfare.\n\nThe Shmoo Group is a non-profit think-tank comprised of security professionals from around the world who donate their free time and energy to information security research and development. They get a kick out of sharing their ideas, code, and stickers at DefCon. Whether it's mercenary hacking for CTF teams, lock-picking, war-flying, or excessive drinking, TSG has become a friendly DefCon staple in recent years past. Visit www.shmoo.com for more info."
