Arrays in JavaScript implement map and are therefore functors. Promises, Streams and Trees often implement map in functional languages, and when they do, they are considered functors. The map method of the functor takes itâ€™s own contents and transforms each of them using the transformation callback passed to map, and returns a new functor, which contains the structure as the first functor, but with the transformed values.\n\nPrevious video on functors\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLIH8TKbAh4\n\nMap\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCqtb-Z5YGQ\n\nPromises\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d7s3spWAzo\n\nGreat functional person\nhttps://twitter.com/drboolean\n\n\"What is a Functor?\" by Tikhon Jelvis\nhttps://www.quora.com/Functional-Programming/What-is-a-functor-1/answer/Tikhon-Jelvis?share=1\n\nBest place to learn Haskell\nhttp://learnyouahaskell.com/\n\nFull script here\nhttps://medium.com/@mpjme/5f794a1ca246"
