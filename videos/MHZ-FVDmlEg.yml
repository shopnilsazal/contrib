description: "OSFeels 2016 - Standing Desks and Free Pizza: Body Image Negotiations in Tech Spaces by Christine Bryant-Ryback\n\nTech is notoriously bad at talking about intersections of class, disability, race, genderâ€“health, weight, and embodiment are equally nuanced subjects all on their own. What happens when a self-consciously desk-oriented culture tries to over-correct? What happens when people tire of beer and pizza that no longer feels optional, and \"clean eating\" is the cleanest way out? What happens to those who are already hyper-aware that their bodies are battlegrounds? How do we find some socially-acceptable balance in these interwoven networks of expectation and self-care?\n\nThis talk will explore the complex landscape of body image negotiation in tech-specific cultural spaces, and hopefully offer a couple of tools to enable a baseline level of body-positive communication with tech co-workers.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/UkSv/"
