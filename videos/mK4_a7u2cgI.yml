description: "React & Flux  by: Christian Lilley\n\ncertain: the 'Virtual DOM' approach is the future of the web. It's just too fast and too sensible to ignore. In this session, we'll learn:\n\nWhat 'Virtual DOM' is and why it matters\nHow you can begin making use of it now, in your existing environments\nHow React also thinks differently about data-binding, with its \"one-way reactive data flow\"\nLonger-Term, React combined with the 'Flux' pattern points the way to a very different style of front-end application development than we're used to now: very modular, 'component'-driven architectures. At the same time, one of the signal traits of React/Flux is that more and more of the application is contained exclusively in Javascript files: React's HTML elements are declared as either \"JSX\" templates, or just as Javascript objects. And some folks are taking this on to the next level, even programming all of their CSS in JS as well! Before this session is over, you'll see how all these pieces fit together and how you can build some very effective, very fast, and very maintainable components and apps this way. That said, we'll also discuss what's still missing from the React/Flux ecosystem, and provide you with a roadmap that allows you decide when you can - and when you can't - build your whole application around it.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Gtla/"
