description: "http://www.slideshare.net/PyData/high-performance-python-landscape-ian-ozsvald\n\nA Python programmer has many options to profile and optimize CPU-bound and data-bound systems, common solutions include Cython, numpy and PyPy. Increasingly we have single-core solutions that should take advantage of many cores and clusters. This talk reviews the current state of the art, looking at the compromises and outcomes of the current approaches and reviews upcoming solutions like Numba, Pythran and PyPy's numpy. Thoughts will be shared on how current hindrances might be improved."
