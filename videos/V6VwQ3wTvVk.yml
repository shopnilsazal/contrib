description: "The announcement that sun.misc.Unsafe will disappear in Java 9 created a huge buzz in the community and lots of people didnÂ’t agree with the idea. While Unsafe have to go away eventually the time in not yet and Oracle finally agreed on that.\n\nTo replace sun.misc.Unsafe we need a clear set of APIs to achieve the same behavior and performance. VarHandle, Foreign Function Calls, Generic Specialization (Templates) and other proposals try to solve this misery and to replace certain aspects of our beloved class.\n\nThis talk will introduce the alternatives and explain how and why they will help to replace sun.misc.Unsafe. It uses basic examples to demonstrate what a Post-Apocalyptic Unsafe World will look like."
