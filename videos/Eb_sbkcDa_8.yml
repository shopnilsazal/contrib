description: "Web Rebels is coming back in 2019 https://webrebels.org\n\nPatricia Aas is a C++ programmer working on the Vivaldi Browser. She has previously worked at Opera Software on their Desktop Browser and at Cisco on their Telepresence Hardware Endpoints, primarily on Linux. Patricia is a curious person, always trying to find out how things work. She hopes that we will find a way to make the world a better place by creating things that can be used for good.\n\nReading other peoples code\nSomeone else's code. Even worse, thousands of lines, maybe hundreds of files of other peoples code. Is there a way to methodically read and understand other peoples work, build their mental models? In this talk I will go through techniques I have developed throughout 18 years of programming. Hopefully you will walk away with a plan on how to approach a new code base. But even more I hope you walk away with a feeling of curiosity, wanting to get to know your fellow programmers through their code."
