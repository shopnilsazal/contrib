description: 'Creating robots and programming them with JavaScript has never been easier, with the release of open source libraries to help you do so. Whatâ€™s bubbling under the surface of these enormously expressive libraries, though? Discover with me a deep world of many layers all working together in order to line up bits, bytes and electrical current. Expect an accessible story-driven exploration, which will open up new ways to appreciate the primitive workings of computers with language as literature.'
