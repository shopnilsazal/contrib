description: "Johnny Long, Death of a Thousand cuts - Forensics\n\nIn this day and age, forensics evidence lurks everywhere. This talk takes attendees on a brisk walk through the modern technological landscape in search of hidden digital data. Some hiding places are more obvious than others, but far too many devices are overlooked in a modern forensics investigation. As we touch on each device, we'll talk about the possibilities for the forensic investigator, and take a surprising and fun look at the nooks and crannies of many devices considered commonplace in today's society. We'll look at iPods (and other MP3 players), Sony PSP devices (and other personal video products), digital cameras, printers, fax machines, all-in-one devices, dumb phones, \"smart\" phones, cell phones, various network devices and even wristwatches, sunglasses, pens and all sorts of other devices that contain potential evidence. For each device, we'll look at what can be hidden and talk about various detection and extraction techniques, avoiding at all costs the obvious \"oh I knew that\" path of forensics investigation. All this will of course be tempered with Johnny's usual flair, some fun \"where's the evidence\" games, and some really cool giveaways.\n\nAre you a fan of the Stealing the Network series? If so, you'll especially enjoy this talk, which puts you inside the mind of the agents tailing Knuth in book three of the Series: Stealing the Network: How to Own an Identity. This talk will give you an inside look into the problems associated with catching an ultra-paranoid bad guy, and provides a great preview to the book on this, the opening weekend. Wondering who the heck Knuth is? No worries. Skip this talk. Uber-agent might provide it first hand when he breaks down your door!\n\nJohnny Long is a \"clean-living\" family guy who just so happens to like hacking stuff. Over the past two years, Johnny's most visible focus has been on this Google hacking \"thing\" which has served as yet another diversion to a serious (and bill-paying) job as a professional hacker and security researcher for Computer Sciences Corporation. In his spare time, Johnny enjoys making random pirate noises (\"Yarrrrr!\"), spending time with his wife and kids, convincing others that acting like a kid is part of his job as a parent, feigning artistic ability with programs like Bryce and Photoshop, pushing all the pretty shiny buttons on them new-fangled Mac computers, and making much-too-serious security types either look at him funny or start laughing uncontrollably. Johnny has written or contributed to several books, including \"Google Hacking for Penetration Testers\" from Syngress Publishing, which has secured rave reviews and has lots of pictures"
