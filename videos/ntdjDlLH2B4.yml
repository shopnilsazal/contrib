description: "PyData NYC 2014\nOver the past five years the drop in DNA sequencing costs has quickly transformed our ability to understand the genome. In this tutorial, we will introduce you to pyPLINK/SEQ, a toolset for working with human genetic variation data, in different ways, as: a library for accessing genomic information, connecting to reference databases, and applying statistical models; and as a library for interpreting your own genomes. We will explore the speaker's genome and give a thorough presentation of pyPLINK/SEQ functionalities. All contents of the talk will be supplemented with code available on GitHub."
