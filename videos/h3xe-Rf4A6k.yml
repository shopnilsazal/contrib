description: "RailsConf 2018: Here’s to the crazy ones by James Adam\n\nHave you ever had a crazy idea that you were quietly convinced was great, but that everyone else thought was dumb? Well guess what: the future of Rails is depending on you.\n\nI’d like rewind time by more than ten years, to tell you about one particular crazy idea that almost everyone hated, until it quietly became one of the core architectural components of Rails.\n\nAt the same time, we’ll meet the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels and the trouble makers that ended up shaping Rails as we know it… and maybe, just maybe, we will realise that we can be one of them too."
