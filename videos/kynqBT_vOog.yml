description: "Do you want to build backend applications using\_Swift\_but don't want to manage computing infrastructure to run those applications in the cloud? Enter\_serverless\_cloud platforms…\n\_\nThese services allow developers to push code, rather than VMs, into the cloud. The platforms allow you to connect external event sources like API requests or message queues to functions in your code. As events occur, your code is instantiated and executed to process each request. Developers are only billed for the milliseconds needed to process each request.\n\_\nIn this session, developers will learn how to build\_Swift\_microservices using modern “serverless” cloud platforms. We’ll look at common challenges (and solutions) to building applications using “serverless” stacks. Exploring emerging “serverless” design patterns will give developers the knowledge to build application architectures using these new platforms."
