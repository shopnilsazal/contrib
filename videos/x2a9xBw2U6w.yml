description: "Droidcon Paris 2014\nMario Viviani, Mariuxx Apps\n\nWith the addition of Android Wear to the Android ecosystem, the \"wearables era\" is officially opened. Android apps can now extend beyond the limits of smartphone and tablets, providing to the user a new kind of interaction where \"less is more\" and opening new ways for developers to engage users within their apps.\nHowever, the approach to Wear development is slightly different from handheld Android coding, and different are also the types of applications developers can design, develop and distribute for Wear devices.\nIn this talk you will discover how to easily setup and include Android Wear features within your Android App in just a few minutes, an overview of Android Studio tools for Wear development, what are the best practices of Wear APIs you should keep in mind and what are the main difference between \"classic\" Android handheld development and Wear."
