description: "Is Net Neutrality on the up or down? Is DRM rising or falling? Is crypto being banned, or will it win, and if it does, will its major application be ransomware or revolution? Is the arc of history bending toward justice, or snapping abruptly and plummeting toward barbarism?\n\nIt's complicated.\n\nA better world isn't a product, it's a process. The right question isn't, \"Does the internet make us better or worse,\" its: \"HOW DO WE MAKE AN INTERNET THAT MAKES THE WORLD BETTER?\" We make the world better with code, sure, but also with conversations, with businesses, with lawsuits and with laws.\n\nWe don't know how to get to a better world, but we know which direction it's in, and we know how to hill-climb towards it. If we keep heading that way, we'll get *somewhere*. Somewhere good. Somewhere imperfect. Somewhere where improvement is possible."
