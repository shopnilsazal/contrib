title: 'Rocky Mountain Ruby 2014 - The Technical Debt Trap by Doc Norton'
recordingDate: 1414038006
description: "Technical Debt has become a catch-all phrase for any code that needs to be re-worked. Much like Refactoring has become a catch-all phrase for any activity that involves changing code. These fundamental misunderstandings and comfortable yet mis-applied metaphors have resulted in a plethora of poor decisions. What is technical debt? What is not technical debt? Why should we care? What is the cost of misunderstanding? What do we do about it? Doc discusses the origins of the metaphor, what it means today, and how we properly identify and manage technical debt.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/F1kN/"
