recordingDate: 1431021196
description: "By, Jim Jones\nFor dynamic apps, Rails has taken a backseat to client side frameworks such as AngularJS, Ember and Backbone.\n\nLearn how to use server side javascript effectively to greatly simplify your code base and reuse your view logic. We'll implement parallel apps with vanilla Rails js responses, AngularJS and Ember.js so that we can contrast the implementations and evaluate the tradeoffs."
