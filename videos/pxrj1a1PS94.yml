title: 'Let''s make the web faster - tips from trenches @ Google by Ilya Grigorick'
recordingDate: 1336088100
description: "Google loves speed, and we want to make the entire web faster - yes, that includes your Rails app! We'll explore what we've learned from running our own services at scale, as well as cover the research, projects, and open sourced tools we've developed in the process.\n\nWe'll start at the top with website optimization best practices, take a look at what the browser and HTML5 can do for us, take a detour into the optimizations for the mobile web, and finally dive deep into the SPDY and TCP protocol optimizations.\n\nWe'll cover a lot of ground, so bring a coffee. By the end of the session, you should have a good checklist to help you optimize your own site."
