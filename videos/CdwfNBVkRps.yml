description: "Robert Treat, OmniTI\n\nThis talk discusses techniques and philosophy for making oncall more humane / reasonable. We will discuss terminology, how to sort through \"alert overload,\" suggestions for tooling to help, and processes you can put in place to get development & management on board. This comes from years of taking over a managing various oncall services for different architectures, often from extreme states of disrepair."
