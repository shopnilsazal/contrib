recordingDate: 1473520860
description: 'Seems that everywhere you look now large scale, bleeding edge cloud technology projects are being written in the Go Programming Language including many of the the current wave of ''Cloud Native'' applications and services such as Kubernetes (Container management and orchestration) and Prometheus (systems and service monitoring). In this talk we''ll look into why Go is fast becoming the "Cloud Programming Language" and show you how you can apply the lessons learned on these Open Source projects to building your own Cloud Native apps including deep dives and demos around containerization, deployment and scalability.'
