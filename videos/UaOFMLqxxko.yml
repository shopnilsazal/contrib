recordingDate: 1383938889
description: "Elie Bursztein & Panel - Bad Memories\nNo matter which kind of cryptography you are using to defend your network, , sooner or later to make it work you will have to store somewhere a password, a key or a certificate. If the attacker is able to tampers with its storage mechanism then even the strongest encryption mechanism became irrelevant.\n\nIn this talk we will present Tapjacking attacks which abuse smartphone features to create more efficient clickjacking attacks. We also show how to attack storage mechanisms to tampers with SSL session and break into Wifi network that use WPA encryption.\n\nFor SSL we will show how to exploit warning inconsistency and caching mechanisms to trick the user into accepting a bad cert and gets his credential stolen.\n\nFor Wifi network we will demonstrate how to use clickjacking, CSRF, and XSS to steal from routers the two pieces of information that an attacker needs to geo-localize and break into it, namely the WPA key and the mac address. Finally we will discuss how to discuss what frame busting defense are used by the Alexa top 100 website and how we were able to break them using standard and not so standard tricks. We also demonstrate how to use Paul Stone scrolling attack in novel ways.\n\nThis is joint work with Dan Boneh and Collin Jackson.\n\nElie Bursztein is a researcher at the Stanford Computer Security Lab. He holds a PhD in computer science and an Engineering degree in computer systems, networks and security. His research focus is offensive technologies, mobile and web security. He enjoy applying game theory, machine learning and data mining techniques to security.\n\nBaptiste Gourdin is a student at the Stanford Computer Security Lab focusing on web and mobile devices security. He holds an Engineering in computer systems, networks and security.\n\nGustav Rydstedt is a student at the Stanford Computer Security Lab focusing on web and mobile devices security.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
