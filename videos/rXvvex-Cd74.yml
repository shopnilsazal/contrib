title: 'DEF CON 18 - Joe Damato - Function Hooking for Mac OSX and Linux'
recordingDate: 1383934964
description: "Joe Damato - Function Hooking for Mac OSX and Linux\nThis talk will cover three different methods of function hooking for Mac OSX and Linux. The talk will begin by describing useful bits of Intel64 assembly followed up with 3 different binary rewriting techniques to hook a range of different functions, including some inlined functions, too. We'll finish up with a demo of two nice things that these techniques make possible (a memory profiler and a function call tracer), and one slightly more evil thing.\n\nJoe Damato is a systems programmer who spends his days hacking on the Ruby VM and tools for analyzing the performance characteristics of complex software systems. He maintains a blog (http://timetobleed.com) where he releases code, patches to the Ruby VM, and his thoughts on low level systems programming. He maintains memprof, a Ruby level memory profiler and added support for libdl to trace.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
