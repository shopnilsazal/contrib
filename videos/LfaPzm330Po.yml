description: "Ramon Gomez - Bulletproofing The Cloud: Are We Any Closer To Security?\n\nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-19/dc-19-presentations/Gomez/DEFCON-19-Gomez-Bulletproofing-The-Cloud.pdf\n\nCloud security has come into focus in the last few years; while many ways to break the cloud have been proposed, few solutions have been put forward. This talk is primarily a conceptual discussion on how cloud providers can and should be (but probably are not) protecting both their own and their clients' assets in their cloud implementations. It will discuss the known issues with cloud, and a readily available proposed solution to some of these issues. The presentation will conclude with a demonstration of an actual implementation of this theory at a cloud hosting provider. An understanding of basic network security technology is required.\n\nRamon Gomez is a Security Professional working for a cloud hosting provider. He has been working in correlation theory for the last 8 years, including time spent working at a prominent North American vendor of SEIM software, providing theory and logic to improve the correlation capabilities of the product. His primary areas of professional expertise are in correlation theory, and Intrusion Detection/Analysis."
