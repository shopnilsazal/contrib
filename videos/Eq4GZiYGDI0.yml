description: "Architecture of Cloud Native: Open Source Projects Powering Pluggable Infrastructure\n\nCoreOS is building the components needed for a cloud native architecture. Cloud native applications require the strength of trustworthy infrastructure developed and supported by a thriving community. Independently useful, pluggable pieces of infrastructure allow for the flexibility to move applications in a multi-cloud environment, from cloud to data center. \n\nIn a deep dive into the open source projects that are pushing cloud native infrastructure forward from the container formats, container engines, and clustering software, this talk will share how various pieces developed by CoreOS can help to run a cloud native application."
