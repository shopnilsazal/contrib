recordingDate: 1528976949
description: "As drones start buzzing above our heads, our future is fuzzing. The increasing use of autonomous drones is both exciting and frightening. The success and acceptability of such devices will depend on how well they will be able to communicate with people. How will people be able to make sense of a droneâ€™s intentions and abilities? How will drones respond to people in complex situations? At the intersection between technology and design, I will discuss various techniques and methodologies to prototype and test human-drone interaction. In particular, you will learn how drones can be thought of as companions with emotions that people would even want to pet.\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018. For more information, check reaktorbreakpoint.com.\n\n---\n\nJessica Cauchard\nHuman-Computer Interaction Researcher\n\nJessica Cauchard investigates novel human-machine interaction, particularly human-drone interactions and natural interfaces. Currently she focuses on building methods and early stage prototypes for interacting with devices of the future."
