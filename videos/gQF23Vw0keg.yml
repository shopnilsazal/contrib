description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nEnvoy Internals Deep Dive - Matt Klein, Lyft (Advanced Skill Level)\n\nEnvoy (https://www.envoyproxy.io/) is a high performance L4/L7 network proxy with a pluggable filter chain model; this allows Envoy to be used for a variety of different scenarios, including HTTP/2, gRPC, MongoDB, and Redis. Envoy provides advanced load balancing support, including eventually consistent service discovery, circuit breakers, retries, rate limiting, and zone-aware load balancing. Envoy also has best-in-class observability, using statistics, logging, and distributed tracing. Since becoming OSS in 2016, Envoy has gained substantial traction in both \"service mesh\" and edge (API gateway) deployments. In this talk, Matt Klein will dive deep into Envoy internals from a systems perspective, covering threading model, stats, hot restart, the xDS APIs, and other core concepts. This is an advanced talk and prior knowledge of what Envoy is at a high level is assumed.\n\nAbout Matt\nMatt Klein is a software engineer at Lyft and the architect of Envoy. Matt has been working on operating systems, virtualization, distributed systems, networking, and making systems easy to operate for over 15 years across a variety of companies. Some highlights include leading the development of Twitter’s C++ L7 edge proxy and working on high-performance computing and networking in Amazon’s EC2."
