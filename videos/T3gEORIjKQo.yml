description: "RailsConf 2017: It's Dangerous to go Alone: Building Teams like an Organizer by Colin Fleming\n\nLeading an open source or community project means dealing with people challenges in addition to technical challenges -- how do we take a scattering of interested people and build a team with them? Turns out, we can adapt a bunch of practices we already use! Using a collaboration between a nonprofit and a civic group as a case study, we'll talk about ways to apply best practices from community organizers to our work. In particular, we'll talk about similarities between contemporary organizing and agile models, ways to build relationships with other team members, and making our work more sustainable."
