description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2017 by Benjamin Monjoie, Appkers.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-49\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/bmonjoie/opengl-a-noobs-guide-for-android-developers\n\nOpenGL is often regarded as too complex, obscur or even too low level to be considered when developing an application. Most people will even try to go around it and develop what they want using Views and Canvas to avoid developing with it. Nevertheless, it's not always possible nor the best solution. As someone who have been going through all the learning of OpenGL recently, I have encountered a lot of frustration but also a lot of “aha!“ moment. In this talk, I will try to demystified OpenGL and share the basics of what it is and how to use it in Android to make applications perform better. Also, I will share all the pitfalls and key concepts that you should know when starting with OpenGL.\n\nType: Android development\nExperience: beginner\n\nAlex Karp Production"
