description: "Muse is a Ruby domain-specific language for creating digital music. I will talk on how Muse can be used to create digital music through a simple analog software synthesizer, either transcribed from existing music scores, or algorithmically created out of data from various sources. Existing Ruby libraries to generate digital music mostly generate MIDI files that require you to run it through a synthesizer to produce the actual sound files. Muse actually generates sound files from the first principle and I will show you how I did it.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8W/"
