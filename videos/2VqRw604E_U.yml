description: "Talking at GDC 2015, Firaxis' David McDonough & Will Miller explain what happened when they were asked to take Civ from its traditional, historical setting into a possible future for humanity on an alien planet. The primary design challenge was to maintain the essential elements of Civ which account for its popularity and high engagement, and apply them to a new setting in an unknown future - and it's discussed in this in-depth postmortem.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
