description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\nFriday, September 19 • 9:30am - 10:15am\n\nBringing a Machete to the Amazon\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is billed as an amazingly secure and resilient cloud services provider, but what is the reality once you look past that pristine environment and the manicured forests give way to dark jungle as you start to migrate existing applications to the AWS Cloud or design new ones for AWS exclusively?\n\nWith concrete examples and new techniques this presentation will explore “full stack” vulnerabilities and their effect on security and how they create new pitfalls when migrating to and operating in an AWS world. From the simple (checking in your AWS credentials to github or embedding them in your app) the unexpected (XXE injection to expose AWS metadata), to the unintended (data leakage and service exposure to other AWS customers and 3rd party cloud management services). Many examples will be shared along side new techniques showing how easy it is to expose your applications and infrastructure to attack through misunderstanding, ignorance or bad actors.\n\nTo address these challenges this presentation will also reveal and demonstrate a free tool we have designed to assess full stack AWS applications, map out the interactions between infrastructure and code and help individuals and organizations get clarity and bring a machete to the Amazon Cloud.\n\n\nSpeaker\n\nErik Peterson\nDirector of Technology Strategy, Veracode\nErik Peterson is the Director of Technology Strategy for Veracode with 17 years of security industry experience, including senior leadership and technology roles for HP, SPI Dynamics, GuardedNet and Sanctum.
