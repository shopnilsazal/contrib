recordingDate: 1417093571
description: "You are a developer and dream about scaling your application like Snapchat? You need latest support for Java 8, Servlet 3.1, WebSockets, optimized annotation processing, Gradle, Maven, Jenkins pipeline and Android clients? Well, we have it all with Managed VMs. The session will introduce you to the latest Cloud SDK, a multi language environment (Java, Node.js, Dart, yours…), all sharing the same APIs and Services for developing Docker images and containers that can run locally and which can be deployed unchanged to the Google Cloud in a fully managed environment.\n\nPrésentation par Ludovic Champenois"
