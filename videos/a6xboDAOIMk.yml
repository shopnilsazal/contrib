description: "Reworking Your Team for Kubernetes [B] - Hans Kieserman, Yahoo\n\nLaunching a product on Kubernetes involves a lot more than just “containerization”. It’s an interesting challenge to train team members for expertise in networking, monitoring, debugging, and reworking legacy apps to perform better under orchestration. Beyond the common issues of optimizing Docker containers, you’ll need a whole new understanding in order to create the right team, schedule, and ambitious but realistic adoption path.\nWe can help your efforts towards adoption by explaining common problems with getting up to speed. With several Kubernetes projects in the works across multiple teams, Yahoo has recent experience that can benefit any company.\n\nAbout Hans Kieserman\nHans Kieserman is an infrastructure architect at Yahoo, currently working to build out as much Kubernetes as he can get away with. He has previously worked on payments infrastructure, web services, chaos engineering, and CI/CD systems. The power of open source initiatives are almost as fascinating as the culture that enables them to be successful in the enterprise."
