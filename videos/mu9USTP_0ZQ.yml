Marc Weber Tobias and his colleagues Tobias Bluzmanis and Matthew Fiddler will discuss a number of cases involving design issues that allow locks and safes to be opened in seconds, focusing on consumer-level containers that are specified as secure for storing valuables and weapons, and in-room hotel safes that travelers rely upon.\n\nIn one instance, the insecurity of a consumer gun safe that is sold by major retailers in the United States played a part in the death of a three year old child who was able to gain access to a handgun that was locked in a supposedly secure container.\n\nThe presenters will demonstrate different product designs that were represented as secure but in fact are not.\n\nMarc Weber Tobias is an investigative attorney and security specialist living in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

A ten-volume multimedia edition of his book (LSS+) is also available online.\n\nMarc has written extensively about the security vulnerabilities of products and has appeared in numerous television and radio interviews and news reports as well as magazine articles during the past thirty years.
