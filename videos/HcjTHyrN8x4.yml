What is the communication flow in the framework when an access to a specific device is asked by an Android application? \n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16eFfbA1anjb7jzMB5fe7icMfwATSCrJ9IQOzn3KcB8o/edit?usp=sharing\n\nDroidcon Paris 2015, more information here: http://droidcon.fr/schedule/"
