title: 'Hugo Shi - KitchenSink Framework for Working with Remote Datasets Interactively'
recordingDate: 1418146259
description: "PyData NYC 2014\nThe goal of this project is to make it easy to execute both registered and arbitrary functions on a remote server, just as easily as executing code locally. Passes back all stdout and stderr and exceptions back to the client so working remotely feels like working locally. Supports server side remote data objects, so large results can be left on the server/cluster, but interacted with easily."
