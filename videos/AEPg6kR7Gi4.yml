description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2016 in Washington, DC\nhttps://2016.appsecusa.org/\n\nContainerizing your Security Operations Center\n\nAs security professionals, we have no shortage of tools available to us in our offensive and defensive pursuits. How we choose to deploy, maintain, and share these tools across teams can prove to be burdensome and overly complex. Security teams are becoming swept up in the DevOps movement and we are being encouraged to bring visibility into our workflows and toolsets. This means moving things from our local boxes to a more available and collaborative environment. This talk will share lessons learned from building a pluggable, cloud­based \"Security Operations Center\" running entirely on containers to help security teams rapidly build out scanning pipelines, centralize alerts, investigate malware, and easily collaborate with teams across the organization. I’ll dive into the architecture and design of the cluster and how to quickly get a POC running in Kubernetes\n\nJimmy Mesta\nSr. Security Engineer, Invoca\nJimmy is an application security leader that has been involved in Information Security for nearly 10 years.
