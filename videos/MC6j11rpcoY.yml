description: "By, Bobby Wilson\nThis is not a scientific talk. It's a survey of each step in my process of creating something meaningful out of a pile of data. The talk will be a blend of anecdotes, process, data sources, tools available, and good ol' hacks. We live in a world filled with recorded data. Lots of that data is online, and retrievable in some fashion. Unfortunately, that data is often sparse, poorly labeled, and uninsured. Enter Ruby, with a wide variety of gems and libraries to help us trudge through funky data, store it, sort it out, and spit shine it for the masses.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GJR0/"
