description: "Mickey Lasky & David C. Smith: Cool stuff learned from competing in the DC3 digital forensic challenge.\nLast fall, the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) hosted a digital forensics challenge that included interesting puzzles such as physical media reconstruction, data carving, password cracking, and booting forensic images with virtual machines. My team from Georgetown University competed with a shoestring budget against a 140 teams and came in 4th place overall. The presentation will cover the individual challenges, our solutions, and the methodologies we developed to compete with the pros.\n\nDave Smith works at Georgetown University as the University Information Security Officer and manages a team to provide security services to the University in this time of data loss / e-discovery peril. Prior to becoming much more of 'the man? than he intended, Dave was a security consultant, active with open source projects, a 2600 meeting regular in DC / Northern VA area, and ran a bitchin WWIV BBS ? The Last Cigarette."
