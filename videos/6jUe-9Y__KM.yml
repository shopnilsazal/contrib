description: "RubyConf 2016 - From no OSS experience to the core team in 15 minutes a day by André Arko\n\nUsing and contributing to open source has been a cornerstone of the Ruby community for many years. Despite this strong tradition, it’s hard to find anything collecting the likely advantages and costs of working on open source. This talk will introduce open source work, the benefits and costs of doing that work, and then provide a straightforward list of activities that can be done by anyone, no matter their level of experience with programming. Pick a project, schedule at least 15 minutes per day, join the core team. It’s your destiny!"
