title: 'Padre, the Perl IDE: Building an open source team, getting the project to users against the odds'
recordingDate: 1266146518
description: "by Gregor Szabo\r\nWhen I started to build Padre, the Perl IDE in June 2008 almost everyone in the Perl community thought it is a waste of effort in a failed project to create something that no one wants. \r\n\r\nAfter 1.5 year, over 50 releases, more than 10,000 commits by many contributors we can say Padre is on its way to become the de facto editor for Perl 5 and Perl 6. \r\n\r\nIt would have not been possible without the growing support from the Perl community and without the reuse of over 200 CPAN modules written by other people. \r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll talk about Padre and how we managed to build the team. How we got included in all the major Linux distributions and what else have we done to build the product? \r\n\r\nPadre is a Perl IDE written in Perl 5. It provides special features for editing both Perl 5 and Perl 6 files. It is available on Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and Mac OSX. \r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nâ—¦http://padre.perlide.org/ \r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
