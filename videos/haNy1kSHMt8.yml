title: 'Designing Games That Include Social Simulation'
language: English
recordingDate: 1454001013
description: "Social simulation is a powerful yet underappreciated game design tool. Although other aspects of game simulation have grown vastly more sophisticated over the years, the ability for NPCs to interact dynamically with both the player and each other has remained limited. This talk covers a wide-ranging retrospective of social simulation in games, and explores how and if such interactions may be furthered. What is it that has impeded the expansion of social simulation mechanics? Is it the attitudes of players or developers? Also, what can social simulation offer your game? By offering answers and insights, this talk inspires deeper thought about exploring personal relationships through game systems.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
