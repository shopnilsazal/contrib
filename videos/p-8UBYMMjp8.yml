description: "\"DevOps: The past and future are here. It's just not evenly distributed (yet)\", by  Kris Buytaert, Inuits\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this video are those of the speaker(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the USENIX Association.**\r\n\r\nWe've come a long way since introducing new ideas in server automation and deployment, and also in creating a culture of collaboration between the traditional silos in organizations. But how does this impact the traditional sysadmin world? Are we all a DevOps now? Does a DevOps person = sysadmin 2.0? Will DevOps put us out of a job? I will give a brief overview of how culture, workflow, and behavior have evolved. After evaluating the past and the present, I will talk about the future, identifying technical gaps in monitoring, packaging, and data collection and identifying emerging human, organizational evolutions."
