description: "Running Mesos Frameworks on Kubernetes with the Open-Source Universal Resource Broker - Fritz Ferstl, UNIVA\n\nWhile Kubernetes continues to gain in popularity for cloud applications, many organizations run popular frameworks deployed on Mesos. The need to support multiple orchestration frameworks can result in added cost and complexity as organizations struggle to manage separate, siloed environments. Based on earlier work done for HPC users, Univa has contributed their Universal Resource Broker (URB) Technology to the Kubernetes community as an open-source project. The freely available software allows any Mesos compatible framework including (including Spark, Hadoop, Storm, Jenkins, Marathon and Chronos) to run along-side native Kubernetes services on a shared Kubernetes cluster providing the opportunity simplify environments and consolidate infrastructure. \n\nIn his talk Mr. Ferstl will discuss the challenge of running mixed workloads on Kubernetes, provide an architectural overview of the URB and provide a demonstration of the technology. He will also explain how Mesos users or application developers can get started quickly with the technology, and consider it for use in their own environments and applications.\n\nAbout Fritz Ferstl\nFritz is the Chief Technology Officer at Univa where he helps set technical direction for the company while also spearheading strategic alliances in EMEA. Fritz is widely regarded as the father of Grid Engine software and its forerunners Codine and GRD. He ran the Grid Engine software business at Sun Microsystems and Oracle taking it from an upstart technology to one of the worldâ€™s most widely deployed workload management solutions. Under Fritz's leadership Grid Engine software was open sourced, and grew into a vibrant community. Fritz holds a Masters in Applied Mathematics from the East Bavarian Technical University of Regensburg in Germany."
