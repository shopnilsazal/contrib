description: "by Heiko Tietze\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nToolbars are a common toolkit control that have been around since the dawn ofGUI applications, providing direct access to an application's most frequentlyused functions. But with increasing scope, the number of frequently usedfunctions grows to an extent that can have a detrimental impact on quicklylocating a particular item. LibreOffice made it possible to create UI basedtoolbars on blank canvas where designers have all the freedom to do whateverthey want with the space. The talk will present the reasoning behind theNotebookbar layout with contextual groups.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 10:10:00"
