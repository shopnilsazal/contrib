description: "In this session, we share best practices for using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) to optimize application deployment agility and ensure compliance across your infrastructure. ARM enables you to repeatedly deploy your app and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state. You define the infrastructure and dependencies for your app in a single declarative template that is flexible enough to use for all of your environments such as test, staging or production.\n\nWe'll look at ways that you can create, share and publish both ARM templates, as well as Azure Managed Applications. Azure Managed Applications build upon ARM templates to enable Managed Service Providers (MSPs), Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), and corporate central IT teams to deliver turnkey solutions through the Azure Marketplace or Service Catalog. These are self-contained and sealed to the consumer, allowing the provider to deliver a higher quality of service.\n\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree"
