title: '#HITB2016AMS D1T2 - Sandjacking: Profiting From iOS Malware - Chilik Tamir'
recordingDate: 1466570248
description: "Recently Apple introduced “Sign In With Apple Account” Development track, allowing anyone to write application for an i-Device and execute it, under the radar, no identification process required (e.g. anonymously).\n\nIn this presentation I will show new vulnerabilities that are now re-introduced into the Apple devices eco-system. I will demonstrate how easy it is to create an iOS evil client / malware application that targets both the personal and the corporate markets.\n\nEvil client can be used as a “Spy Phone” application, which stealthy monitors the presence of an Ex’, monitoring a spouses social private messages and communications and steal a target credentials and personal information.\n\nLast but not least I will unveil a new vulnerability – “SandJacking” – An attack which may be used to extract sensitive information from a targeted device, without leaving any visible trace. A tool will be released to demonstrate an evil client application that will extract sensitive information from the application sandbox.\n\nIn the talk we will cover the new aspects of these introduced threats and how an organization and individuals can mitigate against them.\n\n======\n\n\n\nExperienced security researcher, trainer and speaker (BlackHat USA, HITB Amsterdam, OWASP Israel, Intel, HP, Cisco, Amdocs, Verint, RedBend and others) Secure development of web products in the web 2.0 and the mobile market (Andriod,iOS). He is the creator of iNalyzer framework for penetration testing iPhone applications, as well as other security tools that he released. He was Chief Scientist at AppSec-Labs, responsible for Innovating and leading security development and research of tools, exploits and vulnerabilities in web applications.\n\nChilik is currently Chief Architect – Research and Development at Mi3 Security, Inc."
