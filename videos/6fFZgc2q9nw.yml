title: 'Michelle Fullwood - Grids, Streets & Pipelines: Making a linguistic streetmap with scikit-learn'
recordingDate: 1418154003
description: "PyData NYC 2014\nThis talk is aimed at scikit-learn novices who have built their first classifier with out-of-the-box features, been disappointed with the results, and wondered what to do for a next step. As a case study, I'll use a personal project to classify streetnames in Singapore according to their language of origin, which I then turned into a colour-coded streetmap. We'll build a baseline classifier using OpenStreetMap data, GeoPandas, and scikit-learn, then explore how to add your own feature Pipelines and how to tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV, including how to pick a parameter grid. Lastly we'll plot the map and review which method of improving the baseline classifier worked best: more data, adding features, hyperparameter tuning, or swapping out classifiers?"
