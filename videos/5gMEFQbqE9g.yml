description: "Leonard Gallion, A Safecracking Double Feature: Dial \"B\" For BackDialing and Spike the Wonder Safe\n\nThis presentation will introduce two powerful, non-destructive safe opening techniques. The first \"Dial B For BackDialing,\" will trace the history of back dialing all the way from Richard Feynman working on the atomic bomb (and opening safes) in the 1940's, to today. This presentation will show how mechanical safes have changed since Feynman's time, but how most are still vulnerable to both his method and the simpler Nascar(tm) technique. The next part of the presentation, \"Spike the Wonder Safe\" will demonstrate how to defeat the two locking mechanisms of a popular office safe using just an ink pen and a battery, all in under two minutes.\n\nLeonard Gallion, is the Vice President of Information Services for a Dallas Texas company and has over 20 years of experience in the I.T. and Security fields. Primarily focusing on the non-destructive (stealthy) compromise of physical security, he has publicly presented on such topics as lockpicking, safecracking and high security lock bypass. In addition, he published an article in the Summer 2004 issue of 2600 magazine on his hobby, creating \"Impromptu Lock Picks\" from common office supplies."
