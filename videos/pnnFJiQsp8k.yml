description: "By, Coraline Ehmke\nWhat happens when a highly visible and successful developer announces to the world that they plan to transition from male to female?\n\nIn August of 2013 I stood with friends on the stage at a Ruby conference and told the world that I am transgender. I began the long process of my personal, social, professional, and physical transition from male to female.\n\nI would like to share the lessons I'm learning, the perspective I'm gaining, and the inspiration I'm finding through the experience of living and working in two genders. How is this change impacting my career as a developer? Interactions with my peers? My relationship with the development community? Is it influencing how I create and appreciate code? My hope is to spark conversations and create opportunities for shared learning and growth by exploring the intersection of gender and technology.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FixM/"
