description: "Kubernetes in Action: Examples from Google Container Engine - Aparna Sinha & Robert Bailey, Google\n\nKubernetes deployments on Google’s cloud use the same underlying objects as on-premise, but with cloud provider specific networking, storage and services. This talk highlights the use of Kubernetes in Google Container Engine for different types of applications - Gaming, IoT and Analytics. We will walk through the generic architecture for each application type as well as specific implementations for illustration. Upgrading a Kubernetes cluster for greater scale, setting up multi-zone clusters for higher availability and using Ingress with L7 LB for global load balancing will be some of highlights.\n\nAbout Robert Bailey\nRobert has been working on Kubernetes for more than 2 years and was one of the founding members of the Google Container Engine team. Prior to Kubernetes, he was a Site Reliability Engineer helping teams around Google launch new products and services.\n\nAbout Aparna Sinha\nAparna Sinha leads the product management team at Google for Kubernetes. Prior to Google, Aparna has worked in enterprise software for 15+ years. She was previously Director of Product Management for NetApp’s manageability software where she also led development of storage plugins for Oracle, VMware, Unix and Windows. She holds a PhD in Engineering from Stanford and has several publications from her research work as well as a patent at Google on Android IoT protocols."
