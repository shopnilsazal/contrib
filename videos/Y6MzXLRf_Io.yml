description: "Don’t Believe the Hype: How We Navigated Federal Tech Policy to Bring Modern Development Practices to the Government by Shannon Sartin\n\nNavigating policy, regulatory, and legal constraints is a challenge for building products in almost every industry-- especially in the US Government. Working with stakeholders that aren’t on the same page about approaches to software development increases complexity for moving projects forward. At the USDS, we’ve worked to increase collaboration between policy and technical experts so that agencies can deliver technology enabled services to Americans. Our contracting partners have been integral to this success and share in their own pain points of trying to implement modern technology in a not so modern culture. In this session, both USDS and government contractors will discuss the barriers we faced, successes we had, and areas that still need improvement during our path to building a product that impacts millions of Americans, and three percent of the economy."
