description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nEntitlements: Understandable Container Security Controls - Justin Cormack & Nassim Eddequiouaq, Docker (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nIn this talk, Justin Cormack introduces a new system of security entitlements for container workloads. These specify the types of access a pod should have in a human readable way. He will also demonstrate an example implementation running in Kubernetes. The current pod security configuration is very low level, and does not really make any sense to users of the system. How can we make security configuration understandable? One route comes from the model of application entitlements that Apple uses on the iPhone to control things like access to Push Notifcations and Payments. The open source libentitlement library, being developed at Docker, enables similarly high level controls to be used for managing containers. The talk will also cover the relationship with Open Policy Agent and other access control frameworks, and relation to Linux Security Modules and PodSecurityPolicy.\n\nAbout Justin\nJustin is a Senior Software Engineer at Docker, working on security. He is based in Cambridge, UK. He is a maintainer of the Moby engine and LinuxKit, and has worked across many open source container projects. He was involved in the work to include Kubernetes in Docker for Mac. He has been to Kubecon twice before. He spoke at KubeCon EU last year on Containerd https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfhnioURGdE and has spoken at many events: Devoxx, Codemotion, CodeMesh, DockerCon, QCon and more.\n\nAbout Nassim\nNassim is a security engineer at Docker where he focuses on designing and creating new security features for the container ecosystem and making existing ones as usable as possible. Nassim previously spent a couple of years working on hobby kernels and reverse-engineering competitions before interning in the Trusted Execution team at Apple."
