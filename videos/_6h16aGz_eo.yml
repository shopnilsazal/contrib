recordingDate: 1424357929
description: "By, Michael Jackson\nAs a programmer one of your most useful tools is the regular expression. Like a trusty old hammer, Regexp is always ready and willing to parse your random bits of text with brutal precision and accuracy.\n\nBut there are some tasks for which regular expressions are not the best tool for the job. Parsing expressions are a relative newcomer in the field of text analysis. Libraries like Treetop and Citrus make it easy to use parsing expressions with Ruby. In this talk, we'll discuss potential applications for parsing expressions and how to use and test them in your Ruby code.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GJRX/"
