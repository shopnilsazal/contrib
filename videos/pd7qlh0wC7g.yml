This frontier is found in the most unlikely of places, where it is presumed that IT Security is a mature practice. Banks, Financial Institutions and Insurance Companies. High Speed Trading, High Frequency Trading, Low Latency Trading, Algorithmic Trading -- all words for electronic trades committed in microseconds without the intervention of humans. There are no firewalls, everything is custom and none of it is secure. It's SkyNet for Money and it's happening now.\n\nSpeaker , CISA, is Principal at Push The Stack Consulting providing security consulting services to the utility and financial verticals.
