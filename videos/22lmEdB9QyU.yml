description: "Georges Dubus - Through the lens of Haskell: exploring new ideas for library design\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nHaskell is very different from Python, and provide different tools to\nlibrary and framework designers. As a result, its ecosystem is filled\nwith libraries and frameworks that solve the same problems we try to\nsolve in our favorite programming languages, but with a very different\napproach.\n\nThis talk is an exploration of the Haskell ecosystem, from the point\nof view of a Python developer.\nWe will review various popular Haskell libraries and frameworks,\nfocusing on the library design. The goal is to provide the audience a\nsneak peak of some different ways to tackle problems, and hopefully to\ninspire library authors to explore some design space that we don't\nusually explore in Python.\n\nThis talk should be interesting to any intermediate Python programmer\nwho is curious about other ways to solve problems. No Haskell\nknowledge is required from the audience."
