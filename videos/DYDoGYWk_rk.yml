Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nLightning Talk: Why you Should Really Pay Attention to K8S Security Best Practices - Benjy Portnoy, Aqua Security (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nSome time ago, the CIS published a security benchmark for Kubernetes deployments. It's easy to regard this as a checkbox process, but what can actually happen if you neglect to follow only a few of its recommendations? In this lightning talk, I will demonstrate how Kubernetes configuration issues that may seem trivial make it possible for an attacker to exfiltrate data from a production environment.\n\nAbout Benjy\nBenjy is a seasoned cyber security professional with over 15 years experience in consulting, designing, and implementing strategic information security projects for organizations across EMEA.
