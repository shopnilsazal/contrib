description: "\"A journey into Git internals with Python\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - PythonAnywhere Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nDespite 12 years of history and wide popularity the workings of Git still remain largely a mystery for many.  A lot of Git users operate it just by remembering a bunch of commands and repeating them in a correct order.  I was one of them until I decided to dig deeper into how Git actually works and suddenly I understood that internally Git operates by rather simple principles and after you figure them out suddenly all those commands start to make sense. To look into the Git's internal structure you need a programming language to crunch the data and Python fit perfectly for this task.\n\nIn this talk, I will dig into the internals of Git with Python, that will help you better understand how Git works.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
