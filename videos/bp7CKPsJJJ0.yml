recordingDate: 1405976053
description: "Recently it has become common practise for development teams to deploy their code several times a day, as well as encouraging new developers to deploy on their first day at work.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss how I use continuous deployment to push these practises to the extreme. Automatically deploying the master branch on new changes is an awesome way to improve your development process.\n\nAutomatically deploying master will fundamentally change how you work. Gone are the days of the epic pull request. You'll quickly find yourself writing smaller more manageable chunks of code, that overall have a great impact on the quality of the software you produce.\n\nBy the end of the talk you'll know how to change the GitHub merge pull request button into a deploy button - and have the confidence to do so.\n\nSome things I'll go over in the talk:\n\nHow to setup your CI environment for deployments\nWhy having fast tests are important\nHow to use your Staging environment for testing deployments\nHow to use feature flags to hide deployed features from some users\nZero downtime deploys, even when there are database migrations\nYour new deploy button, AKA The GitHub merge pull request button\nWhat to do when deployment goes wrong\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGZB/"
