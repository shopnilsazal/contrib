description: 'In a world filled with danger emanating from all sorts of digital channels, having a proxy (or two) that you create, control, manage and direct is not just useful, but a requirement. Instead of worrying about an ineffectual government or an incomprehensible privacy policy, itâ€™s possible that fake identities are a way to take ownership of the problem. Fake identities in the hands of the individual, are the way to swing the pendulum of privacy back to the people. The presentation will present our progress at building tools for people to implement fake identities to use offline and online. At the time of writing this abstract our users have 2 million active fake identities and the number is growing daily. These identities are used for dating, shopping, selling, social media, political statements and for numerous other uses.'
