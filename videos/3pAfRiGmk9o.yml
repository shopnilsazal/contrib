description: "PyData DC 2016\n\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/PyData/graphgen-conducting-graph-analytics-over-relational-databases-67649554\nDownload and learn about GraphGen at: konstantinosx.github.io/graphgen-project/\nDDL Blog Post and Tutorial at: blog.districtdatalabs.com/graph-analytics-over-relational-datasets\nNote: Currently GraphGenPy is built for Python 2.0.  Python 3.0 support coming soon!\n\nApplying graph analytics on data stored in relational databases can provide tremendous value in many application domains. We discuss the importance of leveraging these analyses, and the challenges in enabling them. We present a tool, called GraphGen, that allows users to visually explore, and rapidly analyze (using NetworkX) different graph structures present in their databases."
