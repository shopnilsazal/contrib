description: "PyData Carolinas 2016\n\nSocial Network Analysis (SNA), the study of the relational structure between actors, is used throughout the social and natural sciences to discover insight from connected entities. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the NetworkX library to analyze network data in Python, emphasizing intuition over theory.\n\nMethods will be illustrated using a dataset of the romantic relationships between characters on \"Grey's Anatomy\", an American medical drama on the ABC television network. Analysis and intuition will be emphasized over theory and mathematical rigor. An IPython/Jupyter notebook format will be used as we code through the examples together."
