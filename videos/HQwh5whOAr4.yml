recordingDate: 1473755907
description: "Fake president scams are on the rise. Fraudsters use fake identities to impersonate leaders of a company and trick employees to transfer large sums of money to the fraudster. More often than not, the transferred money is deposited from the target bank accounts within minutes, and the victim organizations are left with the damage.\n\nThis talk discusses the psychology behind fake president scams, guides through recent, prominent cases and proposes solutions both to prevent such scams and to mitigate ongoing scams.\n\n=== \n\nFlorian Lukavsky started his hacker career in early ages, bypassing parental control systems. Since then, he reported numerous zero-day vulnerabilities responsibly to software vendors and conducted hundreds of pentests and security reviews as a CREST certified, ethical hacker.\n\nToday, Florian Lukavsky heads SEC Consult in Singapore and the APAC region. With offices in Europe, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia, SEC Consult is an international leader in application security services, information security consultancy and provides innovative security solutions like CyberTrap. Having defined security standards and regulations in Europe, SEC Consult and Florian are now devoting their expertise to aid Singaporean organizations to be ahead of cyber criminals."
