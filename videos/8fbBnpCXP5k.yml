If you have experienced some or all of these concerns, we have the answer and it’s service mesh with Istio! \n\nJoin us to hear how you can leverage Istio’s intelligent routing feature to roll out newer version of services, apply rate limiting to your services to shed load and gracefully degrade as services fail, and visualize the dependencies and flow of traffic between services to provide optimized user experience to your users as you continuously deliver new updates to your microservice based application.\n\nAbout Mandar Jog\nMandar Jog is a senior software engineer at Google working on Istio. \nMandar is specifically focussed on Istio configuration and Mixer.\n\nPrior to Google, Mandar has led an engineering team at a startup and worked at Pivotal helping customers deploy Cloud Foundry.
