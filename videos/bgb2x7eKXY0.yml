title: 'Simplifying Web App Development With Elm and Functional Programming - Ingar Almklov'
recordingDate: 1518772579
description: "What we ultimately want from the tools we use for development is for them to make our lives easier. We developers want to make great user experiences, and in this session we will look at how Elm and functional programming enables this while maintaining our own sanity.\n\nTo achieve a well-functioning development team it's important to focus on developer experience. I will share my experiences from being a frontend tech lead and show how Elm and FP does a lot of things right in letting developers focus on solving the right problems instead of worrying about less important details.\n\nIn addition to this we will look at how we can lower the barrier for both writing and discovering documentation of our code-base by integrating it in the app we are developing. When developing a web app we can also add live previews of our graphical UI components!"
