description: "Can one do better than XGBoost? Presenting 2 new gradient boosting libraries - LightGBM and Catboost\nMateusz Susik\n\nDescription\nWe will present two recent contestants to the XGBoost library: LightGBM (released October 2016) and CatBoost (open-sourced July 2017). The participant will learn the theoretical and practical differences between these libraries. Finally, we will describe how we use gradient boosting libraries at McKinsey & Company.\n\nAbstract\nGradient boosting proved to be a very effective method for classification and regression in the last years. A lot of successful business applications and data science contest solutions were developed around the XGBoost library. It seemed that XGBoost will dominate the field for many years.\n\nRecently, two major players have released their own implementation of the algorithm. The first - LightGBM - comes from Microsoft. Its major advantages are lower memory usage and faster training speed.\n\nThe second - Catboost - was implemented by Yandex. Here, the approach was different. The aim of the library was to improve on top of the state-of-the-art gradient boosting algorithm performance in terms of accuracy.\n\nDuring the talk, the participants will learn about the differences in the algorithm designs, APIs and performances.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
