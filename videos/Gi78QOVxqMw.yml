description: "DevOpsDays Chicago 2017 - Ignites- Devops Deeper Thoughts by Not Jack Handey by Joshua Zimmerman\n\nIf you thought that last year’s thoughts were deep, wait until you hear this year’s. Not Jack Handey returns with another ignite full of one-liner jokes and fun “facts” about devops inspired by the SNL segments of yesteryear.\n\nThis talk is primarily tongue-in-cheek humor and will be comprised of “deep thoughts” that are entirely new to Chicago (aside from maybe one or two favorites from last year). There will be some “thoughts” pulled from other iterations of Devops Deep Thoughts and many entirely new “thoughts”."
