description: "High Cost Tests and High Value Tests by Noel Rappin\n\nThere is a value in writing tests and there is also a cost. The currency is time.

The writer of the test bears much of the short term cost while long term benefits and cost are borne by the rest of the team.

How can you tell if testing is helping? Here are some strategies to improve your tests and code."
