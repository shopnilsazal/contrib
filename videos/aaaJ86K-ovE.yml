description: "Blake Self & bitemytaco - Hacking DOCSIS For Fun and Profit\nAt Defcon 16 we showed various modifications and techniques to gain free and anonymous cable modem internet access. During our last talk, the DOCSIS hacking scene was behind the cable companies. Thanks to the efforts of SBHacker and others, we our now ahead of the cable companies. This talk will analyze and discuss the tools, techniques, and technology behind hacking DOCIS 3.0. We will also cover new areas like hacking PacketCable and discuss all of the DOCSIS related arrests since our last speech. We will be releasing the Haxomatic USB JTAG/SPI programmer by Rajkosto & SBHacker and updated DOCSIS 3.0 hacked firmware for TI puma5-based cable modems at this talk.\n\nBlake Self is most widely known for co-authoring the first commercial encrypted instant messenger with Dr. Cyrus Peikari while at VirusMD. He has also worked as a SIPRNET Administrator, Department of Defense Red Team Analyst, and R&D at various corporations including Airscanner and Ontario Systems. He currently works in the automated data collection industry as well as doing research for S2ERC (http://www.serc.net).\n\nBitemytaco is a well-known person in the DOCSIS research community and one of the root admins at SBHacker.net, the largest modem hacking community in the world. He funded the development of Haxorware (coded by Rajkosto) - the most popular and innovative diagnostic cable modem firmware ever released. He also coordinated the development of the current hacked SB6120 firmware and released it to the public on Christmas 2009. Taco has been researching cable modem networks since 1998 and has been involved in the modem hacking scene for many years. \"DOCSIS: Insecure By Design\" was presented at DEFCON 16 by Taco along with teammates Blake of SERC and devDelay of SBHacker.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
