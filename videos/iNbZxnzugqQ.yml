description: "Tom Eston, Josh Abraham and Kevin Johnson - Don't Drop the SOAP: Real World Web Service Testing for Web Hacker\nOver the years web services have become an integral part of web and mobile applications. From critical business applications like SAP to mobile applications used by millions, web services are becoming more of an attack vector than ever before. Unfortunately, penetration testers haven't kept up with the popularity of web services, recent advancements in web service technology, testing methodologies and tools. In fact, most of the methodologies and tools currently available either don't work properly, are poorly designed or don't fully test for real world web service vulnerabilities. In addition, environments for testing web service tools and attack techniques have been limited to home grown solutions or worse yet, production environments.\n\nIn this presentation Tom, Josh and Kevin will discuss the new security issues with web services and release an updated web service testing methodology that will be integrated into the OWASP testing guide, new Metasploit modules and exploits for attacking web services and a open source vulnerable web service for the Samurai-WTF (Web Testing Framework) that can be used by penetration testers to test web service attack tools and techniques.\n\nTom Eston is a Senior Security Consultant for SecureState. Tom is a senior member of SecureState's Profiling team, which provides attack and penetration testing services for SecureState's clients. Tom focuses much of his research on new technologies such as social media and mobile devices. He is the founder of SocialMediaSecurity.com which is an open source community dedicated to exposing the insecurities of social media. Tom is also a security blogger, co-host of the Security Justice and Social Media Security podcasts and is a frequent speaker at security user groups and national conferences including Notacon, OWASP AppSec, DEFCON and ShmooCon.\n\nTwitter: @agent0x0\n\nJoshua \"Jabra\" Abraham joined Rapid7 in 2006 as a Security Consultant.
