description: "Doing Bad Things to 'Good' Security Appliances \nPHORKUS (MARK CAREY) CHIEF SCIENTIST, PEAK SECURITY \nEVILROB (ROB BATHURST) THAT GUY\n\nThe problem with security appliances is verifying that they are as good as the marketing has lead you to believe. You need to spend lots of money to buy a unit, or figure out how to obtain it another way; we chose eBay. We now have a hardened, encrypted, AES 256 tape storage unit and a mission, break it every way possible! We're going to dive into the finer points of the pain required to actually evaluate and disassemble a harden security appliance. We'll be delving into such fun topics as epoxy melting, de-soldering, ROM chip reading, FGPA configuration recreation, Verilog decoding, recovering the various key strands that keep the device/data secure, and any other topics we end up straying into.\n\nPhorkus (Mark Carey) (@PeakSec) is a professional Security Engineer with over 18 years of experience in the areas of Information Technology, Rapid Development Lifecycle, Long Term Development Lifecycle, Computer Security, and Research/Development Innovation. He is a partner in Peak Security Inc (www.peaksec.com) where he serves as a Principal Security Consultant and Chief Scientist. Mark has developed many security tools used throughout the corporate and government sectors. Mark has co-authored Network Auditing with Nessus (second edition), and has published internal white-papers for many government agencies. \nFacebook\n\nEvilrob (Rob Bathurst) is a Security and Network Engineer with over 12 years of experience with large multi-national network architecture and security engineering. His focus is on network security architecture, tool development, and high-assurance device reverse engineering. Rob has published multiple internal corporate and government whitepapers across multiple security domains, written a book on Hacking OS X, and is currently working on his Master's Degree at the University of Oxford.\n\nMaterials: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Phorkus-Evilrob/DEFCON-21-Phorkus-Evilrob-Hacking-Embedded-Devices-Bad-things-to-Good-hardware.pdf"
