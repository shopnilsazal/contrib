description: "RailsConf 2018: Building a Collaborative Text Editor by Justin Weiss\n\nHave you ever clicked \"Save\" on a document, and caused a coworker to lose hours of work? Or spent more time coordinating \"Who has permission to edit\" in Slack than you did actually writing the document?\n\nGoogle-Docs-style collaboration used to be nice to have. Now, it's expected. Companies like Quip and Coda have based their business on real-time collaboration features. Atom and Sublime Text have collaborative editing plugins. Even Confluence now supports collaborative editing!\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn how to build a great collaborative experience, based on solid fundamental ideas."
