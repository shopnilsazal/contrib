description: 'I want to share my insights on how we created an effective agile team for a new project. We managed to maintain a very vibrant team spirit in addition to following well-known agile methods. Most of the techniques we used have equally proven valuable in my other teams within a corporate environment. To increase the team velocity and make it more than the sum of its parts, it takes more than to motivate people with salaries and bonuses. This is hard to explain to managers, but a vibrant, dynamic and effective team has to be built differently. It can be achieved only when information is effectively shared, barriers are being removed and team members are kept happy and excited!'
