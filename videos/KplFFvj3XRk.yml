description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nEverything you Need to Know about using GPUs with Kubernetes - Rohit Agarwal, Google (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nThis talk will start by describing the need for making Kubernetes aware of resources like GPUs. Then it will briefly go into the history of GPU support in Kubernetes and the various backwards incompatible changes it has gone through. It will then describe the current state of GPU support in Kubernetes and the best practices for both Kubernetes users (app developers requiring GPUs) and Kubernetes cluster operators (that are managing machines containing GPUs). Specifically, it will touch on managing GPU drivers, device-plugins, advanced GPU scheduling and the newly added GPU monitoring support. Then it will describe what we learnt from running hundreds of GPU clusters in GKE. Finally it will briefly mention what's coming next in Kubernetes with regards to GPUs and other hardware accelerators and devices.\n\nAbout Rohit\nRohit Agarwal works on Kubernetes at Google. His current focus area is hardware accelerator support in Kubernetes. Prior to Google, Rohit worked on data infrastructure at Cloudflare and Qubole. He holds a B. Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Ropar."
