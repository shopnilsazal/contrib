recordingDate: 1418156621
description: "View slides for this presentation here:\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/PyData/analyzing-satellite-images-with-python-scientific-stack\n\nPyData NYC 2014\nPython has a rich ecosystem of open source geographical information science (GIS) applications. Most of the GIS packages are Python bindings to binaries for data transformation and image manipulation. This makes it hard to study what the data processing encompasses and masks the underlying algorithms. This talk will use Landsat 8 satellite imagery and Python scientific stack to demonstrate a typical data-centric approach for GIS analysis and at the same time explain algorithmic underpinnings. Image recognition and machine learning techniques will be applied to satellite images to expose the data's openness to exploration."
