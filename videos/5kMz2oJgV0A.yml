description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nClusters as Cattle: How to Seamlessly Migrate Apps across Kubernetes Clusters - Andy Goldstein, Heptio (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nBefore the arrival of Cloud Native, IT departments frequently treated each component--a service/application, a virtual machine, or a bare metal server--as a special, fragile entity that required the utmost of care. Kubernetes, and more broadly Cloud Native, presents us with better ways to handle our infrastructure. For example, when we need to upgrade to a newer Kubernetes version, we can use automation and tooling to create a new cluster and migrate existing workloads over to it. In this talk, Andy will describe different strategies for moving workloads between clusters. He'll show you how to use tools such as Ansible and Kubeadm to quickly install a new cluster, along with Heptio Ark to back up one cluster and restore into a new one. Andy will also demonstrate how you can perform zero-downtime migrations using Envoy for cluster ingress, traffic shifting, and some DNS “magic.”\n\nAbout Andy\nAndy Goldstein is an engineer at Heptio where he works on tooling to make operating Kubernetes clusters easier, such as Ark, a disaster recovery tool for backing up and restoring Kubernetes workloads and persistent data. He is also a contributor to Kubernetes. Prior to his current role, Andy worked on Kubernetes and OpenShift at Red Hat. Andy lives in Rockville, MD, with his wife, two children, and two noisy cats."
