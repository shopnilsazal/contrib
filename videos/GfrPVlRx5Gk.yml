description: "Bottoms-Up Adoption of a Microservices Workflow Using Kubernetes & Envoy - Rafael Schloming & Phil Lombardi, Datawire\n\nMany organizations start their microservices journey by (re)designing their application architecture and operational infrastructure. We started building our cloud application using this approach. We discovered that this takes a long time.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll talk about how we ended up with a different approach when we started thinking about microservices as a workflow, and not an architecture. We’ll talk about our first goal: enabling a single developer to be able to code, ship, and manage a microservice, as quickly as possible. We’ll show how we integrated Kubernetes, Docker, Prometheus, and Envoy to achieve this goal.\n\nFinally, we’ll talk about scaling this initial goal beyond a single developer. We’ll talk about the tradeoffs of this bottoms up approach to the conventional PAAS / service mesh / application architecture strategy, and show how you can get to the same place in the end.\n\nAbout Phil Lombardi\nPhil Lombardi is a Senior Platform Engineer at Datawire.io where he is building a development platform aimed at small companies adopting or using microservices and with a need for their platform to be simple, resilient and adaptable to the ever-changing tech landscape. He has spoken on microservices at many technical conferences like Velocity, NGINX Conf, and Boston DevOps Days. When not pounding on his keyboard or wrangling cloud infrastructure Phil is often found hitting the links to play golf or wandering around the city of Boston looking for the next exciting thing to do.\n\nAbout Rafael Schloming\nRafael Schloming is Co-founder and Chief Architect of Datawire. He is a globally recognized expert on messaging and distributed systems and a spec author of the AMQP specification. He has spoken on microservices at numerous technical conferences including ApacheCon, the O’Reilly Software Architecture Conference, Velocity, and the Microservices Practitioner Summit. Previously, Rafael was a principal software engineer at Red Hat. Rafael has a B.S. in computer science from MIT."
