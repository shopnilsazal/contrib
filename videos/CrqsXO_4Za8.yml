description: "The Rubyist's Illustrated Rust Adventure Survival Guide by Liz Baillie\n\nProgramming is an adventure, often more harrowing than it has to be. If you're more used to higher-level languages like Ruby or JavaScript, learning a lower-level language like Rust can feel like an impossible journey that leaves you wishing for a well-written and heavily illustrated field guide. Good news! I have already gone down this road and am now prepared to share my adventure with you. Luckily, I was able to capture much of the flora and fauna of Rustlandia with my primitive pictorial devices (paper and pen)."
