description: "By Aaron Patterson.\nLet's talk about speed! In this talk, we'll examine ways that we've been speeding up Rails for the next release. We'll look at techniques used for speeding up database interaction as well as view processing. Techniques for finding bottlenecks and eliminating them will be presented, and we'll talk about how these techniques work with regard to Rails applications themselves. The presenter will also be discussing ways to speak in first person.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGYH/"
