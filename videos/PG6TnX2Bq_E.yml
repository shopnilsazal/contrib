title: 'A Mentor in the Limelight by Justin Martin, Paul Pagel'
recordingDate: 1323220343
description: 'Learning how to be a well versed and competent developer is a life long process, but it must begin somewhere. One of the toughest parts about starting a career as a developer is the massive technology stack involved in pushing anything out to the real world. Similar to learning physics, chemistry, or biology for the first time, there is a whole language you need to learn before you can achieve any sort of mastery. With Limelight, you can teach the fundamental principles of becoming a Software Craftsman while only using Ruby! We will first explore Limelight as an educational tool, and then get our hands on our keyboards and work through an example Limelight Lesson. We will actually be writing some code! If you have JRuby on your machine, Limelight will do the rest of the setup.'
