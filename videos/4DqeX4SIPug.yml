description: "By Boudewijn Rempt \r\n\r\nThe Calligra Suite (formely known as KOffice) is modern application suite comprising productivity and creativity applications. The productivity applications natively support the OpenDocument standard. Through a plugin system, conversion from most Microsoft Office file formats is supported. Because of a clear separation between engine and user interface, it is easy to create new user interfaces on top of the existing engine. Calligra provides support both for QWidget-based applications as for QGraphicsView and Qt Quick based applications. During this presentation, you will learn how to show an OpenDocument document using a Calligra canvas in a host application -- both QWidget-based and Qt Quick based. We will also discuss remaining issues in the Calligra architecture and the way forward to resolve those.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
