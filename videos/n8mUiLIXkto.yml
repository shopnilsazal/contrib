description: "Keynote: OpenTracing and Containers: Depth, Breadth, and the Future of Tracing - Ben Sigelman, Co-Founder, LightStep\n\n\"Those building microservices at scale understand the role and importance of distributed tracing: it’s the most direct way to understand how and why a system is misbehaving. But distributed tracing has long harbored a dirty secret: the source code instrumentation can been complex, fragile, expensive, and difficult to maintain.\n\nThe OpenTracing project addresses that integration problem through standardization and collaborations with other open-source software systems. In this talk, Ben will begin by describing OpenTracing and explaining why you should care about it. He will then show how OpenTracing will be able to deliver zero-touch, black-box instrumentation of distributed applications via orchestration systems like Kubernetes, and why that could change the way we all reason about distributed computation.\"\n\nAbout Ben Sigelman\nBen is a cofounder at LightStep, a company that makes complex microservice applications more transparent and reliable. Previously, Ben spent nine years at Google where he ate lots of snacks and designed several large (~1M-process) distributed systems. The most significant of these were Dapper, an always-on distributed tracing system; and Monarch, a high-availability timeseries collection, storage, and query system.​"
