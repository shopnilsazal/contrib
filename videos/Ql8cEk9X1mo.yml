description: "Alena Dzenisenka\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2015/dotnetfringe/sdkttg/\nThe talk is dedicated to F#, MBrace framework and Azure as uber-innovative open source tools outrunning the competitors.\nOn advanced level an overview of the unique F# feature, such as computation expressions or monadic computations will be described, that makes possible to introduce language integrated domain specific language to control the custom flow, side effects, ambiguous unpredictable behavior, which shows absolutely innovative usage of F# language.\nOn the base of F# computation expressions open-source framework MBrace will be presented as a distributed computational framework engine for cloud computing and performing highly loaded jobs on big data, executing in non-blocking way, managing the state across the cluster of same-network nodes. MBrace framework constructions, architectural design and practical implementation model will be covered using the demonstration of full solution potential with Azure infrastructural services and open source Brisk engine.\nAs a result, undeniable advantages of both individual technologies: F#, MBrace, Azure and their combination in solving complex and frequently used tasks, like highly scalable data-intensive computations, processing of huge amounts of distributed data in cloud environment will be obvious.\nArchitecture construction examples, code fragments, demo of parallel computation tasks execution and the result will be presented, clearly showing that .NET Open Source stack is finally shooting ahead and is the best alternative to existing solutions, such as Hadoop."
