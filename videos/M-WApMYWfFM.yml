description: 'Teleradiology is an $8 billion dollar a year industry and we are going to disrupt it. Medical records are critical infrastructure, and with an increasing emphasis on real-time interpretations of medical imagery to improve healthcare outcomes in emergency situations, it is imperative the systems that enable medical collaboration are secure and reliable. Here we present an Ethereum-based application that allows anyone who needs help interpreting an image to reach out to a radiologist anywhere in the world, securely, privately, without a third party intermediary, and for a lower price than existing teleradiology firms.'
