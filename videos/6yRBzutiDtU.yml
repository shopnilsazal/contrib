description: "DEF CON 16 - Renderman:How can I pwn thee? Let me count the ways\nThe wonders of technology have given rise to a new breed of workforce, the mobile workforce. Able to leap large oceans in a single cattle class bound, they are the newest agent of business and the newest pain in your butt. The average business traveler carries with him a multitude of ways to get pwn'd while away from the office and away from your watchful BOFH eye. Come count the ways we can pwn that beleaguered business traveler without even touching him.\n\nRenderman is a Canadian born and raised hacker, co-refounder of the Church of Wifi and a 10 year attendee of Defcon and numerous other hacker cons. He has been a highly visible and active member of the wardriving community, helping to improve attacks where he can, such as the WPA-PSK rainbow tables. Co-author of \"RFID Security\" and \"Kismet Hacking\" by Syngress publishing, he can usually be found taking something wireless apart and stuffing it inside a children's plaything, picking locks, at the bar, or looking for more employment to keep up his globe trotting, hacker con lifestyle. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
