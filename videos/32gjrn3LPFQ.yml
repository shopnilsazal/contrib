title: 'LA Rubyconf 2015- Data Migrations with MagLev by JohnnyT'
recordingDate: 1446153828
description: "Data Migrations with MagLev\n\nMagLev is a Ruby implementation built on top of a VM which offers native object persistence - you are able to persist plain Ruby objects (including procs and lambdas) and then see and use them from any other connected VM. We are now using MagLev in production and have already learned some good lessons on working with and migrating these committed objects long term. Come and hear about recent MagLev updates and and appreciate the following quote on another level:  I always knew that one day Smalltalk would replace Java. I just didn't know it would be called Ruby. -- Kent Beck"
