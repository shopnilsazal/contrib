description: "PyData London 2017\n\nDescription\nIn this talk we will cover how Expedia has been ranking hotel images using deep learning techniques in Python.\n\nAbstract\nAttractive hotel images can influence the hotels that customers book online. However,selecting the best images is not a trivial problem, as there are tens of million images,and each customer can have their own image preferences (e.g. family vs. business customer). Displaying the best images for each hotel would have a significant impact on conversion. In this talk we will cover how Expedia has been ranking hotel images using deep learning techniques in Python.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
