description: "Description\nIn this talk we want to speak about a number of adventures we have had applying evolutionary algorithms to board games, card games and anything else.\n\nAbstract\nIn this talk we want to educate and entertain by showing a number of strange and wonderful examples of evolutionary algorithms and their results, all implemented in a new python library for evolutionary algorithms named 'evol'. Examples include: finding the ultimate strategy for rock-paper-scissors, how to beat your friends with sushi-go, or optimising your pub-crawl strategy in Warsaw.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
