description: "his presentation will self-destruct in 45 minutes: A forensic deep dive into self-destructing message apps \nDREA LONDON DIGITAL FORENSIC EXAMINER, STROZ FRIEDBERG \nKYLE O'MEARA DIGITAL FORENSIC EXAMINER, STROZ FRIEDBERG\n\nPrior to 2013, the phrase 'Self Destructing Message' was most commonly associated with Inspector Gadget, Maxwell Smart, and the occasional Tom Cruise movie. With the advent of smartphone apps like Snapchat, Wickr, and Facebook Poke, the self-destructing message has left the world of 'International Men of Mystery' and arrived to the civilian world by way of smart phone applications. These apps, and others, claim to provide ephemeral or private messaging to assure senders that their messages are burnt after reading.\n\nA message can be encrypted, but that does not make it clandestine or deniable. Through the use of forensic images, packet captures, and API review - we have recovered a wide range of artifacts from messages before, after, and during transmission. We are neutral, fact finding, forensic examiners on a mission. A mission to seek truth and provide you with the results of our deep dive forensic review of self-destructing messaging smartphone apps.\n\nAndrea (Drea) London (@strozfriedberg) is a Digital Forensic Examiner in Stroz Friedberg's Dallas office.
