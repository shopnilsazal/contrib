title: 'Unik: Unikernel Runtime for Kubernetes by Idit Levine, EMC'

description: "Unik: Unikernel Runtime for Kubernetes - Idit Levine, EMC\n\n\"UniK is an open-source tool written in Go for compiling applications into unikernels and deploying those unikernels across a variety of cloud providers, embedded devices (IoT), as well as a developer laptop or workstation. ​UniK​ utilizes a simple docker-like command-line interface, making developing on unikernels as easy as developing on containers. ​UniK​’s convenient REST API makes integrating ​UniK​ with orchestration tools a breeze. To demonstrate the value of cluster management of unikernels, we implemented a UniK runtime for Kubernetes, making Kubernetes the first cluster manager to support unikernels. This integration allows UniK to take advantage of core Kubernetes features like horizontal scaling, automated rollouts and rollbacks, storage orchestration, self-healing, service discovery, load balancing and batch execution.\n\nOn top of it all, ​UniK​ offers a highly pluggable and scalable architecture, allowing developers to add support for new processor architectures, programming languages, unikernel compilers, and cloud providers with ease.\"\n\nAbout Idit Levine \nIdit Levine is the CTO for cloud management division at EMC and a member of its global CTO office. Her passion and expertise are focused on Management and Orchestration (M&O) over the entire stack and on microservice, cloud native apps and Platform as a Service. Idit’s fascination with the cloud sprouted when she joined DynamicOps (vCAC, now part of VMware) as one of its first employees. She subsequently took part in developing the new-generation public cloud of Verizon Terremark, and served as an acting-CTO at Intigua, a startup company that focuses on container and management technology."
