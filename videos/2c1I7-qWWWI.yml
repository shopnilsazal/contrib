description: "No battery, no (watch) life!! by Michael Kwan\n\nSmartwatches are smaller and lighter than any handset! Anything that drains slightly more power can tank your battery life.\n\nThis talk is a set of case files from a detective’s investigation of what killed the battery this time, and the various culprits involved. With a full mobile operating system running on the device, there’s plenty of suspects.\n\nMichael Kwan has worked on Android Wear for a while now, but he’s had a watch frequently strapped to his wrist since he was a young’un. He likes climbing things and plays way too many board games, but somehow has yet to do both at the same time."
