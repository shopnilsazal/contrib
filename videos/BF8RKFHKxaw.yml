description: "Panel - Of Bytes and Bullets\nThis authors' panel has all the makings of a page-turning bestseller: crime lords, heroes, spies, global cartels, corporate scandals, hi-tech gizmos, betrayal, revolution, political intrigue, and midnight assassination attempts. As with all good books, it's the characters -- the researchers, the criminals, and the victims -- and their unique stories that will keep you riveted to your seat.\n\nJeffrey Carr, (Principal, GreyLogic) is a cyber intelligence expert, columnist for Forbes Firewall blog, and cyber warfare author who specializes in the investigation of cyber attacks against governments and infrastructures by State and Non-State hackers. Mr. Carr regularly consults with agencies of the U.S. and allied governments on Russian and Chinese cyber warfare strategy and tactics as well as new and emerging threats to Critical Infrastructure. His book \"Inside Cyber Warfare\" has been endorsed by General Chilton, Commander USSTRATCOM and his Chief of Staff MG Abraham Turner, among others, and he has been asked to speak on these issues at numerous venues including the Defense Intelligence Agency, US Army War College, Air Force Institute of Technology, NATO's CCDCOE Conference on Cyber Conflict, and DEFCON.\n\nRobert K.
