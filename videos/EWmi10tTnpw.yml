description: "Have you ever heard of non blocking web servers?  Have you  tried it in Java? Curious?\n\nLet me show you how to write simple HTTP Rest Server using Ratpack library. Yes library - because it is not another vast framework.  Just a small tool for big things! I will show how non blocking architecture works - and yes one thread can handle thousands of simultaneous HTTP connections in Java. We will see why using more threads on server is not the best option every time - and we will try to find the sweet spot for performance. We will deal with topics such as:  REST, WebSockets, persistence (with and without SQL databases), asynchronous IO, blocking IO,  RxJava 2.0, JavaSlang, immutability and more.\n\nAnd yes - there will be mondas, a lot of them, you are going to love them. They are terrific.\n\nAll that on a  working example of a simple  web based multiplayer game."
