recordingDate: 1506657587
description: "CrowdStrike continues to expose unprecedented efforts by highly sophisticated adversaries targeting — and in some cases, selectively leaking — information stolen from sensitive government, corporate and private networks. These intrusions reflect a broad range of motives and targets, revealing many never-before-seen tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that are advancing the art of data manipulation and attack obfuscation, while raising the bar significantly for organizations seeking to protect themselves from these potentially disruptive and destructive attacks. This session will shed light on alarming new trends CrowdStrike has observed in the global cyber threat landscape, and the evolving best practices that are proving most successful against criminal, hactivist and nation-state adversaries.\n\n=== \n\nSerial entrepreneur George Kurtz co-founded CrowdStrike, a leading provider of next-generation endpoint protection, threat intelligence, and services. Kurtz is an internationally recognized security expert, author, entrepreneur, and speaker. He has more than 23+ years of experience in the security space,including extensive experience driving revenue growth and scaling small and large organizations.
