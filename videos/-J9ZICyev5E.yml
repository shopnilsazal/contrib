title: 'Sarah Guido - K-means Clustering with scikit-learn'
recordingDate: 1402701819
description: "PyData SV 2014 \nIn machine learning, clustering is a good way to explore your data and pull out patterns and relationships. Scikit-learn has some great clustering functionality, including the k-means clustering algorithm, which is among the easiest to understand. Let's take an in-depth look at k-means clustering and how to use it. This mini-tutorial/talk will cover what sort of problems k-means clustering is good at solving, how the algorithm works, how to choose k, how to tune the algorithm's parameters, and how to implement it on a set of data."
