You might want reproducible, minimal, or unprivileged builds. This talk will cover the alternative tools that exist to build docker images without docker. It will cover building images with tools like BuildKit, distroless, and buildah. It will compare the benefits and trade-offs of each tool as well as general patterns and anti-patterns to follow when building your images. Additionally, it will cover tools to manipulate and inspect those images.\n\nAbout Matt\nMatt Rickard is a Software Engineer at Google.
