description: "We have a tendency to forget that the product isn't just the pretty website that the user sees. The product also includes all the people standing behind it. Taking on non-development roles gives us a broader perspective and helps us find ways that we can use our development skills to help the human parts of our products.\n\nListen to this developer's experiences playing support agent for a few hours each month, and how this turned into tools that made support a happier experience.\n\nEmily works for TeamSnap, where she helps write delightful software to organize teams, especially of the sports variety. She enjoys both the consumption and production of music and improv.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0Z/"
