title: 'DEF CON 23 - Sean Pierce - Abusing Native Shims for Post Exploitation'
language: English
recordingDate: 1451042115
description: "Shims offer a powerful rootkit-like framework that is natively implemented in most all modern Windows Operating Systems. This talk will focus on the wide array of post-exploitation options that a novice attacker could utilize to subvert the integrity of virtually any Windows application. I will demonstrate how Shim Database Files (sdb files / shims) are simple to create, easy to install, flexible, and stealthy. I will also show that there are other far more advanced applications such as in-memory patching, malware obfuscation, evasion, and system integrity subversion. For defenders, I am releasing 6 open source tools to prevent, detect, and block malicious shims.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nSean Pierce is a Technical Intelligence Analyst for iSIGHT Partners.
