description: "I love Ruby! But as in any relationship, to love means that you (often) have to accept the \"dark side\" too! Ruby is human in nature and has a lot of gotchas, tricks, weirdness and sometimes scary features that I plan to highlight. This talk aims to provide the \"Ah-ha!\" moments when working in Ruby.\n\nThis talk is for beginners and experts alike - in fact, I tag slides to mark their level and beginners can choose to tune out of the heavy stuff! My talk shall cover the dark side of the following features of Ruby (in no particular order)\n\nKeyword wierdness\nmethod missing\nModule inheritance! (huh?)\nAccessor righteousness\nCurried Procs for the hungry\nBase Conversions\nCherry picking module methods\nOniguruma games\nObject id weirdness\nprocs, blocks and our friend stabby.\n==, ===, eql? and equal?\nand more...\nAs with most of my talks, humor plays an important role and I shall aim to get everyone high on Ruby with a deep dive!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGZF/"
