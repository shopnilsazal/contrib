language: English

description: "Dan Palmer | Friday 16:30 | Room D\n\nOne of Django's strengths is the clear project layout that it gives you, but there is more to staying productive on a large codebase than the Django architecture. This talk will go into some of the design decisions we've made that have helped us remain productive as we've scaled to 300 Django apps with a development team of 5. Intermediate and beginner Django developers will likely get the most out of this talk."
