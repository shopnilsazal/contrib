description: "When attempting to solve our latest 367 hidden gems of ruby 1 9programming conundrum, we typically reach for the latest Ruby Gem that solves the problem for us. Oftentimes in our search for a solution, we neglect to look through some of the great libraries that come shipped with Ruby. In this talk we'll explore some of the tools we can use that don't require a gem install. We'll especially focus on the new toys in Ruby's standard library that ship with Ruby 1.9, but also look at some of the toys that ship with Ruby Classicâ„¢. Be prepared to be amazed and entertained.
