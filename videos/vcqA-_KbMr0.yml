description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2017 by Stanojko Markovik, ContentSquare.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-27\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/smarkovik/make-or-break\n\nThis talk will focus on automating the tedious tasks every team has. Everyone knows you should write clean code, unit test, and check for common bugs. But sometimes, it's hard... Sometimes you forget... Well in this talk we will focus on making it easier. How to automate the process, make your build servers do most of the stuff for you, and increase visibility of your tasks and their progress to your team. I will focus on both a setup for a new project, where you start from scratch and where you will want to keep the slate clean, but also for existing projects where you will want to pay your technical debt, a bit at a time, fixing your project, but also not disrupting your daily routine.\n\nType: Android development\nExperience: intermediate\n\nAlex Karp Production"
