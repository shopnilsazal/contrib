description: 'While microservice architectures allowed teams to scale delivery of independently deployable services, most frontend layers are still run as monolithic applications. Similar to server-side applications, frontend layers often grow into large monoliths that are difficult to maintain and evolve. The idea behind microfrontends is to enable multiple teams to work seamlessly together by fostering end-to-end ownership of independently deployable UIs. During this session you''ll learn how companies like OpenTable and Skyscanner rely on OpenComponents to deploy microfrontends architectures at scale.'
