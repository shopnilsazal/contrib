description: "View slide presentation here:\nhttp://blaze.pydata.org/presentations/pydata-nyc-2014.html\nNotebooks here: http://blaze.pydata.org/presentations/\n\nPyData NYC 2014\nBlaze is a NumPy/Pandas interface to big data systems like SQL, HDFS, and Spark. Blaze provides Python developers access to the rich analytic processing available both within the Python ecosystem and beyond.\n\nInternally Blaze is a lightweight data modeling language (expressions with type information) alongside a set of interpreters (Python, SQL, Spark, MongoDB, ...). The modeling language provides an intuitive and familiar user experience. The interpreters connect that experience to a wide variety of data technologies. This combination allows developers to construct connections to novel technologies. These connections enable users to interact with their system of choice, regardless if that system is a single CSV file or a large HDFS cluster running Impala.\n\nThis is followed by a second talk using Blaze in the wild."
