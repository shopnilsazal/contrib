description: "Keynote: Kubernetes: Finally...A True Cloud Platform - Sam Ghods, Co-founder, Box\n\n\"Kubernetes is often perceived as \"\"just another\"\" container orchestration framework. But the Kubernetes API has its design rooted in more than 10 years of experience with Borg and was explicitly designed to not be specific to Kubernetes - instead, it's a generic way to describe your entire application infrastructure.\n\nThis is the first time that we have had a universal interface that we can build real deployment tooling against. We'll talk about what this means for managing applications in the cloud and what opportunities it presents to those who wish to build the future of cloud infrastructure.\"\n\nAbout Sam Ghods\nSam Ghods is a cofounder and Services Architect at Box, where he is responsible for service infrastructure. Prior to his current role, Sam led software architecture at Box for eight years as Vice President of Technology. Previously, he was an engineer and cofounder at two startups."
