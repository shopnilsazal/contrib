description: "Jeff Bryner - Google Toolbar: The NARC Within\nYou downloaded google toolbar because it came with Adobe, or you are a a Google fanboy. You started using it to store your bookmarks because you're too lame to rsync them like real man. Little do you know that google is selling you out to your corporate security staff. They now know about the midget porn...the porn you bookmarked at home, but never view at work. Yes *that* porn\n\nJeff Bryner has 20 years of experience integrating systems, fixing security issues, performing incident response and forensics. He writes for the SANS forensic blog ,has spoken at RSA on SCADA security issues and runs p0wnlabs.com just for fun.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
