description: "G. Mark Hardy - Tales from the Crypto\nLearn how to crack crypto contests like a pro. The speaker has awarded half a dozen free round-trip plane tickets to previous contest winners. Maybe you'll be next. From the daily newspaper puzzle to badge contests to codes that keep the National Security Agency awake at night, it all comes down to intuition, perspiration, and math skillz.\n\nG. Mark Hardy has been providing information security expertise to government, military, and commercial clients for over 25 years. His professional background includes information security planning and policy development, managing security assessment and penetration teams, data encryption and authentication (including \"breaking\" commercial cryptographic algorithms), software development and strategic planning for e-commerce, and writing commercial risk assessment software. He has developed information security plans for four U.S. Military commands, and wrote the communications security encryption requirements for an experimental military satellite program. He just retired from the Navy reserves, so you can no longer spot him as a Fed.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
