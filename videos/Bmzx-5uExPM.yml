description: "Loki: An OpenSource Zipkin / Prometheus Mashup, Written in Go [I] - Tom Wilkie, Weaveworks\n\nIn this talk I'll present a prototype OpenTracing implementation dubbed \"Loki\". Loki is a Zipkin-compatible distributed tracer written in Go. Unlike Zipkin, Loki pulls traces from the application under examination by reusing Prometheus' service discovery and scraping code. This presents some unique advantages over traditional distributed tracers as the tracer knows the identify of the services under examination, and helps present a consistent naming topology when used with Prometheus.\n\nAbout Tom Wilkie\nTom is a Software Engineer at Weaveworks. Previously he was at Google as a Site Reliability Manager for Google Analytics. Before that he was Founder, VP Eng and CTO at Acunu, and before that a Software Engineer at XenSource. In his spare time, Tom likes to make craft beer and build home automation systems - and distributed tracers!"
