description: "RubyConf 2016 - Seeing Metaprogramming and Lambda Function Patterns in Ruby by Lukas Nimmo\n\nMetaprogramming and lambda functions in Ruby should be explained within their rightful place: living examples. You may have read tutorials on what these concepts are, but still do not understand when or why to use them. I dredged through over 50 prominent Open Source Ruby projects to bring you ten successful patterns that are used time and time again to create some of the most expressive and popular Ruby DSLs. Join me as we cover these patterns so that you can immediately begin using them in your own code to implement powerful DSLs. No vacuum-living, esoteric concepts here."
