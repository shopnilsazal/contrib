description: 'Portia: it''s a new tool we have written at SpiderLabs to aid in internal penetration testing test engagements. The tool allows you to supply a username and password that you have captured and cracked from Responder or other sources as well as an IP ranges, subnet or list of IP addresses. The tool finds its way around the network and attempts to gain access into the hosts, finds and dumps the passwords/hashes, reuses them to compromise other hosts in the network. In short, the tool helps with lateral movements in the network and automating privilege escalation as well as find sensitive data residing in the hosts.'
