description: "Network Service Agreement (SLA) System for Container Network - Yan Sun & Xuefeng Han, Huawei\n\nWith the proliferation of cloud services and the development of fine-grained virtualization techniques, the Network Service Agreement(SLA) requires to manage network resources efficiently for the large-scale, high-density computing units. Specifically, providing guaranteed Service Level Agreement for networking has been a challenge because of the high complexity between computing nodes. SLA Monitoring also plays an important role in classical SLA management model. We propose an efficient Networking Service Level Agreement system with an efficient topology-based feedback monitoring system, which provides dynamic networking SLA feedback such as Bandwidth, latency and packet drop rate, and adjustment will be based on them. The proposed solution, targeting at a general and robust design, keeps minor modification to the Cloud Management System and is verified by prototype implementation. The preliminary evaluations show that the proposed SLA scheduling is promising in terms of networking resource utilization, and can achieve higher performance compared with naive scheduling.\n\nAbout Yan Sun\nYan Sun is a Staff Research Engineer in Huawei Network Virtualization team based in Santa Clara, California.  His primary interest areas are networking acceleration and cloud computing. Yan holds a Ph.D in computer science and has published more than 30 papers."
