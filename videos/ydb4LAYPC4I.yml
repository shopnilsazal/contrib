description: "By Phil Cohen\n\nWe use Chef to manage a large and rapidly growing infrastructure at Shopify. Our cookbooks are open to development not only by our Operations Team, but by all 200+ developers at the company, and we manage to maintain an environment of continuous delivery and continuous improvement for our infrastructure. I'll talk about some of our workflows, internal tooling, and security considerations when operating at our scale.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2U/"
