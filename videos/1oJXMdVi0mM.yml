description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nReveal Your Deepest Kubernetes Metrics - Bob Cotton, Freshtracks.io (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nKubernetes generates a wealth of metrics. Some explicitly within the Kubernetes API server, the Kublet, and cAdvisor or implicitly by observing events such as the kube-state-metrics project. A subset of these metrics are used within Kubernetes itself to make scheduling decisions, however, other metrics can be used to determine the overall health of the system or for capacity planning purposes. Kubernetes exposes metrics from several places, some available internally, others through add-on projects. In this session you will learn about:- Node level metrics, as exposed from the node_exporter - Kublet metrics- API server metrics- etcd metrics- cAdvisor metrics- Metrics exposed from kube-state-metrics in this session to learn about how these metrics are calculated, their use within Kubernetes scheduling decisions and application in monitoring, alerting and capacity planning.\n\nAbout Bob\nBob Cotton is a co-founder of FreshTracks.io, a Kubernetes and Prometheus focused monitoring startup. Mr. Cotton bleeds observability based on 22 years designing, architecting, building and running distributed SaaS solutions. Infrastructure and application metrics, full-stack distributed tracing and big-data data analysis pipelines are his tools of choice to provide insight into all aspects of the business."
