description: "By, Vipul A Prathamesh S\n\nActiveRecord can't do it? Arel can! Active Record is awesome. But how does ActiveRecord handle generating complex SQL queries? Under the hood it's handled by Arel. Most of the time, Rails developers don't have to know about how Arel works. But sometimes Active Record can't satisfy our needs.
