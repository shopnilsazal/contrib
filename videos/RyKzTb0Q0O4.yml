description: "Enter the Matrix, Exploring Your Kubernetes Cluster in Virtual Reality - Ryan Vanniekerk, Lonely Planet\n\nThis is a combination of fun hack + potentially real-world use-case (sometime in the future).   The idea is to use WebVR and a Kubernetes API client to render a Kubernetes cluster in a Virtual Reality environment.  I will demonstrate interacting with different resources (inside of VR), including starting / terminating pods.   \n\nAbout Ryan vanniekerk\nDevOps engineer with 5+ years experience. | | Well-versed in Docker, solid foundation with Kubernetes, working with AWS since 2011."
