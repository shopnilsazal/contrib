description: "Copy of the slides for this talk are here: https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Cannon/DEFCON-20-Cannon-Into-The-Droid.pdf\n\nInto the Droid: Gaining Access to Android User Data\nThomas Cannon Director of Research and Development, viaForensics\n\nThis talk details a selection of techniques for getting the data out of an Android device in order to perform forensic analysis. It covers cracking lockscreen passwords, creating custom forensic ramdisks, bypassing bootloader protections and stealth real-time data acquisition. We'll even cover some crazy techniques - they may get you that crucial data when nothing else will work, or they may destroy the evidence!\n\nForensic practitioners are well acquainted with push-button forensics software. They are an essential tool to keep on top of high case loads - plug in the device and it pulls out the data. Gaining access to that data is a constant challenge against sophisticated protection being built into modern smartphones. Combined with the diversity of firmware and hardware on the Android platform it is not uncommon to require some manual methods and advanced tools to get the data you need.\n\nThis talk will reveal some of the techniques forensic software uses behind the scenes, and will give some insight into what methods and processes blackhats and law enforcement have at their disposal to get at your data. Free and Open Source tools will be released along with this talk to help you experiment with the techniques discussed.\n\nNote that this talk does not discuss Android analysis basics such as how to use ADB or what the SDK is - it is assumed you know these or can easily look them up afterwards.\n\nThomas Cannon is the Director of Research and Development for viaForensics, a Chicago based digital forensics and security company. Thomas spends the majority of his time researching new mobile security, malware and forensics techniques and getting them into the hands of customers for commercial, research or military application. He conducts penetration testing and code analysis of mobile applications for clients in industries such as banking/finance and retail.\n\nThomas is known for his research on Android having published advisories for new vulnerabilities and demonstrated attacks on the platform as well as providing some early guides on reverse engineering Android applications. Thomas has spoken at international conferences and presented to law enforcement on the topic of mobile forensics. Thomas has had a number of articles published in industry magazines and also been interviewed on national news programmes regarding vulnerabilities in payment systems and mobile technology.\nTwitter: @thomas_cannon\nhttps://viaforensics.com\nhttp://thomascannon.net"
