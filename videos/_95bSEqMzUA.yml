title: 'Alexander Müller - Spatial Range Queries Using Python In-Memory Indices'
language: English
recordingDate: 1508768240
description: "When you’re working with a spatial dataset a common use case is that you need to get points of interests that are within a certain radius of a reference point, also know as spatial range queries. A standard solution for this problem is to use databases like MongoDB or Postgres which provided advanced spatial indexing capabilities. However, if you don’t have those capabilities available or you need to perform millions of queries and don’t want to add load to your production database, you need to explore other alternatives.\n\nThus, this talk will discuss a potential remedy for this problem by showing how to use python together with some available libraries (numpy, sklearn, rtree, geohash) to enable in-memory radius searches. We will dive into some implementation details and show which methods to use for which use cases, by benchmarking them against each other.\n\n****\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
