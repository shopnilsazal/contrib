title: 'A Rubyist''s Guide to the Canvas API by H. Dean Hudson'
recordingDate: 1344315648
description: "Have you ever wanted to get into 2D graphics programming without leaving the comfort of the open web? The 2D context in Canvas is supported in all modern desktop and mobile browsers, providing a rich set of primitives for data visualization, games, animations, and more.\n\nThis talk aims to get you up to speed on some of the basics for building Canvas-based games and apps that can integrate with a simple Ruby backend. We'll walk through render loops, double buffering, sprite sheets, caching (and other performance tips), pixel filters, and mouse interactivity. My goal is to give practicing rubyists the tools they need to build 2D graphic applications (ahem, GAMES!) in the browser.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGim/"
