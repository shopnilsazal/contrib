description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nBuilding ML Products With Kubeflow - Jeremy Lewi, Google & Stephan Fabel, Canonical (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nML researchers spend too much time building infrastructure to support their work. Kubeflow aims to solve that by using Kubernetes to build an open, scalable, and extensible platform for ML. Since our launch at Kubecon in December, Kubeflow has grown to a substantial Github community with over 2200 stars and contributors from companies across the Kubernetes ecosystem, including Red Hat, Canonical, Weaveworks, CoreOS, CaiCloud, Alibaba, NVidia and many more. In this talk, we discuss how Kubeflow enables machine learning workflows that are easy enough for anyone to deploy, and run anywhere Kubernetes runs. We will talk about our experience building Kubeflow by leveraging Kubernetes technologies like CRDs and ksonnet to build an extensible, community driven ecosystem. Finally, we will talk about how we are trying to grow the community around Kubeflow to continue evolving the platform.\n\nAbout Jeremy                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Jeremy Lewi is a co-founder and lead engineer at Google for the Kubeflow project, an effort to help developers and enterprises deploy and use ML cloud-natively everywhere. He's been building on Kubernetes since its inception starting with Dataflow and then moving onto Cloud ML Engine and now Kubeflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                                                     About Stephan                                                                   \nStephan Fabel is Product Manager for all things cloud at Canonical and has been working on enabling Kubeflow on Canonical’s Distribution of Kubernetes. Stephan has been working with OpenStack and Kubernetes for over four years and led some of the world’s most challenging cloud implementations."
