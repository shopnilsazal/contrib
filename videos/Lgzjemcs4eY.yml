description: "Vidéo tournée lors de BlendWebMix 2015 !\n\nFrameworks pass, design remains.\nConférencier : Dan North\n\nIt seems there is a new web framework or toolkit every 5 minutes. Modern web development reads like a recipe: Start with a base of backbone or knockout, angular or react. Add a little jQuery or sizzle, underscore or lodash. Flavour with CoffeeScript or Dart, TypeScript or PureScript. Decorate with bootstrap, semantic, YUI, LESS or SASS. Sieve through an asset pipeline then serve on a bed of HTML.\n\nHowever you bake your web app, there are enduring truths that apply to any application. How can you architect for change? What does your approach to design have to do with user experience? What do we mean by user experience anyway? In this talk Dan shares some advice about development, design and user experience that will probably outlast the latest round of web frameworks. As Coco Chanel might have said, frameworks pass, design remains."
