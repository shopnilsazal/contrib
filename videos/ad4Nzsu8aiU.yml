description: 'Deep Learning has been dominating recent machine learning competitions with better predictions. Unlike the neural networks of the past, modern Deep Learning methods have cracked the code for training stability and generalization. Deep Learning is not only the leader in image and speech recognition tasks, but is also emerging as the algorithm of choice for highest predictive performance in traditional business analytics. This talk introduces Deep Learning and implementation concepts in the open-source H2O in-memory prediction engine. Designed for the solution of business-critical problems on distributed compute clusters, it offers advanced features such as adaptive learning rate, dropout regularization, parameter tuning and a fully-featured R interface. World record performance on the classic MNIST dataset, best-in-class accuracy for a high-dimensional eBay text classification problem and other relevant datasets showcase the power of this game-changing technology. A whole new ecosystem of Intelligent Applications is emerging with Deep Learning at its core.'
