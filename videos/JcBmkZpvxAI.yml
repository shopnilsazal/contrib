recordingDate: 1494406910
description: "With security as one of its design fundamentals, Microsoft Edge browser is one of the most secure browsers around. How difficult is it to find remote code execution exploits in the Edge browser?\n\nTo answer this question we spent time researching various attack surfaces in the Edge browser and came away with an answer – go in through the ChakraCore engine.\n\nChakraCore is the core of Microsoft’s next generation Javascript Engine that powers Microsoft Edge. Since it is open sourced, we can manually audit the code. Our code auditing resulted in 20+ exploitable vulnerabilities and 10+ working exploits on Windows 10 and the 64-bit Edge browser.\n\nIn this presentation, we will first introduce some special characteristics (mostly new characteristics compared to  the old Internet Explorer JavaScript engine) of the ChakraCore engine where we can find exploitable vulnerabilities. With these exploitable vulnerabilities in hand, the next thing to do it to turn them into working exploits.\n\nWe will introduce some new exploit techniques based on the features of ChakraCore itself and show how to pull off reliable heap-fengshui in the Chakra engine. We will also introduce our unpublished CFG (control flow guard) bypass methods which won Microsoft’s mitigation bypass bounty reward and demonstrate how to bypass the newly added RFG (return flow guard) mitigation introduced in windows RS2 preview.\n\nAs a bonus, we will disclose the details of several real 64-bit edge exploits, including the one we used to win PwnFest 2016 (http://pwnfest.org/).\n\n=== \n\nLinan Hao (@holynop) is a security researcher from 360Vulcan Team (@360Vulcan). He has previously spoken at Blackhat EU/44CON. He is a member of the winning team from Qihoo of pwn2own2015, pwn2own2016 and pwnfest2016.  He used to be a Windows kernel developer and now focuses on vulnerability research having spent six years in the security industry.  His major interests include vulnerability hunting, exploiting and 0-day detection. He won the Microsoft Mitigation Bypass Bounty in 2015 and was listed in MSRC Top 100 for 2015/2016.\n\n--- \n\nLong Liu is a security researcher in 360Vulcan Team.  He has four years of experience in vulnerability digging & exploit research and has found 100+ vulnerabilities of IE, Edge and Chrome and has over 30+ CVEs to his name. He won the Microsoft Mitigation Bypass Bounty in 2016 and was MSRC Top 11 in 2016, MSRC Top 13 in 2015."
