description: "by Henrik Skupin and Dave Hunt\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nJoin us as we demonstrate how Mozilla are using Selenium to test Firefox byextending the WebDriver specification.\n\nSelenium is a popular tool for testing websites across multiple browsers, andwhen combined with Mozilla's implementation of the WebDriver specification, itbecomes possible to interact directly with Firefox itself. In this session,we'll show a simple approach to writing tests using Selenium in Python, andthen demonstrate how we're taking this further to replace our existingfunctional UI tests for Firefox. By using Selenium, we're hoping to makecontributing to these tests much easier for our community, and by pushing thetools to their limits we'll also make them rock solid.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 11:30:00"
