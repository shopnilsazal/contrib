description: "Sarah will first demo some games created with Pie. She will then talk about the Ruby language features that make it easy (possible) to create domain specific languages and how they are used in Pie. She will also cover design considerations... why certain syntax worked well and other early design choices turned out to be a bad idea.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GXlV/"
