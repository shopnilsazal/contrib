recordingDate: 1415985781
description: "By, Arjan van der Gaag \nI'm terrified that some day, someone will find out I'm not actually a good software developer. I was just faking it all along. I don't really belong here, among all these competent people. These are dangerous thoughts that will hinder creativity, confidence and lead to missed opportunities. Many people in many fields deal with impostor syndrome, but it's especially harmful to the software development community. This is a personal account of dealing with impostor syndrome as a software developer, a guide for dealing with it in development teams and a challenge to everybody else to have the courage to be awesome.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Faef/"
