description: "Wicked Good Ember 2015 - The Observer tip-jar by Stefan Penner\n\nAs an ember developer, we have a large collection of tools at our disposal. Sometimes it is tricky to know what the best tool is for a given task.\nLikely one of the most problematic ambiguities comes from the pair computed properties and observers. Existing ember docs and guides treat these concepts as equal pairs. It is even common for established ember developers to have details of the two confused.\nThis talk aims to clear up the confusion and demonstrate the blissful joy of an (nearly) observer free world.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Gmsy/"
