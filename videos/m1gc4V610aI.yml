description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2015 in San Francisco\nhttps://2015.appsecusa.org/\n\nCipher Text Says “MIID8zCCAtugAwIBAgIBAT” - Enterprise-wide SSL Automation w/Lemur + CloudCA \nContact - Kevin Glisson, Netflix, kglisson@netflix.com\n\nAbstract\nAt Netflix Security we try our best to enable developers by removing roadblocks and providing systems with “sane” defaults that keep everyone from shooting themselves in the foot. When dealing with SSL shooting yourself in the foot particularly important; self-signed, mismanaged or otherwise weak SSL certificates undermine SSL’s main purpose of providing confidentiality between systems. \n\nHow many times have you heard fellow engineers mutter “What openssl flag did I need again? -newkey? -newKey? rsa what?!” Lemur and CloudCA together provide a solution such that making and managing SSL certificates much easier for a normal developer. In both of these systems we guide developers toward making “good decisions” while enabling them to stand up SSL on more and more of their applications. More and stronger SSL?! Win!\n\nLemur and CloudCA are fully integrated with AWS. Lemur allows for certificate tracking of certificates already in AWS; uploading new CAs into AWS. Lemur event supports multiple AWS accounts! \n\nThis talk will focus on how Lemur + CloudCA helps Netflix increase and manage it’s use of SSL; how they enable developers and ultimately provide better security for Netflix as a whole.\n\nLemur and CloudCA are planned to be open sourced in Q2 of 2015.\n\nKevin Glisson\nSenior Cloud Security Engineer, Netflix\nWhen Kevin Glisson is not playing with security automation, new languages and python libraries he is an avid mountain biker and backpacker enjoying all parts of the Sierra's. Kevin is currently a Security Engineer at Netflix writing tools to help streamline security operations and make the cloud more approachable and secure.
