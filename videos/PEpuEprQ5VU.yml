title: 'DEF CON 23 - Runa Sandvik, Michael Auger - Hacking a Linux-Powered Rifle'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449194949
description: "TrackingPoint is an Austin startup known for making precision-guided firearms. These firearms ship with a tightly integrated system coupling a rifle, an ARM-powered scope running a modified version of Linux, and a linked trigger mechanism. The scope can follow targets, calculate ballistics and drastically increase its user's first shot accuracy. The scope can also record video and audio, as well as stream video to other devices using its own wireless network and mobile applications.\n\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate how the TrackingPoint long range tactical rifle works. We will discuss how we reverse engineered the scope, the firmware, and three of TrackingPoint's mobile applications. We will discuss different use cases and attack surfaces. We will also discuss the security and privacy implications of network-connected firearms.\n\nSpeaker Bios:\nRuna A. Sandvik is a privacy and security researcher, working at the intersection of technology, law and policy. She is a technical advisor to both the Freedom of the Press Foundation and the TrueCrypt Audit Project, and a member of the review board for Black Hat Europe.
