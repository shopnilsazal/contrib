recordingDate: 1474644862
description: "PyData Chicago 2016\n\nLast year, I created my first Flask-powered web application utilizing React.js and D3. I refactored it into reusable components and released it as Pyxley. In this talk, I’ll introduce the basics of Pyxley and discuss what has and hasn’t worked. More importantly, I’ll talk about what it’s like to maintain an open-source project for the first time."
