description: "Speaker : Alex Van Boxel\n\nNow that you have micro-services you want to keep an eye on what happens between the services and make sure everything is secure. Istio provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more, without requiring any changes in service code. Istio is an open-source collaboration between Lift, Google and IBM with Lift's Envoy at the core.\n\nYou will get a detailed overview of all the benefits that Istio can bring to your micro-service architecture. The presentation will be accompanied with a live demo giving more insight of some of the concepts."
