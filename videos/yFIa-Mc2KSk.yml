description: "I am a developer, and I have Type II BiPolar and ADHD.\nIt's not something we talk about, but BiPolar, depression, and ADHD runs rampant in the developer community - they tend to correlate with higher intelligence. Many of the symptoms of this conditions make for great developers, but also cause incredible damage. We recently lost one of our co-workers because of untreated mental illness.\nI want to share my story - and let people know that it's okay to talk about these things, that it's nothing to be ashamed of, and how to get help, and how to help those around them.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/CiiY/"
