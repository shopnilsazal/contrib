description: "Inside Ruby's VM: The TMI Edition. by Aaron Patterson\n\nThis is about Ruby's Virtual Machine. Specifically MRI's Virtual Machine. We will take a dive in to how your Ruby code is compiled in to byte code and how that byte code is executed. Once we get a grip on how the VM works, we'll see how to make it perform tricks the likes of which you've never seen! Ok, maybe you have seen them, just not with MRI's virtual machine."
