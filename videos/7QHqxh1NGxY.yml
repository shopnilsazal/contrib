description: "Pawel Kozlowski from the AngularJS team held this talk at Web Rebels 2013\nThis talk will familiarize you with AngularJS JavaScript framework and its revolutionary approach to writing single-page web applications. AngularJS is unique in many ways with its DOM-based, declarative templating, ability to extend HTML vocabulary and strong focus on testing.\nAngularJS will be introduced by contrasting it with traditional approaches and showing benefits of the AngularJS-way (extremely concise yet readable code, testability and most importantly â€“ making web development fun again!). This will be an interactive talk with plenty of code examples."
