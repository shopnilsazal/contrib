Recently, our right to share files online has been under assault by governments, corporations, and others who fear openness and personal privacy rights. People have been persecuted, fined, and even imprisoned for simply sharing data electronically. As private conversations transition from the home to the web, we're losing our fundamental rights to privacy and personal beliefs.\n\nWhile many of us believe that information should be and can be freely shared, we are not without blame. As experts in our fields we have at our disposal an arsenal of tools, experience, and technologies to open up the Internet for limitless file sharing without fear of retribution or loss of personal privacy and freedom. Saving cyberspace means that there are times when we need to break the mold of old and stale thinking – creating something new and beautiful that has the power to change the world.\n\nThis presentation is a free data manifesto, a historical analysis, and a recipe for creating a new approach to file sharing that's free from snooping, intervention, and interruption from all outside entities. If you've ever been concerned about the risks and insecurity of file sharing, make sure to attend. Understanding our right to share is the first step to changing the world.\n\nEijah is a Senior Programmer at a world-renowned game development studio.
