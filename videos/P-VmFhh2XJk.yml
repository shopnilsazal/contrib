title: 'Chacko Daniel: Service Fabric Mesh'

description: "Chacko Daniel is a Principal Program Manager on the Service Fabric team, a role he's held for several years. He's been leading the charge towards a fully managed microservices platform built on top of Service Fabric, named Service Fabric Mesh. Fully managed means there is no infrastructure management required: you don't manage clusters of VMs, you build containerized applications and deploy them to the cloud. Service Fabric takes care of all the infrastructure management, scaling, resourcing, provisioning, allocation, distribution, etc... You focus on what matters most, your application. \n\nHow did we arrive at Service Fabric Mesh? What's the thinking behind the thinking? How does it work (we will dig deeper in subsequent conversations with engineers building the system)? What's the plan for stateful container management? What's next?\n\nTune in. This is a great introduction to the newest member of the Service Fabric family, Service Fabric Mesh. And of course, meet Chacko. \n\nSign up for the SF Mesh Preview: http://aka.ms/sfmeshpreview\n\nLearn more:\n\nService Fabric at Build 2018: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-service-fabric-at-microsoft-build-2018/\n\nBuild 2018:\n\nService Fabric the road ahead: https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2018/BRK2111\n\nContainers and microservices: Zero to Hero with Service Fabric:\nhttps://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2018/THR2047"
