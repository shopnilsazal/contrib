description: "\"Design patterns\" is a common phrase that is often spoken in the course of design and development of web applications. But it's genesis is not from programming, but Architecture. They come from a trio of books in the 1970s by Christopher Alexander, the most famous of which is the middle book: \"A Pattern Language\". The issue arises that Pattern Languages, much like spoken languages, are most effective when the speaker is fluent.\nWe'll look at the origin of pattern languages and why they can be dangerous and even detrimental tools in the hands of the inexperienced designer and developer through examples of bad grammar and poor idiomatic choices(aka antipatterns), and perhaps some architecture as well.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2J/"
