description: 'Web development is easy and fun with Haskell... and of course, type safe! Let''s take a birds-eye tour on creating a web application in Haskell from scratch, from the initial project creation to deployment in the cloud. By the end of the workshop, you will have deployed a small server for note-taking. The workshop is divided in four slots, each dealing with a different facet of web development. First of all, simple routing and building of HTML to be returned to the clients. Then, adding database capabilities using Persistent and Esqueleto. The next step is taking input from the user via digestive functors. Finally, deployment to Heroku will be considered, along with integrating other middleware in your application.'
