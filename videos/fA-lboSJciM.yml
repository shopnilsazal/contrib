Building solutions that serve all of your customers will become increasingly more important.\n\nIn this updated version of the talk, we will explore emerging use cases, technical challenges, and social challenges you will encounter when serving these markets. You will walk away with guidelines to write globally inclusive applications in order to make a broader global impact.\n\nSpeaker: Corey Leigh Latislaw, Off Grid Electric\n\n#droidconDE – cc-by-sa 3.0"
