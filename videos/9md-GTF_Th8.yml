description: "Self-documenting code is a pipe dream. TDD (or BDD) is not the panacea of testing. In the pursuit of test coverage we've forgotten what really matters: getting things done. Lets talk about putting documentation and testing into their proper place. Tools that ease maintenance, help other developers join a project, and reduce bugs.\nI'm going to go over lessons learned in writing, maintaining, and introducing new developers to 20,000 lines of code. Specifically, how we are testing, documenting, and refactoring our code to stay sane, make the team happier, and get more done.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGah/"
