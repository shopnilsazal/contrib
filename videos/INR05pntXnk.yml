description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2015/bodil-stokke\n\nWhy isn't Erlang more popular? This question keeps coming up, and the community keeps proposing answers – most of which are so far off target they just make the situation worse. Bodil examines the state of affairs, offers a widely travelled outsider's perspective, and boldly proposes solutions which could very well make the situation even worse. Finally, she attempts to tackle the real question: what's to be gained by being popular anyway?\n\n\nBodil is a a bishop of the Greater London diocese of the Church of Emacs, and a compulsive conference speaker in the fields of functional programming and internets technologies, and is a co-organiser of multiple developer conferences in Scandinavia and the UK, mostly because she’s still learning how to stop. Her favourite pony is Pinkie Pie."
