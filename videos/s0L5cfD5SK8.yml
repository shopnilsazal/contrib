recordingDate: 1391561507
description: "Atlas: Remedial Heap Overflows: dlmalloc style\nSometimes even the top dudes need a refresher course. Remedial Heap Overflows is not so much a lesson to the lame, but a refresher for the leet. One day the speaker was approached (in a subway, of course) by a top-notch dude (who has his own posse) and asked how they work. Clearly not even the best of the best always know everything.\n\natlas, a disciple of the illustrious Skodo, has a history in programming, systems support, telecom, security, and reverse engineering. His introduction to the hard-core hacking world was through dc13's CTF Qualifiers. atlas won the individual contest in 2005 and lead the winning team \"1@stplace\" in 2006. atlas has written the WEP-cracking tool bssid-flatten, the @Utility-Belt (toolkit for hacking and exploitation), and his favorite tool, disass."
