description: "weasel: The Plausible Deniability Toolkit\n\nAbstract: The Plausible Deniability Toolkit is a collection of processes and tools designed to protect its users from invasions of privacy and infringement of civil rights by oppresive organizations and governments. The foundation for this toolkit is the result of anti-forensics gap analysis and the need for fabrication of evidence. Certainly most of these techniques have been in use by child pornography rings and various governmental TLA's, but we intend to bring them forward for more legitimate usages, such as protecting civil activist and whistleblowers. This presentation will consist of a walkthough of the gaps left behind by anti-forensics techniques, as well as describe the technologies and techniques used by the toolkit. We will aslo cover live demonstrations of the tools and their uses as well as allow plenty of flexibility for audience interaction. And if there it time left at the end, we will do a live hacking of Jeff Moss' bank accounts. \n\nBio: Nomad Mobile Research Centre (NMRC) is a hacker collective, and has been around since 1996. NMRC has released numerous papers, advisories, FAQs, and tools over the years, and believes that hackers have something good to give to society.Unfortunately most of the world doesn't believe in their definition of \"good\". NMRC has distinguished itself in the realm of hackerdom in the following ways over other hacker groups: 1) They maintain friends of all hat colors; 2) They were the first hacker group to spell Centre with an \"e\" on the end; and 3) They live to hack and hack to live, unless of course they find free pr0n."
