description: "Using Rust from C... or Any Language by Yehuda Katz\n\nOne of the best things about Rust is how easy it is to integrate Rust with applications or libraries written in C. But while Rust provides all of the tools you need to get the job done, getting started with the FFI APIs can be tricky. To make matters worse, this kind of Rust programming is full of unsafe code.\n\nIn this talk, I will cover the basics of using Rust from C (and vice versa), based on over a year of writing production Rust code that makes heavy use of FFI bindings.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Gx20/"
