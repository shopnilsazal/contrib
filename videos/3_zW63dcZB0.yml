description: "Have you ever had flying dreams? Or dreams that all of a sudden you finally understood it \"all\"? These feelings are echoed in the joy we experience in learning, discovering, and creating as software developers.\nThis talk will explore and celebrate this precious and fragile joy. We will look at ways to enhance it and avoid things that threaten to squash it. In particular, we see how it binds us all together as a community and how we can nurture it in each other.\n\nby Carin Meier (@gigasquid) and Sam Aaron (@samaaron)\n\nCarin started off as a professional ballet dancer, studied Physics in college, and has been developing software for both the enterprise and entrepreneur ever since. She has a thing for Clojure and can be usually found with a cup of tea in her hand, hacking on her Roomba and AR Parrot Drone.;Sam is a live coder and strongly believes in the importance of emphasising and exploring and celebrating creativity within all aspects of programming. He is the lead developer of Overtone a live coding music environment in Clojure, Quil a Clojure front-end to Processing and Sonic Pi a beginners music live coding environment used to teach programming within schools. Sam is also one half of the live coding duo Meta-eX."
