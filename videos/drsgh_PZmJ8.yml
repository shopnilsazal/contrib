title: 'DEF CON 23 - Wireless Village - Balint Seeber - SIGINT & Blind Signal Analysis w/ GNU Radio & SDR'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449274814
description: "The workshop will cover many common techniques used to reverse engineer the physical layer of a wireless communications system:\n\n- Blind signal analysis on a signals re-broadcast from a satellite transponder: modulation type, order, symbol rate, error correction,scrambling, differential coding, visualization\n- Applying auto-correlation to interesting signals on the HF band: RADAR, OFDM, symbol timing\n- Frequency hopping: wide-band, real-time spectrum visualization\nAll with GNU Radio!\nParticipants are advised to bring their own SDR to receive signals with, and have the very latest version of GNU Radio installed, and if they can manage also the gr-baz out-of-tree module.\n\nSignal fundamentals\nProperties that can be exploited for blind signal analysis\nModulation schemes\nPeriodicity in symbols\nRepetition in frames\nBursty vs. continuous signals\nTechniques\nAuto-correlation\nCyclostationary analysis\nDecoding\nDemodulation\nCommon additions: scrambling, error correction\nDe-framing\nChecksums\nEnhancements (briefly)\nDirection Finding\nPhysical layer fingerprinting\nAdvanced SDR with USRPs\nBurst mode\nArbitrary sample rates\nDigital tuning\nFrequency hopping"
