AT&T: Your World, Delivered (to the NSA)\n\nAbstract: If you want to know how the National Security Agency and telecommunications companies are conspiring to invade your privacy, this is the panel for you. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is currently suing AT&T for collaborating with the NSA in its massive and illegal program to wiretap and data-mine Americans' phone and internet communications. Come learn about the legal and technical issues surrounding the NSA surveillance program, find out what Congress is (or isn?t) doing about it, and get an up-to-the-minute update from the EFF lawyers on their lawsuit and other NSA-related court cases across the country."
