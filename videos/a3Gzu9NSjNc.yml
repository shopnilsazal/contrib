This talk will explore the vulnerabilities and exposures of virtually all pin-tumbler locks, highlighting the legal issues surrounding the possession and use of bump-keys and bumping implements. Case examples and demonstrations detailing a major security flaw and vulnerability in locks used by the federal government and a private sector corporation that affect millions of users will be presented. \n\nBio: Marc Weber Tobias is an Investigative Attorney and polygraph examiner in the United States.
