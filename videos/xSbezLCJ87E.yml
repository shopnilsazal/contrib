description: "\"Python Packaging - current state and overview\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - PythonAnywhere Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nHistorically, Python packaging has been a source of significant pain for even the most devoted Python enthusiasts. I've found myself in the situation, where I did know the basic concepts behind the tools, but despite that only thing I could do was following tutorials. That was the time to change it and that's the reason this presentation was written.\n\nIn this talk, I'll provide a quick overview of the current state of Python packaging tools. I'll mostly focus on setuptools, pip and wheels, putting an emphasis on their superiority over their precursors. I'll also list down the honorable mentions of tools worth knowing. Then I'll share examples of how you can use the features of the Setuptools library - those well known and those we use when pip-installing packages, but most of us can't name them.\n\nThe point of this presentation is to explain how to use tools which are all there, just waiting to make developing, testing, and distributing our Python packages easier. Doesn't matter if you're a Python expert or a beginner - the knowledge covered by this presentation will be useful despite your level.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
