description: "CodeDaze 2016 - A Handy Look at Hanami by jason Charnes\n\nCodeDaze was a two day conference in Buffalo, NY to examine the art of Code, Design, Data, and Community. The venue, in the historic Hotel Lafayette, was a warm and welcome place. That said, some the audio on these videos is less than stellar due to the difficulties of modern audio systems in historic places. Confreaks has done the best job possible cleaning up the sound."
