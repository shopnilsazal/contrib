description: "by Olivier Hallot \n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nCurrently the LibreOffice help system is based on a technology developed circa2005, and uses the internal Writer - Web module to display its contents. Thispresentation introduces our efforts to bring the LibreOffice Help system intoa modern 2017 technology, preserving our legacy contents and l10n processes.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCurrently the LibreOffice help system, here forth called HC2 is based on atechnology developed circa 20051, and uses the internal Writer - Web module todisplay its contents. HC2 uses a combination of XML and XLST technology todisplay contents in Writer/Web and is historically bounded to HTML version 3.2. As a consequence, the HC2 misses multimedia resources such as videos,animations as well as a modernized concept of CSS and Javascript for betteruser experience.\n\nFurther, the HC2 XML schema (XHP) requires special tools (HelpAuthoring) forediting its contents and a simple inspection on the schema indicates most ofits elements are now part of W3C standard HTML5, turning XHP almost obsolete.Current help authoring tools are buggy and requires steep learning curve forthe unskilled volunteers.\n\n## History of LibreOffice XML Help\n\nLibreOffice Help System was designed and implemented in 2005 by SUNMicrosystems ant the times where the \"Browswer war\" raged and no standardpublished by W3c was adopted in full by the major browser players. The WWWhijack by major corporations was played in the browser battlefield, twistingspecs and invalidating page rendering to build fences around browsers andservers and creating silos of web display technologies;\n\nSUN Microsystem adopted an internal only solution, with a A specific XML (XHP)to hold contents and navigation and an internal browser (Writer Web), thatbeared a resticted HTML 3.2 specification, together with a C++ wrapper tocreate index and proper calls\n\n## 2017 issues for Help System\n\nThe current (2005) help system is in a state that is is complex edit/updatecontents, hard to test and visualize results. There is no rich text availableexcept an authoring extension to LibreOffice that uses Writer as rich texteditor but has several issues in exportng and importing xhp files. To use thisextension features is as hard as learning XHP itself and as hard as to attemptto edit content with a simple text editor as vim or emacs.\n\nFurthemore the rich text authoring is bounded to the current XHP schema,doubling the effort when it comed to evolove XHP, because the tools mustfollow the new schema.\n\nThe current HTML 3.2 implemetation with LibreOffice Writer / Web rendereingengine, is also bounded to simple images and text, and no video nor anothermultimedia resource is avalable for the user.\n\n## General requirements\n\nThe new help system for LibreOffice must support important requirements\n\nIt must preserve legacy contents, composed into thousands of XHP filescovering all 6 LibreOffice modules and an internal user guide.\n\nIt must also preserve the dozens of translations done on these legacy XHPfiles and the translation process must be ideally preserved or incur in theleast perturbation possible.\n\nIt must use open, royalty free standars of web technologies, supoort all majorbrowsers of 2017, OS independent.\n\nIt must be of easy access, low entry barrier for newbies, volunteers an havesupport of ease of use editing tools.\n\nIt must be perfectly handled by git version control\n\nIt must work Off-line and on-line\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe strategy of the project is in 2 pieces\n\n1) Progressively phase out XHP and phase-in HTML5\n\nHTML5 is a serious candidate to deserve our efforts to bring back our hepcontent into a general purpose rendering technology, suport moder CSS,javascript, other companion technologies\n\n2) Develop a micro javascript server capable of\n\n  * Display the correct help page required by the LibreOffce applicaiton  * Use most of the resources such as navigation history, bookmarking, caching incluced in any major browser  * Handle indexing and searching text among pages  * support XHP and HTML simultaneously\n\n## Demo\n\nWe will demo where we are at the moment\n\n## Concusions\n\nPart of the cost of a technology adoption is its capability to be quicklyabsorbed by its target audiences. Documentation and help systems plays a keyrole for the adoption of LibreOffice not only in the home but also in thecorporations. Having a dynamic and rich help content that can make users feelthe better experience in seeking help is a key step LibreOffice project istaking to inclrease its popularity. The project described here is our currentstatus and will be real very soon.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 11:30:00"
