This is often not worth it - 95% of users don't change settings, so the choice that you're giving users is an illusion. Be careful about adding settings, and always try to design around it, or just making the default the one and only option (because in practice it very nearly is anyway).\n\nðŸ”—  MPJ's Musings series\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRsyY0kzXfw&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeH21VDycWYNWU7VKUA-xLzg\n\nðŸ”—  \"Let's code an editor\" series\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HfAdeoq97k&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeHgdv6t242ukQNIOtHNgzOJ\n\nðŸ”— mpj on Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/mpjme\n\nðŸ”— Music: Peacock by 7 minutes dead \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi-xOhMqrkg"
