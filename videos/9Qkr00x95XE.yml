description: "What makes data science such a different field ? Why is it such a challenge to structure, manage and capture the value of data science ?\nThis presentation will focus on the key issues around the practice of discovery, (“science”) and how it differs from the practice of building new things (“engineering”).\nOther questions addressed will include:\nHow do organisations manage and leverage the value of data science ? What are the key “unknown unknowns” that managers miss so often, with disastrous results ?\nWhat are the cultural, procedural, managerial differences between “scientists” and engineers in a modern, data-driven workplace ?\n\nDr Eugene Dubossarsky is a leader in the analytics field in Australia, with 20 years’ commercial data science experience. He is the head of the Sydney Data Science group (4,000+ members), the Sydney Users of R Forum (SURF, 1,500+ members), and Datapreneurs(500+ members). He is regularly invited to be a conference presenter, consultant and advisor, and appears in print and on television to discuss data science and analytics.\n\nEugene also applies data science in an entrepreneurial setting, to financial trading and online startups, and is the creator of ggraptR, an interactive visualisation package in R.\n\nFor more on YOW!
