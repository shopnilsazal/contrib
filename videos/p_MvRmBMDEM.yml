description: "\"Copacetic\", by David N. Blank-Edelman, Northeastern University College of Computer and Information Science\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this video are those of the speaker(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the USENIX Association.**\r\n\r\nDuring a hiring search, I talked to far too many sysadmins who wanted to use best practices at their workplace (configuration management, DevOps techniques, etc.) but felt personally disempowered to do anything but fight fires or perpetuate the current environment, as well as to those who had lost the enjoyment of working in our field. Some of these unhappy souls were managers; some of them were managed. These interactions harshed my mellow so much that I became determined to find a way to extract them from both their internal and their external mire. There's fabulous research being done on the nature of happiness, motivation, and reality hacking that is directly applicable to our field. Come to this talk to learn some surprising but practical ways to improve your happiness or the happiness of sysadmins/DevOps who work for you."
