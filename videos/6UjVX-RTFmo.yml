description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nIntegrating Prometheus and InfluxDB - Paul Dix, InfluxData (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nMany Prometheus users would like a long term store of record for their data. InfluxDB can fill this role with recent additions to add support for Prometheus standards and protocols. This talk will show how InfluxDB supports the pull and Prometheus metrics formats. We'll look at Prometheus' remote/read and write interfaces and how those can be used to integrate with InfluxDB. Finally, we'll dig into InfluxDB's new open source query engine, which will allow Prometheus users to perform federated queries against any number of Prometheus and InfluxDB servers. This talk will also show how other monitoring projects can adopt the Prometheus standards to play in the larger ecosystem to give developers more tools for their Kubernetes and application monitoring needs.\n\n\"About Paul\nPaul is the creator of InfluxDB. He has helped build software for startups, large companies and organizations like Microsoft, Google, McAfee, Thomson Reuters, and Air Force Space Command. He is the series editor for Addison Wesley’s Data & Analytics book and video series. In 2010 Paul wrote the book Service Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails for Addison Wesley’s.
