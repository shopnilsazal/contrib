description: "Kenneth Geers - Live Fire Exercise: Baltic Cyber Shield 2010\nIn May, 2010, the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Estonia and the Swedish National Defence College hosted the Baltic Cyber Shield (BCS) international cyber defense exercise (CDX). For two days, six Blue Teams from northern European government, military and academic institutions defended simulated power generation companies against a Red Team of twenty hostile computer hackers. The scenario described a volatile geopolitical environment in which newly hired network security personnel were immediately forced to defend Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) from cyber attacks sponsored by a non-state, terrorist group. This presentation covers the origin and evolution of CDXs and it describes the design, goals, and lessons learned from\nBCS 2010.\n\nKenneth Geers works for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), and is the U.S. Representative to the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD CoE) in Tallinn, Estonia. He has served as an intelligence analyst, a French and Russian linguist, and computer programmer in support of arms control initiatives. Kenneth has published strategic and technical papers on the growing connection between computer security and national security. He is a PhD student at the Tallinn University of Technology, and is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
