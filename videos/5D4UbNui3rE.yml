description: "RSpec, like it or loathe it is a widely used testing framework and this year will reach it's latest major version. Version 3. Why is this a big deal?\n\nIt's the product of many months of work by the core team and makes a lot of changes to improve its code base both internally and externally. Some of the changes are contentious and some are just cool, but why did we make those decisions?\n\nLet me take you thought the major changes in RSpec3 and detail why we took that decision you don't like, why did we deprecate that feature or why do we recommend this way of doing things. Hopefully you'll be encouraged to write better specs or maybe just understand this little piece of the Ruby ecosystem a bit better.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGYa/"
