title: 'Droidcon Itay 2017 // Better Android Intents with Dart & Henson - Stephane Nicolas'
recordingDate: 1491643391
description: "Intents are an essential component of the Android ecosystem. They are used to express an action to be performed and can be classified into implicit and explicit intents. In an abstract way, all intents together define a navigation layer inside an application. Dart & Henson can generate all the code you need to create a clean navigation layer in your Android apps.\n\nDuring this talk we will explain why the Android way to create explicit intents is error-prone and also show some problematic ways to solve it. Then, we will introduce the solution we developed at Groupon: Henson, a new library in the Dart project, that takes intent creation to new levels: It generates a fluent API to build intents. This API constitutes a navigation layer that makes it easy, convenient, fast and robust to navigate among your activities and services. Therefore, it will be impossible to miss a required extra and simple to add optional arguments as needed.\n\nThe talk will be based on the following article featured by Android Weekly:\n\nhttps://medium.com/groupon-eng/better-android-intents-with-dart-henson-1ca91793944b#.4h12yxgtl\n\nFurthermore, all the library features and possibilities will be explained in depth.\n\nThis intermediate level talk about Dart & Henson will be carried out using slides, code and demos."
