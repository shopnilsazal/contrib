But why would you choose JRuby? What benefits does it offer?\n\nIn this talk, we will introduce you to the wonderful world of JRuby. After basic setup, we'll show how JRuby's concurrency model and GC can help boost performance. We'll walk through deploying and scaling apps and services on JRuby. We'll demonstrate JRuby's powerful integration with other JVM languages. And we'll talk about how to start migrating to or building new apps on JRuby. Join us and learn what JRuby can do for you!"
