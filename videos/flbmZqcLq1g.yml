description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2013ams/materials/ \n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\n\nPhrack and other magazines used to be full of obscure hardware and systems descriptions for telecom equipment that were the pride and the thrill of many dark-corner hackers. There's a specific kink about these strange OS, protocols and interfaces. But sadly (or not, as we'll see), it's a gone era. Gone are the DMS100, the DX200, the COSMOS switches and other telecom legacy beauty, ahem, well, at least it SHOULD BE GONE.\n\nToday, we're entering the realm of LTE super high speed always-on connectivity and with that comes the victory of TCP/IP in front of the old ITU/3GPP protocols. And with this comes many side effects: software gets standardized, everything runs on top of ATCA (Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture) hardware running mostly Linux -give or take 6 or 8 proprietary FPGA-based sister cards, TFTP-booted with decade old VxWorks that routinely show hardcoded DES credentials and funny \"behaviour\". Easily 20 GB of fat C++ binaries, some for x86, PPC, MIPS, some with up to 200 Mbytes file sizes for one single EXE! It's called a vulnerability research and reverse engineering paradise... or hell.\n\nAll the protocols now run on top of IP, which ends up having 12 layers thanks to encapsulation and still the weight of legacy in bugs quantity and diversity. We'll see how the porting of SS7 MAP on top of IP (SIGTRAN, Diameter) has given rise to funny Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against telecom core elements (DSR, STP), with trashy-crashy anti-forensics consequences for DPI and tracking (Hey @grugq!!).\n\nWe'll look into specific vulnerabilities, and talk about the very particular way that Network Equipment Vendors deal with security in the telecom domain. We will demo a virtualized Huawei HSS from our testbed and show some of the vulnerabilities and attacks directly on the equipment itself. We will finally talk about telco equipment and product security reviews and the fallacy of (some) certification and (many) standardization attempts. We will then see how to conduct a practical and fast telecom product security life cycle with automation and open source tools.\n\nABOUT PHILIPPE LANGLOIS\n\nPhilippe Langlois is an entrepreneur and leading security researcher, expert in the domain of telecom and network security. He has founded internationally recognized security companies (Qualys, WaveSecurity, INTRINsec, P1 Security) as well as led technical, development and research teams (Solsoft, TSTF). He founded Qualys and led the world-leading vulnerability assessment service. He founded a pioneering network security company Intrinsec in 1995 in France.\n\nHis first business, Worldnet, France's first public Internet service provider, was founded in 1993. Philippe was also lead designer for Payline, one of the first e-commerce payment gateways. He has written and translated security books, including some of the earliest references in the field of computer security, and has been giving speeches on network security since 1995 (Interop, BlackHat, HITB, Hack.lu). Previously a professor at Ecole de Guerre Economique and various universities in France (Amiens, Marne La Vall√©e) and internationally (FUSR-U, EERCI, ANRSI). He is a  FUSR-U collaborator and founding member.\n\nPhilippe advises industry associations (GSM Association Security Group, several national organizations) and governmental officials and contributes to Critical Infrastructure advisory committees  and conferences in Telecom and Network security. Now, Philippe is providing with P1 Security the first Core Network Telecom Signaling security scanner & auditor which help telecom companies, operators and government analyze where and how their critical telecom network infrastructure can be attacked.
