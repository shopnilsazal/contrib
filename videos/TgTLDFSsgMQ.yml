title: 'Erlang DC 2013 Erlang/OTP: Networked Sensors Savior by Gordon Miller'

description: "For years, integration of sensors into IP networks has been wandering in the desert of OO languages, tight coupling, and poor reliability. The promised land of service oriented architectures supporting any and all integration standards has been elusive and out of reach due to poor support of the modern, mainstream languages. Reaching forward from the past, Erlang, with its roots in high-reliability telecom (i.e. network) application development has arisen to deliver networked sensor application development into the promised land. This talk will discuss the specific challenges faced by today's sensor networks in use by the commercial sector and military can be easily and appropriately handled by Erlang.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGcb/"
