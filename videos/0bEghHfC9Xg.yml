recordingDate: 1297632764
description: "by Mike Hommey \r\n\r\nCold startup is the first experience a user has from an application, so you'd rather make it fast. Unfortunately, a lot of different things get in the way, from filesystems to toolchains, even including binary formats.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore various sides of the problem, and introduce some of the techniques implemented in Firefox 4.0 and in the works for subsequent major releases. This talk will cover some of the tools developed or used by Mozilla to improve Firefox cold startup, and some upcoming toolchain improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
