recordingDate: 1509660000
description: "Windows Server has introduced major advances in remote management hardening in recent years through\nPowerShell Just Enough Administration (\"JEA\"). When set up correctly, hardened JEA endpoints can provide\na formidable barrier for attackers: whitelisted commands, with no administrative access to the underlying\noperating system.\n\nIn this presentation, watch as we show how to systematically destroy these hardened endpoints by exploiting\ninsecure coding practices and administrative complexity."
