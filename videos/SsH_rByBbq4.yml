title: 'Exploring the possibilities of Unidirectional Data Flow Architectures on Android (en) - Brian Egan &'
recordingDate: 1448290427
description: "Droidcon Paris 2015\nUnidirectional data flow is a simple architecture used to design applications that are easy to reason about. It opens the doors to interesting possibilities. Namely, time travel debugging, improved testing, and the ability to deterministically reproduce bugs.\n\nWe’ll start with a tour of existing approaches and demo a current web implementation. Then, we’ll discuss the history. Afterwards, we’ll introduce a Java library for writing Android apps and present a demo with code examples. Finally, we’ll present a few more interesting avenues of exploration: Hot Reloading, better bug reporting, etc. \n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IFfO3BBsQSiVCBw3tSzA83QIp3X9hqCN0upoCWLSdMs/edit#slide=id.gcda2ce1aa_2_0\n\nDroidcon Paris 2015, more information here: http://droidcon.fr/schedule/"
