description: "by Nicolai HÃ¤hnle\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe `convergent` function attribute has been in LLVM for some time now tomodel restrictions e.g. on barrier intrinsics for GPUs. Recently, we've becomeaware of some additional restrictions that are required for the arguments ofcertain intrinsics in GPU code. The use of the `convergent` attribute onfunction parameters has been proposed for this purpose.\n\n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 15:00:00"
