description: "IMSI Catcher Counter-Surveillance\nFreddy Martinez\n\nThis talk will address how activists can detect IMSI Catchers around political protests and how to do some practical counter-surveillance. We will very briefly discuss the capabilities of IMSI catchers and then launch into a discussion about detection and evasion. In the talk we will describe practical (cheap / off the shelf) solutions that we have actually used in various scenarios. Lastly we will describe future work in this area.\n\nBIO: Freddy studied graduate level physics now works as a Linux SysAdmin. His current focus is on privacy/digital rights, free and open source projects, and FOIA work including multiple lawsuits against the City of Chicago."
