title: 'RailsConf 2015 - Rapid Data Modeling Using ActiveRecord and the JSON Data Type'
recordingDate: 1431531022
description: "by David Furber\n\nSo you are building an app that has a ton of forms each with tons of fields. Your heart sinks as you think of writing and managing all those models, migrations and associations. PostgreSQL JSON column and ActiveRecord::Store to the rescue! This talk covers a way to wrap these Rails 4 features to simplify the building of extensive hierarchical data models. You will learn to expressively declare schema-less attributes on your model that act much like â€œreal\" columns, meaning they are typecast, validated, query able, embeddable, and behave with Rails form builders."
