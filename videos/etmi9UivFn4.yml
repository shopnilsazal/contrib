description: "by Bjoern Michaelsen\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe LibreOffice build system provides integration with a set of IDEs includingKdevelop, Eclipse, Vim/YouCompleteMe, QtCreator and Visual Studio. This allowsdevelopers on all platforms to use their preferred environment and still IDEfeatures like code-completion on many of them without the need to manuallymaintain all of those. Gbuild, the LibreOffice build system, exports mostrelevant data about this to JSON files, which then can be used to createproject solutions on multiple IDEs. This talk describes how we got there, pastand future challenges and opportunities. It might also be of interest forother projects interested in providing something similar.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 12:50:00"
