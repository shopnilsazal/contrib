description: "JavaScript and Civil Rights: Using Your Skills For The Good of the People\n\nAccessibility is a civil right. We can take inspiration from Norway’s strict accessibility policy and make a business case for inclusion by building it into our projects using open source JS tools. I want to teach developers everywhere they are capable of making a big difference with code.\n\nMarcy Sutton\nMarcy Sutton works as a meta web developer on accessibility tools for other developers at Deque (DQ) Systems, a company focused on digital equality. Marcy is passionate about making the web accessible for everyone. \n\nShe loves applying her skills and personal values on the axe-core project, speaking at conferences around the world and producing accessibility screencasts for Egghead.io. \n\nHer blog, Accessibility Wins, highlights accessible user interfaces and tools, contributing a positive voice to the web development space. When away from the keyboard, Marcy can usually be found hiking, riding a bicycle or snowboarding."
