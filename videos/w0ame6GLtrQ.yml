description: "No Sudo for You! by: Rogelio J. Samour\n\nAs developers, we want to minimize the time we spend fighting with our development environment. The less time we spend dealing with configuration issues, the more time we can spend doing what we do best... creating awesome apps! I show how you can easily set up a development environment that is both flexible and powerful. But best of all, it wonâ€™t need regular attention!"
