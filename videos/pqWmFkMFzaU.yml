description: "DEF CON 16 - Ferdinand Schober: Gaming - the next overlooked security hole\n\"Thanks to Web 2.0 and other over hyped BS, development has been moving farther and farther away from bare metal. Assuming you trust your libraries, this could even be called a good thing. If you're high.\"\n\nPC gaming, despite Microsoft's best efforts, is not dead. Yet. The modding community is alive and active, and even those same over hyped web technologies are starting to encroach in to shaders, and other things they shouldn't touch. Let's not even get started on the shady communities providing bots, cheats, and other grey market goods.\n\nWe're now seeing those unifying technologies the web, and monolithic engines making their way in to these games. Automatic updates, electronic publishing systems, in-game advertisements, pay-for-item MMORPG systems all of these represent structural weaknesses that more and more people should be exploiting. Given the expectation of today's gamers a far as graphics, physics, and other frivolous crap, smaller developers have to purchase someone else's engine to get started and all of the bugs that come with it.\n\nThis presentation will begin with a quick overview of what we've seen so far, and will progress in to specific weak points in current and future releases.\n\nHigh points will include:\n\nWhy buying someone else's engine is a bad idea (with charts!)\nThe proliferation of middleware, and the homogenization of gaming\nThe little \"nude patch\" that could: how to own yourself\nFake world + real money + ??? = Profit, or the economics of game exploits\n\nFerdinand Schober has been ranting about games for several years, and has been playing them in lieu of sleep since grade school. He recently left a security testing position with the highest ranked game publisher. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
