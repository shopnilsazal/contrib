title: 'DEF CON 19 - Panel - Meet The Federal Agent 2.0'
recordingDate: 1383377354
description: "Meet the Federal Agent 2.0: Current Federal Agents that are running operations and investigations now, targeting today's threats to our nation. Meet the Fed at DEFCON 19 will offer the attendee a chance to ask questions about how these Federal Agents got where they are, general investigative issues relative to their current duties and other relevant topics. MTFA 2.0 differs from past panels as it brings a younger, current operations flavor and has less of a leadership/old school feel. The panel will also be smaller than past years since the focus will be specific to credentialed Federal Agents.\n\nNote: Agents will not discuss current investigations nor will they entertain inappropriate questions."
