description: "Yes, and... by Adam Cuppy & Julia Cuppy\n\nWhat happens when we drop \"No, but...\" from our daily interactions or life choices in favor of the #1 rule of improv: Yes, and..?\n\nThis talk is not a technical deep dive into the Ruby VM or a walk through of a new gem.

This talk is for introverts and extroverts alike. You won't be brought onstage (unless you want to be)."
