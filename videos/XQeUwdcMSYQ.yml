description: "As Software Engineers it is our job to surprise and delight our users; providing engaging user experiences that does not detract from the key functionality of our products.\n\nThe focus users unwittingly place upon UX is often at odds with the way that we as developers think about the functional elements of our apps; something which seems logical to us as coders is often bizarre, weird or simply not understood by those that we are building our products for.\n\nIn addition UX designers often come up with better ways of doing things; making these changes in our products can confuse users mental models of how things work which can lead to less intuitive products.\n\nThis talk will explore how developers can make functional products more usable and will explore why guerrillas should be a part of every development life cycle."
