description: "By Jim  Jones\n\nBuilding a web app consists of stressful choices. Should the signup button be red or blue? Does my site's sales pitch sound awkward? What will the user think about my site the first five seconds they visit?\nUsing Rails and Amazon's Mechanical Turk service, I will show you how you can perform usability tests, A/B testing and gain valuable feedback on your site BEFORE launching your app to a single real user.\nI'll walk you through :\n1) Sample code for quickly integrating your Rails site with Mechanical Turk\n2) How to structure your HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks) so that you solicit detailed feedback from the workers.\n3) Integrating A/B testing so that you can quickly decide which design component is better\n4) Tactics for stopping automated bots from ruining your usability tests\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG9X/"
