With many AR and VR platforms now available, we're witnessing the birth of a new medium.\n\nIn many ways, this boom is similar to the personal computer revolution of the 70s and 80s. People are wondering: \"Besides games, what are these gadgets good for, anyway?\"\n\nIn this session, we'll see how people are using mixed reality for social good. Then, we'll learn about the Tango and Daydream platforms from Google. We'll use these and other platforms to build our own mixed reality experience."
