description: 'Maximize your wardriving experience using wigle.net, the Wireless Geographic Logging Engine! We will hit all the hot WIGLE topics, such as sensor selection and placement, the best Android phones to use for your WIGLEs and where to mount them, compatible Android apps, Raspberry Pi sensors and Kismet, multiple-antenna setups, drones (both electro-mechanical and biological), full-neighborhood coverage (no house left behind) and covert WIGLEing. We''ll talk about the whys of multiple-sensor wardriving in terms of channels and scan intervals and show the benefits of using more than one device to wardrive. We''ll also show some... uh... god-awfully-huge-multiple-antenna setups that, while not practical in certain circumstances, can really dial up your results if you have a few shipping containers to carry them around in. Also we''ll be talking about identifying what you are seeing, whether it''s home WiFi installations, MAC analysis for multiple-access-point devices, mobile access points, remote stations, cell modems or phones and other... let''s say... interesting stuff, along with correlation and analysis of data from your WIGLEs with WiFi clients, Bluetooth devices, geo-location, and photographic information. We''ll demonstrate the use of the WIGLE API and incorporating WIGLE data into other areas, such as digital forensics and good, old-fashioned WiFi hacking. The purpose of this is to get you out WIGLEing without looking like a complete loon, (emphasis on complete). Whether you''re in it to find free access points, contribute to this open geo-location source, or just be on the top of the leader boards, this is the WIGLE presentation for you. Representatives of wigle.net have offered to be on hand with stickers and precious, precious data and information! If you''re going to WIGLE, WIGLE like your life depends on it.'
