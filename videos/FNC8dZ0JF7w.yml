description: 'Sharing and Growing the World’s Knowledge with Machine Learning: At Quora our mission is to “share and grow the world’s knowledge”. To accomplish this, we need to build a complex ecosystem which requires us to understand and solve a variety of problems like content quality, demand, user engagement, personalization, and author reputation. In this talk, we will go over several exciting challenges of applying machine learning to these problems. We will give examples such as our ranking and recommendation approaches, as well as systems and tools we built to support experimentation and integration of machine learning models in the product.'
