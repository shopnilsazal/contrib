description: "by Alexandre Viau\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nRing is free software for communication developed by Savoir-faire Linux in ourMontr√©al offices. It was conceived and developed on a peer-to-peerarchitecture model, relying on OpenDHT, its dedicated distributed hash tablefor retrieving its users on the network. Ring's Beta 2 version released onnovember 4th 2016 provides many new features for its users. The mostinteresting of them is the identity and account management mechanism,implementted on a blockchain Ethereum technology.\n\nSince the project started and the software's first release about 2 years ago,Ring has evolved in many directions. Our new Beta 2 release features newfuncionalities developed to improve the user's experience: The Multi-devicefunction makes it possible for users to associate many devices to the sameidentity (many RingID's to the same identity/person), and all the devices willbe synchronized. The Blockchain supports the multi-device feature for theidentity and account management. It is implemented on an Ethereum technology.OpenDHT library was enhanced in order to optimize user's retrieval on the p2pnetwork and decrease the network's operations time. Ring is now available onUWP (Universal Serial Platform thus offering support for Ring's clients ondifferent platforms supported and maintained from Microsoft.\n\nFinally, we are planning to release Ring's first stable version in a fewmonths, which will introduce new elements and potentially a higer level ofsoftware reliability, users' privacy protection, utilisability and a betteruser experience\n\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 13:40:00"
