recordingDate: 1353056151
description: "Is security a priority for your team? The recent compromises of LinkedIn, eharmony, Last.fm, and Sony (twenty times) show that it's not enough to make it \"a priority\": it needs to be priority zero.\n\nLearn how to build a security process that will help you detect and mitigate vulnerabilities at all levels and across all system boundaries.\n\nLearn how to (more) accurately assess risk and make smart decisions about when and how to address security vulnerabilities.\n\nLearn how to respond effectively to contain and minimize damage when you are compromised, and how to recover service as quickly as possible.\n\nLearn how to disclose an incident to the public in an open, honest, responsible way that gives your users the information they need to protect themselves and opens the door to rebuilding lost trust and goodwill.\n\nLearn how not to do the above from the tragicomic examples of others.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGfN/"
