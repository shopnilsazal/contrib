title: 'AppSec EU 2017 I Am Not A Robot: Job Security In A DevSecOps World by Correy Voo'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495760056
description: "The automation of tech and non-tech jobs to be done is hitting the news on a daily basis. IT and application security is no exception in which there are concerns over job security around automation. While there exists a dearth of skilled professionals in the SecDevOps space, the countervailing force of fear over job security can be an organizational hurdle to organizational change.\n\nThis talk will explore transitioning individuals understanding of their own \"security value\" from being a point of control and decision making, to a business value creator regarding security and compliance. This talk would be geared toward engineering professionals who would like ways of elevating the conversation from security technical controls to security business value.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
