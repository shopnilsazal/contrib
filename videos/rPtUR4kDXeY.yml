description: "RailsConf 2017: Understanding ‘Spoon Theory’ and Preventing Burnout by Jameson Hampton\n\nSpoon theory is a metaphor about the finite energy we each have to do things in a day. While a healthy, advantaged person may not have to worry about running out of ‘spoons,’ people with chronic illnesses or disabilities and members of marginalized communities often have to consider how they must ration their energy in order to get through the day. Understanding how 'spoons' can affect the lives of your developers and teammates can help companies lessen the everyday burdens on their underrepresented employees, leaving them more spoons to do their best work, avoid burnout and lead fulfilling lives."
