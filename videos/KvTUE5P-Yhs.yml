title: '#HITB2013AMS D2T1 Sebastien Kaczmarek - Dreamboot - A UEFI Bootkit'

description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2013ams/materials/ \n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\n\nUnified Extensible Firmware Interface or UEFI, is the result of a common effort from several manufacturers and industry stakeholders based on an initiative from Intel. It is a new software component or 'middleware' interposed between the hardware and the operating system designed to replace the traditional aka old BIOS.\n\nThis presentation is a study of the overall architecture of UEFI from a security point of view with a focus on a bootkit implementation for Windows 8 x64 which exploits the UEFI firmware: Dreamboot. Dreamboot has two specific payloads: Privilege escalation and Windows local authentication bypass. DreamBoot comes in the form of a bootable ISO, to use preferably as part of a physical attack (i.e. when the attacker has physical access to the machine peripherals: DVD or USB ports). It is also fully functional in virtualized environments like VMWare Workstation or ESX.\n\nThe presentation also describes how to develop for UEFI platforms using Tianocore SDK and the new security risks its deployment implies. The Windows boot process and its evolution from BIOS to UEFI implementation will be covered and all bootkit implementation details explained.\n\nABOUT SEBASTIEN KACZMAREK\n\nSebastien Kaczmarek is a senior security researcher at QuarksLAB skilled in reverse engineering and cryptanalysis. He specializes in software security, malware and low level code analysis on Microsoft platforms and enjoys studying all execution layers from hardware to software while also analyzing web vulnerabilities.\n\nHe has studied computer science for 5 years in USTL (Lille University -- France) before specializing in information security and reverse engineering. He has published a paper in French journal MISC, titled \"RDP & Cryptography, RSA, Anecdotes and Implementation Errors\". He is currently working on DRM, UEFI implementations and new opportunities to develop bootkits for Microsoft's Windows 8 platform."
