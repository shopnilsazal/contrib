description: "Bringing Kubernetes into Salesforce [B] - Steve Sandke, Salesforce\n\nI'll be talking about our journey to using Kubernetes at Salesforce, in the World's Largest Enterprise Cloud Infrastructure. Topics will include:\n\n-- Our motivations for choosing Kubernetes, and how we built confidence in the technology, solution and approach.\n-- Our choice to build a lightweight abstraction atop Kubernetes artifacts, and lessons we've learned based on that. This includes our use of a fully declarative vs, API-driven deployment mechanism, which comes with pros and cons.\n-- Lessons learned from bringing up Kubernetes in bare metal environments.\n-- Securing communications between Kubernetes- and non-Kubernetes hosted workloads.\n-- General observations around how shifting to the Kubernetes world requires changes to host-centric tooling.\n\nAbout Steve Sandke\nSteve is a Principal Architect at Salesforce, based in San Francisco, CA. Heâ€™s spent the last few years building out infrastructure aimed at easing service deployment at Salesforce. Prior to that, he held various positions at Proofpoint, Microsoft, Loudcloud, WebTV, and others."
