With the rapidly increasing amount of students coming out of bootcamp schools we have now created a gap within our communities of the \"haves\", and the \"Looking for job\"s. Being the organizer of New York City's 4,500+ member Ruby community with NYC.rb I have discovered ways we can ensure the generations of rubyists after us have a path paved before them. \"Cyclical Mentorship\" is the answer. Best part is we will know individually how we can immediately begin the feedback loop of not computers, but people!"
