title: 'Hack the Cloud Hack the Company: the Cloud Impact on Enterprise Security'
recordingDate: 1455368537
description: "iSEC Partners routinely carry out Attacker Modeled Penetration Tests that use any and all means possible to gain entry to a company. The goal is to test organizations against true-to-life attack and penetration activities that real attackers use in the breaches that make headline News (and the breaches that don't). \n\nOrganizations that use Cloud Services to provision an operating environment to support a product, or use Cloud Service Providers to outsource elements of traditional enterprise IT into the Cloud, can find those very aspects used against them in an attack. While the potential attack surface for a breach changes, in many ways the use of Cloud infrastructure can make it easier for an attacker to gain access to critical systems and data. In this session the speaker will describe methods of penetration used during recent tests, illustrating how Cloud Services are viable entry points that lead to significant compromises.\n\nKevin Dunn\nTechnical VP, NCC Group\nKevin Dunn is Technical Vice President for NCC Group in Austin, TX.
