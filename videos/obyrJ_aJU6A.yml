description: "How to Performance by Eileen Uchitelle\n\nUnderstanding performance output can feel like reading tea leaves. It makes sense to a few people, but many of us are left in the dark; overwhelmed and frustrated by the data. Additionally there are a ton of performance tools to choose from; StackProf, RubyProf, AllocationTracer. Where do you even start?\n\nIn this talk we will not only look at how to read performance output, but when and how to use the right profilers for the job. We'll discuss a variety of methods and techniques for benchmarking and profiling so you can get the most out of each performance tool.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H0pg/"
