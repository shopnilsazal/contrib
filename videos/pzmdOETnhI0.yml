description: "PyData London 2018\n\nBird sounds are complex and fascinating. Can we automatically \"understand\" them using machine learning? I will describe my academic research into \"machine listening\" for bird sounds. I'll tell you why it's important, methods we use, Python libraries, open code and open data that you can use. Examples of the latest research, and a successful commercial recognition app (Warblr).\n\nSlides:  https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/whos-singing-automatic-bird-sound-recognition-with-machine-learning-dan-stowell\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
