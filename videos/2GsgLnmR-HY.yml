description: "Erik Kastner and John Goulah, Etsy, Inc.\n\nDevelopers deploy production code more than 30 times per day at Etsy. Small, rapid changes allow us to move fast, detect failure, and respond quickly. This works for a number of cultural and technical reasons. Learn about the tool we built, Deployinator, to automate this process and how we accomplish this effectively. We hope open-sourcing the tool will give people an opportunity to make their deployment process more agile and efficient."
