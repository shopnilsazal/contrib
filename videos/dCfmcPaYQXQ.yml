description: 'Someone once told me that software development is a constant battle against complexity. Over the past three years we''ve built several large systems at GitHub and if anything, that saying is an understatement. Things like tight coupling, insufficient testing or documentation, lack of versioning discipline, and underspecified design documents can easily lead you down a path of ruin. In this talk I''ll cover many of the techniques we use at GitHub to defend against complexity in our Ruby systems, including Readme Driven Development, Semantic Versioning, TomDoc, Git/GitHub workflow, modularization, metrics, and exception reporting.'
