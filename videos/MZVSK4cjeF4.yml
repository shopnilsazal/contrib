description: "Ruby Preserves by Craig Buchek\n\nHow simple can we make an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that's still useful? What if we just used SQL, instead of trying to hide it from developers?\n\nI decided to find out.\n\nIn this presentation, we'll explore a simple ORM that uses the Repository and Data Mapper patterns. We'll also see how using these patterns enables us to write simpler model code.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H09j/"
