description: "Greg Conti - Interface Design of Hacking Tools\nInterface Design of Hacking Tools\n\nPublicly available computer security tools are often great works of\ntechnological expertise. A great deal of effort goes into the technical implementation, often at the expense of the user interface and overall user experience. Designed for all levels of expertise, this talk explores common user interface design techniques that will put a usable front end on computer security tools. A variety of tools will be examined and critiqued to illustrate and reinforce these techniques. Attendees will leave with an increased understanding of user interface and user experience design that they can apply to their own development projects to make them more effective.\n\nGreg Conti is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the United States Military Academy. He holds a Masters Degree in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the United States Military Academy. His areas of expertise include network security, interface design and information warfare. Greg has worked at a variety of military intelligence assignments specializing in Signals Intelligence. Currently he is on a Department of Defense Fellowship and is working on his PhD in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. He is conducting research into Denial of Information Attacks."
