description: "Selena Deckelmann, PostgreSQL\nFrom LISA '12, the 26th Large Installation System Administration Conference\n\nIt's no secret that the field of system administration has struggled for respect among computer scientists. When I broke the news that I was taking a job as a system administrator directly out of college, a fellow graduate asked sarcastically, \"Why would you want to be a janitor?\"\n\nSystem administration principles are typically not taught at universities, where \"education\" (concepts and frameworks) is valued over \"training\" (explicit instruction of tasks). It's true that system administration courses and a couple degree programs existâ€”but they are the exception rather than the rule. The state of related curriculum in K--12 education is even more dire.\n\nThe belief that education and training are separate is harmful. It's helped make computer science educators hostile to efforts to adopt system administration curriculum and a CS degree largely irrelevant when hiring Web developers."
