description: 'What is cognitive memory? How can you “implant” a password into it? Is this truly secure? Curiosity around these questions prompted exploration of the research and concepts surrounding the idea of making the authentication process more secure by implanting passwords into an individual’s memory. The result? The idea is that you are not able to reveal your credentials under duress but you are still able to authenticate to a system. This talk will cover the stages of memory pertaining to encoding, storage and retrieval; the limitations of human memory; and the concept of serial interception sequence learning training. Current research and experimentation will be reviewed as well as the potential for forensic hypnosis to be used to “hack” this approach.'
