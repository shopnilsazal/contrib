description: "Lenard Kleinrock & Sally Richards - At Risk! Privacy: Homeland's Rights To Take It Away And The Hacker As A Hero To Restore Privacy Via Code To Protect The Every Day User\nAt Risk! Privacy: Homeland's Rights To Take It Away And The Hacker As A Hero To Restore Privacy Via Code To Protect The Every Day User\n\nLeonard Kleinrock , co-creator of the Internet and Sally , author and privacy advocate, talk about the past present and future of privacy and civil rights and how they pertain to the next wave of technology -- keeping your data safe from both government agencies and commercial entities leveraging your info for Big Brother and commercial uses? Will this next level of technology to block Big Brother be illegal and the technologists developing it be jailed for some government infringement of national security? Where will the code heroes of tomorrow come from? And how will they be able to leverage their code into commerce?\n\nLenard Kleinrock, Co-founder of the Internet\nDr. Leonard Kleinrock is a world-renowned figure in computer networking. He is the founder of Technology Transfer Institute (TTI), Linkabit Corporation, and Nomadix, Inc. Dr. Kleinrock is considered one of the fathers of the Internet, having been the first to develop the underlying principles of packet switching. A professor of Computer Science at UCLA, Len has always worked at the frontier of new technology; his current interests include nomadic computing, self-organizing networks and gigabit networks. He is the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including the L.M. Ericsson Prize, the Marconi International Fellowship Award, and the National Academy of Engineering's Draper Prize. Len has written six books and over 225 professional papers, and is an internationally recognized speaker for business and technical audiences on the future of computing, communications and the Internet.\n\nSally Richards,Author, Privacy Advocate\nSally Richards is an international Journalist and author who speaks out about technologists' civil rights to create technology and the users' rights to use technology -- as well as the privacy issues that have arisen out of 9/11 and Homeland insecurity. Her last book, FutureNet (John Wiley & Sons, 2002) addresses the past, present and future of the Internet as told by its creators and visionaries and features Len Kleinrock, John Perry Barlow, Dimitry Sklyarov, Phil Zimmermann and others fighting the good fight. The increased traffic on Sally's site www.http://sallyrichards.com by .gov, .mil and strange IP addresses from other government agencies throughout the world caused Sally to dig even deeper to increase her work against government agencies working toward removing civil rights and forcing technology guidelines. Sally is currently in Vegas working on her latest book describing what is going on so people can do something about it instead of having to defend to their grandchildren why they let civil rights we already had slip through our fingers. She is also the Managing Editor of the Las Vegas Business Press."
