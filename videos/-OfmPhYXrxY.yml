description: "In this GDC 2014 session, Swyrve's Steven Collins explains why the Bayesian approach to A/B testing and game design, in comparison to the more traditional null hypothesis testing method, permits more dynamic analysis of the information as it arrives (i.e. differences in \"behavior\" of users subjected to the different variants in the test) and allows for real-time A/B testing and optimization of games. \n\nRegister for GDC: http://ubm.io/2gk5KTU\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
