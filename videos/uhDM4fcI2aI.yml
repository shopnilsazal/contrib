description: "\"NewSQL vs. NoSQL for New OLTP\", by Michael Stonebraker, MIT\n\n** Disclaimer  The views and opinions expressed in this video are those of the speaker(s) and do not  necessarily reflect the views of the USENIX Association. **\n\nEnterprises once used RDBMs for online transaction processing (OLTP) applications, which we affectionately call OldSQL. New OLTP applications have greater performance requirements; in many modern applications—multiplayer games, gambling, social networks, etc.—OldSQL is cracking under the volume of interactions. I contrast two alternatives to OldSQL: NoSQL, where SQL and ACID are jettisoned for better performance; and NewSQL, where SQL and ACID are retained, and innovative architectures improve performance."
