description: "As developers, we like to think in stories and epics. My favourite story runs like this:\n\nAs a technologist I want to use my skills and expertise to improve human welfare.\n\nEnter Bahmni and OpenMRS, two humanitarian open source software systems. Both systems are used mainly in the global south to run hospitals and to improve the standard of medical care.\n\nLearn what these systems are about, how they are changing the lives of people in many countries and have a closer look at their architecture and the underlying technology. Last but not least, the session concludes with some tips and tricks for a successful start in the humanitarian open source software space. Learn how to start small by solving tickets on your own or how to start big by hosting an all day code jam.\n\nAfter all, life is more than coding shopping baskets."
