description: "Mageia, successes and lessons learned 6 years after forking Retrospective and future plans from the community-driven distribution\nby Anne Nicolas and Samuel Verschelde\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nSix years after having forked the commercial Mandriva Linux distribution andwith five solid releases, the Mageia community wants to share its successesand lessons learned from developing, releasing and supporting a user-friendlyand flexible distribution with an inclusive governance model. Mageia's aim isto bridge the gap between end users and developers, encouraging andfacilitating contributions from all users thanks to low entry barriers andmentoring programs in its various teams.\n\n* * *\n\nThe 100% community-driven GNU/Linux distribution Mageia was forked from thethen-unsteady (and now defunct) commercial distribution Mandriva Linux 6 yearsago, in September 2010. Since then, the volunteers from the Mageia communityhave published 5 stable releases, with the 6th one in the making, alwaysfocusing on bridging the gap between end users and contributors, to create auser-friendly but powerful system made for and by its users.\n\nForking a commercial distribution with paid staff to run it as a community-driven non-profit endeavour relying solely on volunteers was an ambitious move– with the perspective of those 6 years of development, the Mageia communitywould like to present the lessons learned, the hardships and successes it hador still has and its plans to continue progressing forward as a community-based independent GNU/Linux distribution.\n\nThe talk will aim at outlining general conclusions that could be relevantbeyond the scope of GNU/Linux distributions, and therefore provide usefulinsights for other projects transitioning from a company-driven development topartial or full community focus.\n\n_Speakers:_\n\n**Anne Nicolas** is one of the founders of Mageia, and since then active aspackagers team leader, member of the Mageia Council and chairwoman ofMageia.org's Board (non-profit association representing the community'sinterests). She is responsible for building ISO images for stable anddevelopment releases. She is also of former employee of Mandriva SA and knewwell the development and governance of Mandriva Linux.\n\n**Samuel Verschelde** was a long time end user and occasional contributor ofMandriva Linux when the fork was initiated in 2010. He then decided to jointhe adventure and to get more involved in the development of his system ofchoice. He is most active in the bug triage and quality assurance teams, whichhe helped organise and led several times. He is also a member of the MageiaCouncil and the Mageia.org Board.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 11:00:00"
