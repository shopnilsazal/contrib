description: "My favorite NP-complete problem! By Mark Dominus\n\nNP-complete problems are the hardest problems whose solutions can be efficiently checked for correctness. An efficient method of solving any NP-complete problem would translate directly into efficient solutions for all of them.\n\nMany famous and interesting problems are NP-complete, but this is not one of them! This is the problem of how to distribute “Elmo’s World” segments onto a series of video releases.\n\nNobody knows a good way to solve NP-complete problems. The Elmo’s World people were not able to solve their problem either.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/KLIN/"
