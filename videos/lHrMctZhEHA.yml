description: "Leapfrog:ing online payments utilizing eventual consistency and functional programming.  When battling technical debt, a fast growing business in a rapidly changing market, mainstream technologies are not always the way to go. Klarna was founded in 2006 and has migrated from a pay me later service to become a bank. It services millions of customers who get their good before paying, and is handling the payments of over 15,000 e-commerce sites. In his talk, David will share his view of alternative technologies when developing mission critical systems. \n\n\n\n\n\nLiked the song? It's \"Tank\" by Seatbelts"
