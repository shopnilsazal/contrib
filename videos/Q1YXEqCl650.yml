description: 'Uber senior software engineer Kris Kowal discusses "the design pattern that shall not be named." In other words, a lesser used but sublime and surprisingly durable design pattern, that strangely has no name. It does not appear in the Gamma et al Gang of Four book bearing the title "Design Patterns", though you might see it there in many guises. One might call it “functions that accept callbacks that oddly return things” or simply “burritos, but in space”.'
