title: 'Kevin Wilson - Evaluating Skills in Education and Other Settings An Overview'
recordingDate: 1418145155
description: "PyData NYC 2014\nOne of the big problems in educational assessment is *norming*, whose simplest form amounts to giving more credit for answering more difficult questions. But the ideas that come from norming have wide-ranging applications: Comparing examinees who have seen different sets of questions, effectively defining \"performance at grade level\", measuring how students learn (relative to their cohort, their school, or any other bucketing scheme). Moreover, similar techniques have been used to rank the skills of players in online video games and assessing the competency of Mechanical Turkers among other applications. In this talk, we'll cover some of the common settings and objective functions whose maxima might be interpreted to solve these problems. And, like any good modeler should do, we'll spend most of the time on where their assumptions break down, difficulties in computing and interpreting the solutions to these programs, and where they differ. Much Python will be discussed, and many pretty pictures will be drawn."
