description: "All Together Now! Programming the Quantum Computer By Jennifer Fernick\n\nIn this talk, we unravel the sublime beauty of programming in an abstract and philosophical way, not by moving away from the laws of physics, but by moving toward them. In particular, I will introduce recent work on programming languages designed for quantum computers, and explain how they are related to some of the biggest questions in computer science, information theory, and quantum mechanics.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/KLIP/"
