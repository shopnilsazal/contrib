description: "By, Michael May\nMost of us have some form of cache anxiety. We’re good at caching static content like images and scripts, but taking the next step - caching dynamic and user-specific content - is confusing and often requires a leap of faith. In this talk you’ll learn new and old strategies for caching dynamic content, HTTP performance rules to live by, and a better understanding of how to accelerate any application. This is just what the doctor ordered: a prescription for cache money."
