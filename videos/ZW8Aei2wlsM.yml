description: "View slides for this presentation here:\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/PyData/vincent-warmerdam\n\nPyData Berlin 2014 \nVincent D. Warmerdam is a data scientist and developer at GoDataDriven and a former university lecturer of mathematics and statistics. He is fluent in python, R and javascript and is currently checking out with scala and julia. Currently he does a lot of research on machine learning algorithms and applications that can solve problems in real time. The intersection of the algorithm and the use-case is of the most interest to him. During a half year sabbatical he travelled as a true digital nomad from Buenos Aires to San Fransisco while still programming for clients. He has two nationalities (US/Netherlands) and lives in Amsterdam."
