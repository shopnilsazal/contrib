description: "One of the best ways to learn is to experiment with seemingly crazy ideas. When Rails 3 first came out, it became easier than ever to embed a Sinatra application inside your Rails application. But what if you wanted to implement parts of Sinatra in Rails?\nHave you ever wished your controllers had Sinatra style routes? Have you ever wondered if you could render a template in the same context as your controllers? What about one single-file Rails applications?\nIn this talk, we are going to build all those functionalities into a Rails application, making sure we learn about Rails internals and have fun while doing it.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGaq/"
