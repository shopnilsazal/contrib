description: "contenteditable: Roll for sanity by Garann Means was a roller coaster ride into the insane inner workings of a single feature in the browser in this talk from Web Rebels 2013.\nYou may have heard that the contenteditable attribute is part of HTML5. Great news! We can edit almost anything, almost anywhere, without needing to swap in a messy-looking textarea.\nHowever, the history of contenteditable is longer and darker than its most recent implementations. The contenteditable attribute opens the door to a world that has driven developers to madness. We'll talk about the horror - and the power - that lives in the shadows of the browser. We'll go beyond merely replacing text and edit HTML on the fly, work with selected text, and even try to position the cursor.\nIf our sanity survives, we'll master contenteditable elements."
