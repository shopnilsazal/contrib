description: 'In this talk, we will scan the local area for bluetooth packets with the help of the Ubertooth one, intercept them, and extrapolate as much information as possible, such as tracing mac addresses to find the device type, or brute-forcing encrypted packets to unveil the information you thought to be, “secure.” We will also scan the local area for vulnerable wireless networks using weak encryption methods.
