description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nKubernetes Runs Anywhere, but Does your Data? - Jared Watts, Upbound (Beginner Skill Level)\n\nKubernetes is now the defacto container orchestrator and it is able to run basically anywhere, from cloud providers to bare metal clusters. With this ubiquitous ability to run your applications comes a need for persistent storage that also runs anywhere Kubernetes runs. One of the most powerful features of Kubernetes is the ability to deploy your applications consistently no matter what the environment is. The same should be true for your storage if you want to realize the full potential of Kubernetes. We will walk through the architecture of Rook (https://rook.io/), a distributed storage orchestrator for Kubernetes that provides storage to your application pods anywhere Kubernetes runs. We&rsquo;ll explore how to use extension mechanisms such as CRDs as well as patterns like controllers/operators, resource management, and rolling upgrades to build a portable Kubernetes storage solution.\n\nAbout Jared\nJared Watts is a Founding Engineer at Upbound, where he is working on advancing cloud-native computing by \"\"freeing the cloud\"\" and is also a maintainer for the open source Rook project (https://rook.io/). Before Upbound, he worked on innovative storage projects at Quantum Corp. and helped found Rook. Prior to Quantum, Jared worked on P2P storage distributed across the public internet at Symform, a startup later acquired by Quantum. Before that, Jared began his career at Microsoft working on applications for Windows Server setup and management."
