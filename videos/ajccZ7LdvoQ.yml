title: 'DEF CON 25 - Christopher Domas - Breaking the x86 Instruction Set'
language: English
recordingDate: 1509660001
description: 'A processor is not a trusted black box for running code; on the contrary, modern x86 chips are packed full of secret instructions and hardware bugs. In this talk, we''ll demonstrate how page fault analysis and some creative processor fuzzing can be used to exhaustively search the x86 instruction set and uncover the secrets buried in your chipset. We''ll disclose new x86 hardware glitches, previously unknown machine instructions, ubiquitous software bugs, and flaws in enterprise hypervisors. Best of all, we''ll release our sandsifter toolset, so that you can audit - and break - your own processor.'
