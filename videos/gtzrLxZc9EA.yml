recordingDate: 1530027264
description: "Further information: https://foss-backstage.de/session/how-manage-nearly-one-million-slocs-project\n\nWorking on an open source project is certainly not easy, especially when it starts to be big. Past the excitement of the beginning, how do we make it going on in the long run ?\n\nWhat about a project that grows bigger and bigger, up to a point we are facing hundred of thousands of single lines of code ? What about testing it across multiple platforms ? What about the toolings that are needed – debugging, data migration, etc – ? What about the documentation ?\n\nThis talk is about the few simple rules that make it easier, and successful. It also exposes a few traps that are not so easy to avoid, and how to keep people involved in the long run.\n\nMore critical, it will explain how to conduct the project so that it’s still relevant after 10 years, in a moving industry."
