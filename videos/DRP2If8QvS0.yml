title: '#HITB2017AMS COMMSEC D2 - Uberbounty: Bug Bounty From A Program''s Perspective - Rob Fletcher'
recordingDate: 1493973782
description: "This talk will give researchers insight into a program’s perspective on bug bounty. First, we identify characteristics of a successful bug bounty researcher. Then we’ll dive into some specific example reports with the goal of understanding why some reports are more valuable than others – researchers should expect to understand which types of reports are highest ROI for their time and effort.\n\nFinally, we will give researchers insight into the why/how around our recent program updates.\n\nCharacteristics of a successful bb researcher\n\n* Report quality: reproducibility, succinct write-up w/ HTTP requests/responses, document current understanding of security impact\n* Communication: kindness, patience, empathy\n* Security impact: how would you exploit this? is this monetary impact to Uber or exposure of user data? are there mitigating factors that reduce severity?\n\nWhich reports are most valuable and why\n\n* Less valuable bugs: promo code fraud; taking a free ride/sandwich; open redirects\n* Most valuable bugs: account take Over (oauth redirects, password resets); authorization issues relating to user data; RCE (because potential user data exposure)\n\nProgram updates\n\n* Increasing our minimum bounty\n* Change in when we issue bounties\n\n===\n\nApplication security keeps me curious and I’m lucky I get to do something I love with awesome people. There are surprising similarities between finding a security vulnerability and understanding how people need/want to be managed – I find that interesting and gratifying.\n\nMy workplace happiness scale, increasing from left to right:\nfind bug - fix bug - find systemic issue - fix systemic issue - manage awesome people - find the right gif\n\nFinding a bug is good, but finding bugs is better.\nFixing a bug is great, but fixing a class of bug is greater.\nEducating developers to not write bugs is security nirvana.\n\nMy current role involves a mix of all the above and I enjoy the ability to be a manager while also contributing to technical initiatives."
