description: "Autoscaling in Kubernetes [I] - Marcin Wielgus, Google\n\nOne of the nicest features of Kubernetes is its ability to automatically adjust the cluster size and the number of pod replicas to the current traffic and load. During this talk I will explain what is the current state of pod and node autoscaling in Kubernetes, how it exactly works, what metrics can be used to drive autoscaling, and what are the best practices to apply it in production.\n\nAbout Marcin Wielgus\nMarcin has been with Google since 2010, working on various projects ranging from Android applications to recommendation engines. Currently he is the part of the Kubernetes team and he is mainly focused on autoscaling and cluster federation."
