description: "Adaptive Testing Methodology: Crowdsourced Testing Methodology Customized to the Target Stack\n\nTesting methodology is a sore subject for most pentesters. Everyone has their own way to do things, and 3 people testing the same thing often end up with different resultsâ€”especially when constrained for time.\n\nThe ASTM project has two goals: 1) allow testers to consistently find the best vulnerabilities in the shortest amount of time, and 2) provide a framework for community improvement of the methodologies.\n\nASTM combines a time restraint with a quick technology detection step to build a customized testing methodology for that specific website given how much time you have to test it.\n\nIOActive\nDirector of Client Advisory Services\nDaniel Miessler is a Director of Client Advisory Services with IOActive, based out of San Francisco, California. Daniel has 15 years of experience in information security with a focus on web, mobile, and\_IoT, and is a project leader for the OWASP\_IoT\_and OWASP Mobile Top Ten projects. In his spare time, he enjoys reading, writing, programming, and table tennis.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
