description: "Presented by Marc-Andre Lemburg\n\nInstalling Python packages is usually done with one of the available package installation systems, e.g. pip, easy_install, zc.buildout, manual \"python setup.py install\".\n\nThese systems work fine as long as you have Python-only packages. For packages that contain binaries, such as Python C extensions or other platform dependent code, the situation is a lot less bright.\n\nIn the talk I will present a new web installer system that we're currently developing to overcome these limitations. The system uses the dynamic Python installation interface that all installers support (\"python setup.py install\") with a web installer which automatically selects, downloads, verifies and installs the binary package for your platform."
