language: English
recordingDate: 1525809995
description: "Sumukh Shivaprakash is a senior developer on the Service Fabric team. He works on multiple projects related to reliability and data replication. His is the low-level world of replicated state machines and distributed data reliability.\n\nOne of these areas is the replicator that works in concert with the Reliable State Manager (deep dive coming soon) and the TStore that you learned a lot about with Preetha in our last conversation introducing Reliable Collections ( https://youtu.be/wcfewGJ6Tu8 ). Specifically, Sumukh digs into the logging replicator and friends. This is a natural continuation from Preetha's excellent whiteboarding adventure.\n\nGet some popcorn, put on your thinking cap, and enjoy. Meet Sumukh, another super talented developer on the Service Fabric team.\n\nTweet to @Carmine007 and @deepkkapur with ideas and suggestions for the type of content you'd like to see. We want to hear from you!\n\n\nLinks:\n\nService Fabric Repo: http://aka.ms/SFRepo \n\nSumukh's code related to this conversation: \n\nLogging Replicator: https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric/tree/master/src/prod/src/data/txnreplicator/loggingreplicator\n\nTransaction Replicator: https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric/tree/master/src/prod/src/data/txnreplicator\n\nService Fabric Subsystem Explorer: https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric/blob/master/docs/architecture"
