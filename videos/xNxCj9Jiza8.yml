description: "Performance. A word programmers use so often it's almost a buzzword. But in our world of web apps written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript it can mean many different, sometimes contradictory things.\n\nIn this presentation I will talk about the most common targets of web app performance, the techniques used to optimize them and how they influence each other. Additionally, I will discuss several performance targets that are mostly overlooked even though they arguably matter most.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGhx/"
