description: "Are you a developer who's stuck behind a firewalled environment? How about a corporate environment with a lot red tape and access issues to get through? Some of us Rails developers don't have the luxury to work in a truly open environment where one can 'gem install rspec' and viola! we have testing. So what do we do about that? How do we use RVM to manage our gemsets and Ruby versions behind these restrictions? What about deployments? Is Capistrano even a viable option? I've been on a successful Rails project for two years that's had to tackle these kinds of questions. In this talk, I'll discuss my solutions to these problems so your project can be effective and efficient without any sacrifices. I'll discuss how to install and manage RVM in firewalled environments, use Capistrano for remote deployments, how to test your email notifications when your SMTP server is locked down, how to use Git when no Git hosting is available, and plenty of other topics.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGaN/"
