title: 'Ruby Conf 12 - Tokaido: Making Ruby Better on OS X by Yehuda Katz'
recordingDate: 1352495677
description: "Last summer, I worked on a project that aimed to improve the experience of working with Ruby on OSX. Tokaido is a multifaceted project: it involved creating a portable binary build, a UI for working with Ruby-based web projects in development mode, and helping gem authors distribute their gems as precompiled binaries.\n\nThe ultimate goal: make it easy for Mac users to program with Ruby without needing to install and maintain a host of unrelated development tools.\n\nIn this talk, I will cover the basic architecture of Tokaido, and talk about what I learned about building and distributing Ruby during the process. This talk will cover some interesting low-level details of how Ruby loads and executes native code, and why I chose static linking for Tokaido. If you haven't given much thought to how \"native gems\" work in Ruby, you'll learn something from this talk.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGfX/"
