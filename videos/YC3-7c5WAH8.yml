description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/materials/ \n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT: \n\nWith the astonishing rate of new and modified malware samples being released daily, automation of analysis is needed to classify and cluster together similar samples, exclude basic and uninteresting variations, and focus costly manual analysis work on novel and interesting features (e.g., added or remove pieces of code with a given semantic). We will discuss the challenges in analyzing large malware datasets in a (semi)automatic fashion, and some recent research results that may help with the task, by leveraging the concept of \"behavior\" applied to malicious code.\n\nABOUT STEFANO ZANERO\n\nStefano Zanero received a PhD in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Milano, where he is currently an assistant professor. His research focuses on intrusion detection, malware analysis, and systems security. Besides teaching \"Computer Security\" at Politecnico, he has an extensive speaking and training experience in Italy and abroad. He co-authored over 40 scientific papers and books. He is an associate editor for the \"Journal in computer virology\". He's a Senior Member of the IEEE (covering volunteer positions at national and regional level), the IEEE Computer Society (for which he is the current chair of the Italy chapter), of the ACM and of ISSA (Information System Security Association). He currently sits in the International Board of Directors of the ISSA. Stefano has co-founded two startups, and is an active entrepreneur and business angel."
