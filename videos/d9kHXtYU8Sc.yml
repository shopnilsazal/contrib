A lot of metrics.\n\nThis is our story of the challenges weâ€™ve faced at Booking.com and how we made our Graphite system handle millions of metrics per second.\n\nYou will learn about one of the most high load Graphite-compatible stacks, the problems it poses and the challenges in maintaining it and scaling it further, pushing Graphite to its limits and beyond.\n\nSystem Administrators and SREs who are interested in monitoring and scalability would find this useful.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
