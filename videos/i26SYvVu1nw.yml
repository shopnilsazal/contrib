title: 'GopherCon 2014 Making Docker GO: Why One of the Fastest Growing Open Source Projects by Victor Vieux'
recordingDate: 1400513931
description: "Docker is one of the faster growing open source project. Less than 5 months after launching, the project had 60K+ users, over 6000 github stars, over 100 derivative projects, and over 150 significant contributors from around the world. Docker has been integrated into a number of key projects (Chef, Puppet, Jenkins, Travis, Vagrant, OpenStack), and has been deployed at some of the largest web properties, stirring hype and controversy in the open-source community in the process. But what the hell does a \"container engine\" do, and why is everyone so excited?\n\nIn this presentation, Victor Vieux, one of the core engineer of Docker, will explain the philosophy and history behind Docker, show examples of the projects built by the Docker ecosystem, and paint a picture of how Docker can change the way we think about software distribution and deployment. He will also speak about the rationale for writing Docker in Go, and the impact that has has on the project growth. In the presentation, he will show a number of examples, including how to build a open source playground for Go.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0C/"
