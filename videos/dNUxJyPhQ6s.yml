description: "Do you dream about life without unexpected nulls? Do you fancy a little bit of functional programming?

Less boilerplate, more safety. And you can introduce it in your project class after class, module after module, without risky revolution.\n\nI will show you pros and cons of Kotlin, based on last 8 months of my experience. In November 2016 I started a new backend project built on top of Gradle and Spring. Today I still do not regret the decision to write it in Kotlin. Let's see if I convince you! :-)"
