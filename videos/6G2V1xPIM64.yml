description: "Sean Rees, Google\n\nThe job of a technical lead (TL) is probably not what you think it is.\n\nThe role of a TL in a team is as much about fostering social bonds as it is about technical excellence. For a tech lead, it's not enough to be a technical expert, they must also foster unity within a team so they can move forward—together—towards the same goal.\n\nThis talk will (quickly) cover the role of a tech lead, some myths about tech leads, interactions/overlaps with other team roles (e.g; manager, individual contributor), and how to best make use of your own TL.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
