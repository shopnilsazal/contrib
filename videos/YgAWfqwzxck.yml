description: "by  Dieter Plaetinck\r\nI will describe how the design ideas and implementation of Uzbl are radically different from other (even \"lightweight\") browsers. Why this is important and which advantages this brings for hackers and control freaks. I will demonstrate how one can leverage these properties to integrate webbrowsing with other activities and vice versa, by using simple scripts and tools. \r\n\r\nUzbl is: \r\n\r\n◦uzbl-core: a small program providing a UI to interact with webpages, a means to report events and send commands \r\n◦uzbl-browser: a complete browser implementation based on uzbl-core and various scripts providing commonly used features. \r\n◦many more scripts providing tabs, download managers etc\r\nLinks:\r\n◦http://www.uzbl.org \r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
