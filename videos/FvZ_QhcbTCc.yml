description: 'When entering the world of functional programming, one is quickly introduced with a concept of a Monad. Concept that is for some reason really hard to grasp and comprehend. When querying the Internet for "What is a Monad?" you will most likely learn that "you do not need to know the category theory to understand monads" and that "you are not asking the right question". The first thing that came to my mind, when I was struggling with this dilemma, was "Well, what is the right question then?". This talk is all about looking for that right question and answering it. After this talk I hope you will find yourself knowing and understanding the concept, being able to apply it in a daily programming routine.'
