We’ll have an overview of Visual Studio and Xamarin tools to design cross-platform UI (based on Xamarin Forms) and we’ll go a little deep on the optimal architecture to adopt (MVVM and other design patterns) to enable code sharing and reuse between Android, iOS and Windows, analyzing a sample native application with cloud backend/API.'
