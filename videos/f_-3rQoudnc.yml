title: 'Bringing Your Data Pipeline into The Machine Learning Era - Chris Gaun & Jörg Schad, Mesosphere'
recordingDate: 1525675401
description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nBringing Your Data Pipeline into The Machine Learning Era - Chris Gaun, Mesosphere (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nKubeflow is a new tool that makes it easy to run distributed machine learning solutions (e.g. Tensorflow) on Kubernetes. However, much of the data that can feed machine learning algorithms is already in existing distributed data stores. This presentation shows how to connect existing distributed data services running on Apache Mesos to Tensorflow on Kubernetes using the Kubeflow tool. Chris Gaun will show you how this existing data can now leverage machine learning, such as Tensorflow, on Kubernetes using the Kubeflow tool. These lessons can be extrapolated to any local distributed data.\n\nAbout Chris\nChris Gaun is a CNCF ambassador and product marketing manager at Mesosphere. He has presented at Kubecon in 2016 and has put on over 40 free Kubernetes workshops across US and EU in 2017.\n\nAbout Jörg\nHe is a technical lead at Mesosphere"
