description: "In this 2015 GDC talk, Bungie's Tom Slattery explains why Bungie assembled its own internal localization team, and how this--along with adherence to a strict set of guiding principles for crafting a localization-friendly shared world--allowed it to overcome localization challenges efficiently while holding the quality of this nascent global brand to an uncompromisingly high bar.\n \nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
