recordingDate: 1423776081
description: "By: Alistair Cockburn, Ahmed Sidky\n\nIs Certification important? Well that is a debatable topic that can take days and months to conclude. The fact is that for some people, in some cultures, and for some organizations certifications are important and have value; that is a fact. Our goal at the International Consortium for Agile (ICAgile) is to develop a certification program that truly adds value and assesses the skill set as well as knowledge of the individual before calling them certified anything. With this mission in mind, we have spent the last numerous months developing a strong certification program for the agile community. The objective behind this session is to introduce the new certification program and hear your feedback and opinions about it."
