description: 'I always wanted to be the type of android developer that creates single Activity applications. Only issue was my inability to understand any libraries for accomplishing my goal. After a few iterations I landed on an architecture that''s based on mvp and reactive state which allowed me to accomplish my goal without anything more than rxjava and a few base classes. Come join me as I go through creating a single activity flow consisting of many screens and not a fragment in sight.'
