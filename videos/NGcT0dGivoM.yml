description: "By, Ben Dixon\nDocker has taken the world by storm as a tool for deploying applications, but it can be used for much more than that. We wanted to provide our students with fully functioning cloud development environments, including shells, to make teaching Ruby easier.\n\nLearn how we orchestrate the containers running these development environments and manage the underlying cluster all using a pure ruby toolchain and how deep integration between Rails and Docker has allowed us to provide a unique experience for people learning Ruby online.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/G6rE/"
