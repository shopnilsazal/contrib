title: 'Orchestration and CI/CD with Ansible and OpenStack by Simone Soldateschi'
recordingDate: 1438602790
description: "This project will demonstrate how to leverage CI/CD pipelines, to deploy and rollback applications in the Openstack Cloud. Best-practices allow to automate tasks and achieve high-degree of repeatability and robustness.\r\n\r\nJenkins will be used to implement continuous integration and continuous delivery jobs and pipelines. Packer will create images of disposable systems, being containers and Cloud servers.\r\nAnsible will be used to both create images with Packer, and eventually orchestrate provisioning of systems in staging and production environments in a blue-green fashion.\r\n\r\nDeep knowledge of deployment and workflow allows to continuously refine the process, adapt it to custom requirements, and make it smoother.\r\n\r\nThe following technologies will be presented:\r\n\r\n- Ansible\r\n- Docker on CoreOS cluster\r\n- Git repository\r\n- Jenkins\r\n- Openstack\r\n- Packer\r\n- Vagrant\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nJuly 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
