description: "Due to technical difficulties the audio had to be taken from the camera. We apologize for the poor audio quality.\n\nThe future of Deployment in Elixir by Paul Schoenfelder\n\nThis talk will cover the current state of releases in Elixir, where things are headed with exrm, and how releases are making their way into Elixir itself. We will also see how releases fit into the current deployment landscape with the proliferation of containerized infrastructure; and approaches to deploying clusters of nodes with releases. I'll cover the approaches I've taken at work, lessons learned, and tools that can help."
