description: "Fernando Masanori Ashikaga - Data Structures with Python\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n[Education Summit]\n\nData Structures is traditionally a “bogeyman” discipline in Computer\nScience courses and has a high degree of failure. In FATEC São José\ndos Campos we are adopting a hybrid approach, with C and Python\nlanguages. The failure rate decreased from 85% (2008) to 12% (2014).\nThe talk will be extensively illustrated with code in C and Python,\naddressing the various concepts taught in this course: recursion,\nlinked lists, queues, stacks, sorting algorithms."
