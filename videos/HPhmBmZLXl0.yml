description: "Theo Schlossnagle, Circonus\n\nOver the last twenty years, complex distributed systems have been deployed to solve the leading challenges in the systems resiliency and robustness realm. At this point in systems architecture design, distributed systems are everywhere in everything; even the most simple architectures incorporate distributed software and carry with that the failure scenarios they bring.\n\nSREs are put in an even more complicated situation, because of their wide net or responsibilities, to manage distributed systems of distributed systems. Things can and will go wrong and one of the fundamental skills for SREs going forward will be strong distributed systems reasoning skills.\n\nIn this talk we discuss the types of failure scenarios that distributed systems bring with them (with anecdotes) and develop various reasoning skills that can be used to tackle these challenges with increased confidence.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
