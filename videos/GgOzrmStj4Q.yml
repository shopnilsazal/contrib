description: "“It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” -W. Edwards Deming\n\nWork takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage.\n\nBut velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this updated talk, we'll look at centralized configuration, service registration and discovery, and reliability patterns, as before, but expand to also include new coverage of Kotlin, reactive programming with project Reactor and Spring Boot 2.0, updates in Spring Cloud Finchley, messaging with Apache Kafka, Micrometer.io-based observability, serverless with Spring Cloud Function and edge-services with Spring Cloud Gateway."
