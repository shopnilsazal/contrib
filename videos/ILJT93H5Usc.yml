Crack All The Things!\nRyan Reynolds Manager, Security and Privacy at Crowe Horwath LLP\nJonathan Claudius Security Researcher, Spiderlabs Research, Trustwave\n\nThe precursor to cracking any password is getting the right hash. In this talk we are going to cover how we discovered that Cain and Able, Creddump, Metasploit and other hash extraction tools regularly yield corrupt hashes that cannot be cracked. We will take a deep dive into password extraction mechanics, the birth of a viral logic flaw that started it all and how to prevent corrupt hashes. At the conclusion of this talk we will release patches that prevent hash corruption in these tools that many security professionals use every day.\n\nRyan Reynolds has been with Crowe for five years and is the Manager responsible for Crowe's Penetration Testing services. Ryan has a wide range of knowledge and experience in system administration and networking to include security applications and controls. He is a technical lead for engagements including application, network and infrastructure penetration testing on both internal and external systems as well as social engineering & physical security assessments.\nTwitter: @reynoldsrb\n\nJonathan Claudius is a Security Researcher at Trustwave.
