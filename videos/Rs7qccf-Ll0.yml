description: "\"Infrastructure design patterns with Python, Buildbot, and Linux Containers\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-12 - PyCharm Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nIn today’s world of fast-paced development, infrastructure can get left behind quickly, leading to a potential increase in technical debt. Buildbot is normally known to be a continuous integration (CI) framework built in Python, but can be refashioned to solve infrastructure design patterns that arise in enterprise or production and deployment situations. Using Python and native Buildbot components paired with Linux Containers, patterns such as license management, resource allocation, load balancing, and enterprise application deployment can be architected quickly with room for expansion as one’s needs grow.\n\nLearn how to move past the CI mindset and construct infrastructure needs with Buildbot and popular Linux Containers such as Docker and ClearContainers. Attendees will learn the best known methods of configuring Buildbot in non-CI implementations, and how to utilize the framework components for future needs.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
