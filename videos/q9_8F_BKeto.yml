description: "Chris Paget - Extreme-Range RFID Tracking\nIf you think that RFID tags can only be read a few inches away from a reader you haven't met EPC Gen2, the tag that can be found in Enhanced Drivers Licenses - this 900MHz tag is readable from 30 feet with off-the-shelf equipment. Without amplifying the signal from a commercial reader we were able to equal the previous Defcon record of 69 feet, and with less than $1000 of equipment we achieved considerably further than that. This talk covers everything you'll need to know to read federally-issued RFID tags at extreme ranges and explores the consequences to personal privacy of being able to do so.\n\nChris Paget has over a decade of experience as an information security consultant and technical trainer for a wide range of financial, online, and software companies. Chris' work is increasingly hardware-focused, recently covering technologies such as GSM and RFID at venues such as Defcon and Shmoocon. With a wide range of experience encompassing software, networks, radio, cryptography and electronics, Chris enjoys looking at complex systems in unusual ways to find creative attacks and solutions.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
