description: 'Serverless is a new framework that allows developers to easily harness AWS Lambda and Api Gateway to build and deploy full fledged API services without needing to deal with any ops level overhead or paying for servers when they''re not in use. It''s kinda like Heroku on-demand for single functions.'
