During her academic studies (M.Sc. in Information Management Engineering and B.Sc. in Physics) Shmuela had combined her passions of coding and teaching as a software developer, teaching assistant, science museum guide, and researcher. Today she continues to enjoy these activities developing with Angular and sharing her knowledge and experience in meetups and conferences. Shmuela lives in Tel Aviv with her husband Haggai, their deaf dog Ziggi, and one-eyed cat Franco.\n\nForm of Art: Validation in Angular Forms\n\nThe Angular teams puts a lot of effort for making front-end development easy and enjoyable for us. The Forms Module is a great example - simple to use, wide range of options, understandable API. Usually the biggest pain in forms is validation. But in Angular forms, this is one of the biggest strengths. In this talk Shmuela will show how to leverage the forms validation capabilities and write your own validation methods, to ensure your users get the most satisfying experience."
