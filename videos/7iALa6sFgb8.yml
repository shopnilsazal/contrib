Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nMaking Big Data Processing Portable. The Story of Apache Beam and gRPC - Ismaël Mejía, Talend (Any Skill Level)\n\nBig data applications have been an almost exclusive domain of Java and Scala developers. This not only frustrates engineers who prefer other languages and their ecosystems, but also impedes companies that already have their business logic written on other platforms from achieving the benefits of reuse when they build data-intensive applications. In this talk we introduce Apache Beam. A unified programming model designed to provide efficient and portable data processing pipelines. We will discuss in detail how Beam achieves portability by relying in two concepts: (1) Runners that translate the Beam's model so it can be executed in existing systems like Apache Spark and Apache Flink and (2) the portability APIs, an architecture of gRPC services that coordinate the execution of pipelines in containers to accomplish language portability.\n\nAbout Ismaël\nSoftware Engineer with more than ten years of experience designing and developing information systems for financial groups, telecom companies and startups. Focused on Big Data and Cloud architectures (aka Distributed Systems). He works at Talend France as an Open Source Software Engineer. He is an Apache Beam committer and PMC member and an enthusiastic contributor to multiple open source projects."
