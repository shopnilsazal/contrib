description: "By Justin Gordon\n\nLet's take some tangled code and untangle it together! We'll improve some model, controller and view code by applying view concerns, helpers, Draper decorators, presenters, and service objects. In doing so, you'll better understand where and when to use these techniques to make your code DRY'er, simpler, and easier to test. As a bonus, you'll also see how RubyMine with VIM bindings boosts refactoring productivity.\n\nJustin, aka @railsonmaui, is freelance Rails programmer and the technical evangelist for RubyMine. Passionately writing software since 1985, and focusing on Rails since 2011, he has a popular technical blog at http://www.railsonmaui.com. Degrees include a BA, Harvard and a MBA, UC Berkeley.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1e/"
