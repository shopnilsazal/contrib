description: "The talk “Storytelling in software development” by Christina Hauk and Thomas Goldberger is, on the one hand, about storytelling in general, and, on the other hand, about how storytelling can be used in software development life cycle. The end goal is to create easier to read and more understandable code. Storytelling is already a very popular tool in advertisement, because it transfers emotions through recognizable scenarios.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
