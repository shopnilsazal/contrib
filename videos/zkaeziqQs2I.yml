description: "By Davy Stevenson \nDevelopers are encouraged, and sometimes required, to study Computer Science, however a large percentage of us are self-taught or have entered programming through related fields. This sits in stark contrast to most other engineering disciplines, and this diversity is possibly our greatest strength.\n\nProgramming sits at the intersection of science, art, and craft. I contend that, given introspection on each of these facets, we will all improve. Learn how formal Computer Science techniques map to real-world problems. Contemplate code as an art form. Think of code as your craft, and continue learning new techniques. Take the time to look at problems through many lenses, and form diverse teams that allow us to solve problems from many different angles.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG11/"
