description: "React has popularized the idea of user interfaces as pure functions of application state, an approach which is perfectly suited for a language like PureScript. In this workshop, we'll learn how to use React and PureScript to create clean, well-factored web applications. This workshop assumes only basic knowledge of PureScript (or a related language such as Haskell), and for that reason, it can be considered a continuation of the earlier PureScript workshop for beginners.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Hbtc/"
