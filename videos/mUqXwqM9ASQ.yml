description: "by Sebastian MÃ¼ller\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThis talk copes with the signal analysis toolbox gr-inspector for GNU Radio. Iwill talk about the development process as well as the functionality and someusage examples.\n\nReceiving unknown signals is hard. It was already possible with GNU Radio, butmuch manual work and offline tweaking was necessary. Real-time signal analysiswas hardly possible. During Google Summer of Code 2016, gr-inspector wasdeveloped to make these tasks more easy. The main purpose of the toolbox is toautomate as much of a receiving process as possible during runtime. Thecomponents of the toolbox include a energy detection block, automated down-mixing/filtering/decimation, resampling, automated modulation classification(AMC) and OFDM parameter estimation/synchronization. Also, a GUI is able todisplay the analysis results. In this talk, I will give information about thebackground of the toolbox, what it's capable of and how to use it.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 15:15:00"
