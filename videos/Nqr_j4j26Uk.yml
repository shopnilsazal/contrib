description: "Rails: the result of magical incantations, voodoo, and wizardry? Or: a collection of patterns from the most awesomest language in the world (Ruby)?

In the workshop, participants will create their own Ruby object implementing these magical powers.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGa4/"
