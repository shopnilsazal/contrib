title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2018 - Xavier Ho - Let''s Make Functional Generative Art'
recordingDate: 1530234002
description: "Programming generative art, also known as creative coding, is often a trial-and-error process, combining creativity and logic to present something aesthetic. However, creative coding has a high barrier to entry due to the breadth of knowledge and coding skills required. This talk aims to lower that barrier for you to take home and practice creative coding.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn about algorithms and techniques for generative art using a pure functional paradigm. First, shepherding random numbers to simulate the universality of nature patterns that appear in plants, rocks, sand, and smoke. Next, using L-system formal grammar to create a seemingly infinite, but well-structured, series of graphics. Lastly, interfacing with printers to bring your drawing to life.\n\nFor you to get the most out of this talk, you should be comfortable working in a functional language of your choice. Although I will introduce some theory, background in mathematics and formal theory is not required to attend.\n\nXavier publishes network visualisation and games studies, and conduct research in roguelike games and participants at game jams at Design Lab, the University of Sydney.\n\nHis day job as a Software Crafter focuses on high-impact, real-time data visualisation, data-driven engineering, and design. His recent project with CSIRO's TraNSIT was recommended by the Office of Northern Australia, and my team won the Australian Governmentâ€™s Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper. He is currently working at Data61.\n\nHe participates in numerous public speaking events with over 50 public talks, including 2 invited seminars at UNSW and Monash University. \n\nYou can find him on Twitter (@Xavier_Ho), Github (@Spaxe), and reach me by email contact@xavierho.com.\n\nFor more on YOW!
