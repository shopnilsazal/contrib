title: 'Lone Star Ruby Conference 2011 Testing Javascript with Jasmine by Tim Tyrrell'
recordingDate: 1369718284
description: "A lot of developers do an excellent job of unit testing their server-side logic but then leave their client-side javascript as the new \"spaghetti code\" dumping ground and it doesn't have to be that way! Jasmine is a simple DOM-less javascript testing framework with a familiar RSpec-like syntax that removes most excuses for not testing your code. You will get an overview of Jasmine and how to utilize it in a variety of project environments from vanilla javascript to Rails to jQuery plugins. We will also explore where CoffeeScript and some helper libraries fit into making the testing of your javascript as simple and pleasurable as possible.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG9g/"
