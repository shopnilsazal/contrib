description: 'Yes, we did, we made our own DEF CON black badges. Why? Because we didn''t want to wait in line ever again-- Not really. We are a bunch of hackers that always look for a challenge, and what better challenge is there than to try and reverse engineer from scratch three DEF CON black badges? In this talk we will go through the 2 year long process of making the DC14, DC22 and DC23 Black badges which include amazing hacking techniques like social engineering, patience, reverse engineering, EAGLE trickery, head to desk banging and hoping it is passable to a goon and not shameful to DT, 1057, and Joe.'
