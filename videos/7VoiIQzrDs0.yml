description: "10 More Lessons Learned from Building Real-Life ML Systems: A year ago I presented a collection of 10 lessons in MLConf. These goal of the presentation was to highlight some of the practical issues that ML practitioners encounter in the field, many of which are not included in traditional textbooks and courses. The original 10 lessons included some related to issues such as feature complexity, sampling, regularization, distributing/parallelizing algorithms, or how to think about offline vs. online computation.\n\nSince that presentation and associated material was published, I have been asked to complement it with more/newer material. In this talk I will present 10 new lessons that not only build upon the original ones, but also relate to my recent experiences at Quora. I will talk about the importance of metrics, training data, and debuggability of ML systems. I will also describe how to combine supervised and non-supervised approaches or the role of ensembles in practical ML systems."
