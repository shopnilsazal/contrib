description: "By Jano Gonzalez\n\nInside every programmer there are two conflicting personalities, a hacker who gets things done quickly but sometimes leaves a messy codebase behind and a perfectionist who crafts beautiful code but sometimes gets paralyzed finding the best solution.\n\nIn this talk you will not only be exposed to this crazy theory but also will know how Ruby encourages the cooperation between those internal programmers. Starting from syntax and moving to higher level topics like structured vs OOP vs functional approaches to problems.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4g/"
