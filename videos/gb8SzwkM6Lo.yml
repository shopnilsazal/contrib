description: "# New Sectional Tags\n- Last week we discussed display types. One of the main display types is Display: block. Remember that Block elements are intended to separate content. And remember that one of the principals of html5 is to not reinvent the wheel. It turns out that there are some very common conventions in web design and content strategy. So html5 offers some new ways to markup these conventions without changing the way things are done.\n\n- An example is a website header. Before html5 we would put our header content in a div with a class called \"header\". Now HTML5 gives us the header element to throw all that crap in.\n\n- This is more semantic, and makes our content more transportable, so that when your content is served on a device viewport other than a browser, it can know that this content is definitely header content, as opposed to a common div with a special class that it cannot understand. Another reason is that this makes the content much more understandable to search engines. And lastly everyone in the web dev community knows unequivocally what a header tag is, versus a convention that I made up that you may not understand.\n\n## The Tags\n- So header is the first one I wanted to tell you about. Others are section, article, aside, figure, footer, and nav.\n\n- Im including a link in the notes below that has a more exhaustive list, so check that out. But I wanted to point out that a large part of the new HTML5 tags are just more block-level sectioning tags that are more semantically defined.\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document#The_HTML5_Outline_Algorithm\n\nhttp://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png\n\n\n# The Awesome Anchor\n- In our last video we talked about how block level elements can contain inline elements, but inline elements are meant to contain data, and not sectional tags like divs and the new ones we just discussed.\n\n- HTML5 gives us an awesome exception. New in HTML5 the a tag is permitted to contain larger sections and such. This makes total sense as soon as you want to make an entire box a clickable link, but before HTML5 that was a no no. \n\n- So go ahead, wrap that whole div and all its contents in an anchor tag. Or better yet, don't use a div at all a smart programmer will just use the a as a block level container, using css to change the a tag from display inline, to display block.\n\n- I use this method on my website, here on the homepage I made all of these blocks out of links, this way they are all easily more clickable and the markup is more clean than wrapping another block level element in an awkward a tag, just to make it clickable.\n\n- I like using as few tags as reasonably possible when I mark things up. Unnecessary markup is amateurish, and we are better than that.\n\n\n\n# Forms\n- Ok, another important subset of tags that are new to HTML5 are new form elements. Forms have come very far in html5, as they are very important. I've heard an argument that they are the most important tags in HTML as they are the only real way that users are enabled to interact with websites, wether that's composing a tweet, or buying some useless junk on ebay. So there  are a lot of awesome things there. Link below for that too.\n\nhttp://diveintohtml5.info/forms.html\n\n- Read through these things I'm linking to. Srsly.\n\n\n\n# Media\nThe last group of tags I want to touch on today that are new and shiny to HTML5 are media type tags.\n\n- In the first video of this series we talked about how the Mosaic  web browser introduced us to embedding images on the web. That was 1993. 20 years ago.\n\n- HTMl5 finally gives us a native way to imbed other media types like Audio and Video. Before this we had to use flash or other plugin-based solutions. No more sir. We've gone native with that shizz.\n\n\n\nThis is the last video in a series called \"HTML5 Basics\" Be sure to watch them all!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzzGt7EmXVw&feature=c4-overview-vl&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KlJn1pMYPVV3eYzxJlWcON"
