description: "The character of Ellie in The Last of Us presented a challenge to Naughty Dog. The game was centered on the player's relationship with her, and the team needed to ensure that the systematic presentation of the character was in line with what was presented by the narrative. In this GDC 2014 talk, Naughty Dog's Max Dyckhoff discusses the techniques used to generate a believable \"buddy\" AI character.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
