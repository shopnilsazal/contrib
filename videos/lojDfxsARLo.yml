title: 'Gathering stock data with Python following the demise of Yahoo Finance (Cameron Nugent)'
recordingDate: 1523133196
description: "For many years numerous Python textbook examples have used the Yahoo Finance API as a data source for stock information. With Yahoo's abrupt end to this free service earlier this year, people have been forced to turn elsewhere for free and easily accessible sources of stock price data. Data source such as Google Finance and libraries like pandas_datareader are filling the gap, but functionality is often limited to American stock markets, or locked behind API access keys. This talk aims to discuss this changing landscape and discuss a simple set of python web scraping functions that one can use to access stock data for Canadian and international stock markets using Google Finance.\n\nPresentation page -- https://2017.pycon.ca/schedule/54/"
