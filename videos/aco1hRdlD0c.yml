description: "Find more information here: http://droidcon.de/session/how-and-why-use-app-indexing-your-app\n\nApp Indexing is a technology provided by Google to index app content on Android like websites and to open Google search results directly in-app. This talk will give an overview about App Indexing and deep links both from a technical and user experience side.\n\nUsing an example app and sample code, attendees will learn about the technical implementation and set-up required to create deep links. \n\nFurther we will explore how we will implement App Indexing for the Wire app and our learnings from it. What are the benefits it can bring if users have your app installed anyway? How does the experience differ from opening mobile web content? How do results get measured?"
