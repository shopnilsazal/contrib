description: "\"You read the comments?!\" Absolutely! It's a fact: being a content creator opens you up to vicious, anonymous negativity that can make a person weep and clear out the whiskey section at the local grocer. Let's give our collective livers a break, shall we? Nika Harper has braved YouTube comments and forum posts for years, and using logic and empathy, this GDC 2014 talk helps you craft mental armor that can resist flames and save money on therapy bills.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
