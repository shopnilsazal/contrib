Since the receipt was stored inside the PLC used by the machinery some SCADA hacking was required.\n\nThe talk will run through the preparation steps required to perform the physical intrusion and the process for the creation of an attack scenario to achieve the goal. The second part of the talk will focus on the attack against an Industrial Control System (ICS) devices that took place before the intrusion, and that enabled the hack of the stolen PLC to access the required asset.\n\n===\n\nMatteo is a security researcher enrolled in computer engineering course at Politecnico of Torino.
