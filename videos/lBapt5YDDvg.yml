description: "​Introducing Helix: High-Performance Ruby Made Easy by Godfrey Chan and Yehuda Katz\n\nThis is a sponsored talk by Skylight.\n\nWe got a good productivity boost by writing the original Skylight agent in Ruby, but over time, we couldn't implement all the desired features with its overhead. Ruby is fast enough... until it isn't.\n\nIntroducing Helix — an open-source toolkit for writing native Ruby extensions in Rust, extracted from our Featherweight Agent's DNA. Fast, reliable, productive — pick three. Come join us to find out how you can leverage this power in your Ruby apps and even help make Rails faster!\n\n(This is not a re-run of Godfrey's talk from last year.)"
