The Internet has provided an environment for open source software to prosper. Some would say the Internet and open source software are indistinguishable. From low level cryptography to critical services, the Internet’s foundation is built upon open source building blocks. These blocks are crumbling.\n\nThis presentation will tread through popular open source projects, common fallacies, peer into 0days, walk trends, and break code. When we are finished, you will be able to use the same techniques and tools to break or protect the Internet’s building blocks.\n\nJohn Menerick works on Security @ NetSuite. John’s interests include cracking clouds, modeling complex systems, developing massive software-defined infrastructures, and is the outlier in your risk model.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/aeonsf \nWeb: http://www.securesql.info"
