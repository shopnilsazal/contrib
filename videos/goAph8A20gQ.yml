description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nGrowing in Your Contributor Role â€“ Insights From a k8s Newcomer Working Within the Release Process - Tim Pepper, VMware (Beginner Skill Level)\n\nNew open source contributors often struggle to orient to a project&rsquo;s processes and cadence, and kubernetes is no different in this regard. Approaching such a large and dynamic project can be daunting. While a relative newcomer to the kubernetes project, the speaker has twenty plus years of open source developer experience from which to draw on within the 1.10 release team as bug triage shadow and for 1.11 as the bug triage lead. Embedded service to the community within the release team, especially in a cross-SIG bug-focused role, provides a unique opportunity for contributor insights. This is not a 1.10 release retrospective (see pres. by Jaice Singer DuMars &amp; Ihor Dvoretskyi), but the talk will walk through the release process, its phases, how the process is evolving through time and will use 1.10 specific examples to highlight areas ripe for new contributors to engage and grow.\n\nAbout Tim\nTim is a software engineer with over 20 years open source development experience. He is currently a member of VMware's Open Source Technology Center acting as an open source developer advocate and contributing to upstream projects such as kubernetes. In his past he's worked on the linux kernel, device drivers, distributions, software update, Android, OpenStack, and an open source golang based orchestrator for multi-tenant containers and VMs that wasn't kubernetes."
