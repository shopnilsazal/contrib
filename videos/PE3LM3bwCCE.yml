description: "Daan van Berkel is a enthusiastic software craftsman with a knack for presenting technical details in a clear and concise manner. Driven by the desire for understanding complex matters Daan is always on the lookout for innovative uses of software\n\nAda Lovelace: The first functional programmer\n\nAda Lovelace work on Charles Babbage's Analytic Engine was far ahead of her time. She matured the concept of an automatic calculator by writing source code for a machine that was not even build.\n\nIn this session we will take a closer look into that code and how it works. We will provide operational details of the Analytic Engine and learn how it can be programmed.\n\nWe will even discover if Ada Lovelace was perhaps the first functional programmer."
