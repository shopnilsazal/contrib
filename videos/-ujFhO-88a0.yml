recordingDate: 1383935012
description: "Jimi Fiekert - The Anatomy of Drug Testing\nThis talk will cover most of the basics and some of the advanced principles/procedures to how drug screening works. Areas of the subject that will be covered will be the legality of drugs, the legality of drug testing, methods of drug testing, sample types, and reliability.\n\nJimi Fiekert's bio: I am a graduate of Cincinnati Technical College with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technician (MLT), and certified by the American Society of Clinical Pathologists (ASCP). I am also certified by the Department of Transportation (DOT) in the collection of legal drug screens and the administration of Breath Alcohol Testing. On top of that, I have personally done more research into the field of drug testing and how drugs interact with our bodies beyond what I have needed to career-wise.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
