description: "Christian \"quaddi\" Dameff MD @CDameffMD\nJeff \"r3plicant\" Tully MD @JeffTullyMD\nPeter Hefley @PeterHefley\n\nWe live in a world shaped by the hacker ethos. Systems underlying the backbone of our daily lives - from government to finance to entertainment - have grown and evolved based in part on the ingenuity and input of people like you. What happens when we take that drive to understand, tinker, and (most of all) improve, and turn it towards the most complex system on Earth? Welcome to the world of biohacking. \n\nJoin two doctors/hackers and an infosec security pro as they take a deep dive into the realm of implantable mods, from the smallest DIY project to the cutting-edge in academic and industrial prototypes. This talk will also outline principles of successful human modification as well as highlight the need for caution at a time when innovation and imagination is pursued at the expense of security. But above all else, this talk is a celebration of the pioneering spirit of grinder culture and a call for hackers to continue to shape the future of what may be the most important movement in human history."
