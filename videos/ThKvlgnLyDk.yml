title: 'Asynchronous messages in Hangouts Chat (The G Suite Dev Show)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1530214476
description: "Hangouts Chat is more than just a messaging tool for user communication. It features a bot framework allowing developers to build bots that can retrieve information, automate tasks, or perform other heavy-lifting for users. While bots can respond synchronously to user requests, there are situations where asynchronous messages are needed. These include notifying users when long-running jobs have completed, alerts such as when a server goes down or when a new customer is added to the database. In this video, engineer Wesley Chun shows viewers the different ways the framework supports asynchronous messages and shows you how to use them.\n\n● The bots are coming!
