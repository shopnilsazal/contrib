title: 'GeeCON 2017: Charlie Gracie - Eclipse OMR your (J)VM toolkit'
recordingDate: 1502694906
description: 'JVM technologies such as garbage collection and just in time compilation, have been improved for decades and provide industry tested reliability and performance to the Java ecosystem. Recently, a lot of new languages have been written in Java to leverage this investment in JVMs. We believe it is possible for other languages to leverage the huge investment in JVM technology without necessarily becoming tied to the Java Language or the JVM itself. In March 2016, the Eclipse OMR (https://github.com/eclipse/omr) open source project was created. The Eclipse OMR project consists of a highly integrated set of open source C and C++ components that can be used to build robust language runtimes that will support many different hardware and operating system platforms. The components in Eclipse OMR were donated from the IBM J9 Java VM. I will discuss the different technologies available in OMR and their capabilities. The technologies include garbage collection, compiler (JIT), RAS and diagnostic tools. During this talk I will also discuss the languages consuming OMR and other runtime proof of concepts we have been working on to demonstrate the benefits of shared runtime technologies. The proof points include IBM J9 Java VM (soon to be open sourced as Open J9), Ruby MRI, SOM++, Lua Vermelha, CPython and Rosie Pattern language.'
