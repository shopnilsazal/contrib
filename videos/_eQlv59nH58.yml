description: "The Social Coding Contract by Justin Searls\n\nSocial coding revolutionized how we share useful code with others. Bundler, npm, and Github made publishing and consuming code so convenient that our dependencies have become smaller and more numerous. Nowadays, most projects quickly resemble a Jenga tower, with layer upon layer of poorly understood single points of failure.\nDespite our progress, weâ€™d benefit from pausing to reflect on our relationship with open source. Convenience and ego drive most open source adoption, but these shortsighted motivations raise long-term problems we need to clearly identify if we can ever hope to solve them.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GWaf/"
