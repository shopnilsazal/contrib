description: "UX for Cats and Dogs! by Joel Potischman\n\nDavid Burge described the internet as a worldwide cat picture distribution system. But historically humans have had to do all the work of taking those pictures ahead of time! I wanted to empower my three cats and one dog to take their own pictures and send them to me, but how do you design for cats and dogs?\n\nI will describe how I built a home photo booth from a Raspberry Pi, various electronic components, the Twilio API, and a ton of cat treats to allow my pets to send me selfies.\n\nIn a direct challenge to the demo gods, this talk will end with an attempt at a live text exchange with my pets from the stage!"
