description: "by JÃ¶rg Schad\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nIn the era of docker, big data and micro services it is really important todistribute your applications reasonable across your cluster and keep a goodoverview of all of your applications. This fact is well addressed, but itwould be great to utilize your cluster in that way, that you locate your datain the same cluster like the rest of your application landscape and share yourphysical resources all over your running applications, no matter if you areserving user requests, crunching data or calculating big graphs. For thisreason we brought the awesome graph database Neo4j to run natively on top ofApache Mesos and DC/OS. In this session we will see how easy it is to install,run, operate and scale out Neo4j Causal Clusters on top of Apache Mesos andDC/OS and which possibilities you have spanning big graphs across yourcluster.\n\n\nRoom: H.2214\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 16:10:00"
