description: "\"How to use pandas the wrong way\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-12 - Anfiteatro 1]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nUPDATE: slides and materials can be found at http://pietrobattiston.it/python:pycon#europython_rimini_july_2017\n\nThe pandas library represents a very efficient and convenient tool for data manipulation, but sometimes hides unexpected pitfalls which can arise in various and sometimes unintelligible ways.\n\nBy briefly referring to some aspects of the implementation, I will review specific situations in which a change of approach can make code based on pandas more robust, or more performant.\n\nSome examples:\n\ninefficient indexing\nmultiple dtypes and efficiency\nimplicit type casting\nHDF5 storage overhead\nGroupBy.apply()... when you don't actually need it\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
