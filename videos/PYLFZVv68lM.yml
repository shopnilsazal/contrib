description: "Extending the Kubernetes API: What the Docs Don't Tell You [I] - James Munnelly, Jetstack\n\nAt the heart of Kubernetes is its API. Whilst on the surface it may appear relatively simple to use, under the hood is a beast of complex conversions, codecs and generators. In this talk, I'll show you how the Kubernetes maintainers have created their own tooling to make this process easy when contributing to core, and how you can use this to build your own custom controllers, operators and API servers. I'll then demonstrate this technique with a pager extension to Kubernetes.\n\nAbout James Munnelly\nI'm a Solutions Engineer at Jetstack, which involves helping customers bend and break Kubernetes to their will. I've created a number of extensions to Kubernetes core, including cert-manager (a kube-lego successor), Navigator (DBaaS for Kubernetes), and built my own simple cloud provider for bare metal clusters. I mostly spend my time browsing GitHub and then tweeting about it"
