description: "Reduce Small-Team Culture Shock with Agile by Jamie Riedesel\n\nEver hire someone from a traditional IT organization who seemed like a great person, only to have them end up a sucking pit of negativity that had to be fired? Traditional IT can be an incredibly hostile environment, leading to survival strategies that arenâ€™t always compatible with small agile-based teams. In this session, I will show how these survival strategies came to be, and ways to deprogram them to reduce your recruiting churn. Better yet, the tools to do so are already in agile.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/J48O/"
