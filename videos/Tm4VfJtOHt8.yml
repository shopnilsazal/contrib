Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nBuilding a Cloud Native Culture in an Enterprise - Deep Kapadia & Tony Li, The New York Times Company (Any Skill Level)\n\nThe New York Times has been on the Internet since 1996. Long before most Internet or tech giants even existed. The Times is one of the most trafficked news sites on the Internet today with a fairly complex set of services and modules driving our internet presence. We have been using public clouds since 2010 but In 2016 we decided to go all in with the intent to retire our data centers in 2018. As a result one of the biggest projects we undertook was moving our website, CMS and a slew of other internal tools to Amazon and Google's cloud offering. We jumped on the Kubernetes bandwagon and have had a hell of a ride. A lot of our learnings were not technical but cultural. As we went down this path, we found ourselves embracing open standards and tools. We also had learned how to work with product teams who were at various levels of maturity and discipline w.r.t. CI/CD and SRE concepts.\n\nAbout Tony\nI am an engineer on the Delivery and Site Reliability Engineering team at The New York Times, building tools, creating processes, and writing documentation for our many teams of developers. I am currently working on establishing best practices and platforms (Prometheus) to support teams in monitoring and instrumenting their services. Before that I worked on providing the CI/CD platform (Drone) for the organization and developing the launch strategies (Kubernetes) for our datacenter to the cloud migration. The most interesting aspect of my job is organizing and scaling these things to and across an enterprise level organization in production ready states.\n\nAbout Deep\nDeep runs the Delivery Engineering team, responsible for developer tooling and automation, test automation and Site Reliability functions at The New York Times. The New York Times recently underwent a significant transition by moving their entire infrastructure from their data centers to the public cloud. As a part of this migration one of the most significant projects they undertook was to work with the web frameworks and feature teams to move nytimes.com to Kubernetes (GKE specifically). Previous speaking experience: Deep has been a speaker at the MongoDB conference in 2012 in the past as well as appeared recently on the GCP Podcast to talk about the adoption of Kubernetes and other Cloud Native tools at The New York Times."
