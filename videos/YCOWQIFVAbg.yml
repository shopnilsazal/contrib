description: "kubeadm Cluster Creation Internals: From Self-Hosting to Upgradability and HA [A] - Lucas Käldström, Student\n\nkubeadm is the Kubernetes tool that helps you set up a Kubernetes cluster quickly and easily. kubeadm is different from other Kubernetes setup tools in that it doesn’t assume or depend on any special infrastructure. It assumes that you have one or more machine available and those machines can connect to each other via the network.\n\nThe master plan is to make kubeadm work both as the “fast path” to getting a best-practice Kubernetes cluster with a couple of easy-to-remember commands and as a toolbox for higher-level solutions like GKE, kops and Tectonic.\n\nBut how does kubeadm actually set up a cluster? How is it so easy to add a node with the Bootstrap Token? How does it self-host the control plane? How does it upgrade clusters smoothly with only one command? What is the plan for achieving HA without relying on any external infrastructure?\n\nAfter this talk, you will be able to describe how:\nkubeadm runs the different tasks in different stages\nthe network traffic between the cluster components flow\nself-hosting of the control plane works\nthe Bootstrap Token works\nthe `kubeadm upgrade` command works\nkubeadm will support multiple masters that are dynamically rotated\nyou can extend kubeadm to build your higher-level Kubernetes deployment tool\n\nAbout Lucas Käldström\nLucas is a passionate Kubernetes Maintainer and CNCF Ambassador that is excited about all things cloud native. Lucas has been engaged in Kubernetes work for about two years now and been involved in work like porting Kubernetes to multiple platforms, getting Minikube off the ground, being a core contributor in SIG Cluster Lifecycle and maintaining kubeadm. Besides Upper Secondary School Lucas runs a consulting company for Cloud Native tech programming tasks."
