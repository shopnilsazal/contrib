This move came as the result of a general shift towards Microservices and agile software development, which included major reorganization of teams and architectures. In this talk we describe the journey starting with the needs of the enterprise over the selection of Kubernetes and partners towards globally distributed microservices. We explain the challenges and pains we had to go through both organizationally as well as technically to arrive at production systems being live (and staying up) for end-of-year sales.\n\nAbout Oliver\nHusband, Father of 3, Internet Entrepreneur since 1996, developer whisperer, geek, compulsive first adopter, co-founder @giantswarm, conference speaker and moderator Cologne, Germany.\n\nAbout Daniel\nPlatform Engineer helping adidas to move to modern software architectures and transform to a true agile and DevOps focused organization.
