recordingDate: 1528727609
description: "In this session, we will take a deep dive into how audio is processed and prepared by the Android system. Having understood that, we can then dive into what is necessary in order to optimize playing sounds with low latency and minimal silence. \n\nThere are multiple options when implementing audio for your app, such as SoundPool, MediaPlayer and ExoPlayer. \nWe’ll examine the APIs available in each of the options to see what is and isn’t possible. Having understood the different options and restraints available for audio playback, we can then dive into the Android source code to see interesting ways that Android handles different audio streams. \n\nBy the end of the session, attendees should have a clear understanding of how audio is processed on Android, and how to best implement audio playback for their own application’s needs."
