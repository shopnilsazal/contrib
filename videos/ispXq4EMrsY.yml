description: "Dude, WTF in my car? \nALBERTO GARCIA ILLERA \nJAVIER VAZQUEZ VIDAL\n\nThe ECU tuning market is weird. There is little help from people in it, and most of the equipment is expensive. Well, not anymore! After hacking some equipment worth thousands of dollars, a new toy was born. Seed/Key algos broken, RSA busted√ñ We will learn all about Bosch EDC15 and EDC16 car ECUs. How they communicate, what protocols they use, their security and why it is worth hacking them. There will be a demonstration of a tool that does all of these, and costs less than $25 to build.\n\nAlberto Garcia Illera (@algillera) is a 25 year old who is passionate about hacking and social engineering. Alberto studied mathematics and computer systems in Spain and has spent the past several years working as a professional penetration tester. Alberto has presented at several seminars where he has helped teach hacking techniques to large companies such as Microsoft, the Spanish government and the cyberterrorism Spanish police department. At DEF CON 20 in Las Vegas, Alberto has presented a talk titled \"How to hack all the transport networks of a country\" that had a great repercussion. He has also spoken at ZeroNights in Moscow, BlackHat in Abu Dhabi and recently in Infiltrate in Miami.\n\nJavier Vazquez Vidal AKA Bi0H4z4rD is a hardware security specialist. He has been involved in several reversing projects that go from a simple IP camera to the well known PS3. He has worked for Airbus Military among other companies.\n\nHe studied Electromechanics and Telecommunications, developing a passion for electronics and technology since his youth.\n\nAt this time, he will be presenting his first public work, the ecu tool.\n\nMaterials: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Illera-Vidal/DEFCON-21-Illera-Vidal-Dude-WTF-in-My-Car-Extras-Updated.txt \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Illera-Vidal/DEFCON-21-Illera-Vidal-Dude-WTF-in-My-Car-Updated.pdf"
