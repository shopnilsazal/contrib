language: English
recordingDate: 1508189535
description: "Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) for IT systems has been around quite a while, but what about Industrial Control Systems (ICS)? This talk will explore the basics of DFIR for embedded devices used in critical infrastructure such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), and controllers. If these are compromised or even have a misoperation, we will show what files, firmware, memory dumps, physical conditions, and other data can be analyzed in embedded systems to determine the root cause. \n\nThis talk will show examples of what and how to collect forensics data from two popular RTUs that are used in Electric Substations: the General Electric D20MX and the Schweitzer Engineering Labs SEL-3530 RTAC.\n\nThis talk will not cover Windows or *nixbased devices such as Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) or gateways."
