title: 'Christine Doig - Reproducible Multi language Data Science with Conda'
recordingDate: 1430492543
description: "PyData Dallas 2015\n\nReproducibility is one of the main principles of the scientific method to ensure that our analysis and results are reproducible by anyone. As Data Science projects grow in variety (applications, libraries, standalone analysis...) and complexity (DBs, computing engines, multiple programming languages, backwards incompatibilities...) we need solutions to handle reproducibility in every case. In this talk, we'll explore how Conda, a cross-platform package manager written in Python can make our lives simpler and our Data Science projects easily shareable and reproducible.\nView slides from the presentation here: http://chdoig.github.io/pydata2015-dallas-conda/#/"
