description: "PyData London 2014\n\nMaking product decisions is hard - often, we take one step forward, but two steps back. We need to become scientists about our own product - run an AB test comparing two versions and measure which works better. We'll talk through a simple but effective backend AB testing framework in Python (using Django as an example), along with some of the issues, gotchas and best practices of running AB tests in production."
