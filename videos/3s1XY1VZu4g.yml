description: "Design and Implementation of a Quantum True Random Number Generator\nSean Boyce Security Researcher\n\nThe problem of generating \"reasonable\" approximations to random numbers has been solved quite some time ago... but this talk is not for reasonable people. Generating true random numbers with a deterministic system is impossible; and so we must drink deeply from the raw, godless chaos of quantum physics.\n\nThis talk will cover the various pitfalls of quantum true random number generator construction, including bias, statistical relatedness between bits, and unpleasant supply voltages. A working reference design that overcomes these hurdles will be described, and barring major disaster, demonstrated. Notably, this design contains a custom, fully solid-state particle detector that may be constructed for around USD 20$.\n\nTo benefit the most from this lecture, a very basic knowledge of statistics, particle physics, and/or analog electronics is ideal; however enough background will be provided that this will not be strictly necessary. If in doubt, the Wikipedia articles on quantum tunneling, alpha particle, normal distribution, operational amplifier, and hardware random number generator should provide more than sufficient background. Demo\n\nSean Boyce is a founding member of Foulab (www.foulab.org), the Montreal hackerspace, and holds a MSc in Renewable Resources. He studies tree diseases, and enjoys statistics. He has lived in a swamp for months, has genetically modified organisms twice, and has never taken a course in computers or engineering in his life. He only codes in assembly language, and to the best of his knowledge, is incapable of perceiving boredom. His next project is to start a custom flex-PCB printing business (Legion Heavy Industries) to cater to small orders from hobbyists and academia.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
