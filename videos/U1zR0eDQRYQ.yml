description: "Kubernetes Day 2: Cluster Operations [I] - Brandon Philips, CoreOS\n\nHow do you keep a Kubernetes cluster running long term? Just like any other service, you need a combination of monitoring, alerting, backup, upgrade, and infrastructure management strategies to make it happen. This talk will walk through and demonstrate the best practices for each of these questions and show off the latest tooling that makes it possible. The takeaway will be lessons and considerations that will influence the way you operate your own Kubernetes clusters.\n\nAbout Brandon Philips\nBrandon Philips is helping to build modern Linux server infrastructure at CoreOS as CTO. Prior to CoreOS, he worked at Rackspace hacking on cloud monitoring and was a Linux kernel developer at SUSE. As a graduate of Oregon State's Open Source Lab he is passionate about open source technologies."
