description: "by David Teller\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nRedox is an attempt to make a complete, fully-functioning, general-purposeoperating system with a focus on safety, freedom, reliability, correctness,and pragmatism.\n\nSo how do we get there? By keeping the kernel minimal, both in terms ofsyscalls and in terms of size. By writing the code in Rust, a modern, memory-safe and type-safe systems programming language. By maintaining minimalprivileges, through a general capability-based system.\n\nRedox is an ambitious project, but it already runs on real hardware. Let'stake a look.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 12:25:00"
