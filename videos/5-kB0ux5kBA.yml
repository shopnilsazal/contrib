title: 'GeeCON Prague 2017: Robert Munteanu - Scaling up development of a modular code base'
recordingDate: 1516816492
description: 'Microservices are quickly becoming one of the preferred deployment models in the software industry. Much has been said about the runtime impact of microservices, but less about how they impact the development process. This talk will discuss the details of moving from a single monolithic codebase to multiple repositories in terms of the development process. We will present the impact of modularisation on source control, continuous integration, code reviews, IDEs and public discussion on chat/email. After this talk attendees will have a better understanding on the impact of the development process of modular development.'
