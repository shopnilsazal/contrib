description: "Tanya Reilly, Google\n\nMost of us have a backup strategy, many of us have a restore strategy and several of us have a fully tested restore strategy. But backups are not the whole story. I'll talk about the parts of disaster recovery we're less prepared for, and dependencies that you might not think about until one day when you really do turn an entire service, entire site or (perish the thought!) an entire company off and on again.\n\nThis talk will cover managing complexity, testing your fallback plan and avoiding dependency cycles that make it impossible to restart groups of systems. Like, where do you store the documentation on how to recover the documentation server?\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
