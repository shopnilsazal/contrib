description: 'Is hacking in your blood? Do you see projects where others simply see problems?  If something is "broken," do you try to fix it yourself before you ask for help or consider throwing it away? That''s awesome, but, there are hurdles to face when embarking on projects... sometimes, the hardest problems to overcome happen right at the start: finding the right tools and parts to use!
