description: "By Richard Clayton\r\n\r\nThis talk will show you live examples of these sites, explain how they work, and tell you what we currently know about the criminals who operate them.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of evil things on the Internet if you know where to look for them. Phishing websites collect banking credentials; mule recruitment websites entice people into money laundering; fake escrow sites defraud the winners of online auctions; fake banks hold the cash for fake African dictators; and there are even Ponzi scheme websites where (almost) everyone knows that they're a scam. This talk will show you live examples of these sites, explain how they work, and tell you what we currently know about the criminals who operate them.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
