description: "Do you know how many Bluetooth-enabled devices are currently present in the world? With the beginning of the IoT (Internet of Things) and Smart Bluetooth (Low energy) we find in our hands almost a zillion of them. Are they secure? What if I tell you I can unlock your Smartphone? What if I tell you I'm able to open the new shiny SmartLock you are using to secure your house's door?\n\nIn this talk we will explain briefly how the Bluetooth (BDR/EDR/LE) protocols work, focusing on security aspects. We will show then some known vulnerabilities and finally we will consider deeply undisclosed ones, even with live demonstrations.\n\nSpeaker bios:\nMatteo Beccaro is a young security researcher. His interest focus on WiFi networks, networking and NFC implementations. He finished high school studies in July 2013 and actually he is a student at Politecnico di Torino in Computer Engineering course.\n\nHe has been selected as speaker at DEF CON 21, 30C3, BlackHat US Arsenal, DEF CON 22's Skytalks and BlackHat EU 2014 and Tetcon, for his research in vulnerabilities of NFC transport systems.\n\nSince 2013 he is also pentester and security engineer at Secure Network s.r.l. Since 2015 he is also technical leader of the Security Research Team of OPFOR, the physical security division of Secure Network s.r.l.\n\nTwitter: @_bughardy_\n\nMatteo Collura is a student of Electronics Engineering at Politecnico di Torino.
