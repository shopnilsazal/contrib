description: "CockroachDB aims to bring the best aspects of Google's next generation database, Spanner, to the rest of the world via open source. Databases should scale horizontally with minimum fuss, survive disasters of all sorts including datacenter outages, and provide the right primitives so that developers can build applications, not workarounds. \n\nLearn about the design of CockroachDB and how you can use it to easily build scalable, resilient applications in Go that can be deployed to any cloud infrastructure seamlessly."
