description: "RESTful APIs reign supreme! No longer do developers have to put up with SOAP\nand XML-RPC and those bulky, schema laden exchanges. JSON maps almost directly\nto python and we're flying again!\n\nOver time the chaos of free form JSON representations has subsided and a number\nof best practices have appeared such that we now expect certain patterns when\nencountering a new JSON REST API. The next step is to standardize these\npractices and start offering the predictability and code reuse we lost years\nago.\n\nThe talk will provide an overview of current attempts at standardizing JSON\nexchanges such as jsonapi, jsonhome and jsonschema.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nJuly 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
