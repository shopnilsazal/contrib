description: "Recently, an anonymous open source developer decides to remove his code (left-pad) from a public repository. Shortly thereafter, several large organizations felt the impact of his actions. Facebook, AirBnB and others experienced errors impacting the functionality of their services. Packages using 'left-pad' wouldn't properly execute.\nToday, we embrace both the open source community and the growth of open source projects, modules and packages but  dependencies and recursive dependencies might become a risk or even a new attack vector which we didn't foresee.\n\nCould there be other cases of common and popular open source packages depending on open source modules that might not be there tomorrow or, even worse, could they be maliciously modified?\n\nJoin us and learn:\n- Which common open source packages might not be there tomorrow and how this can affect you?\n- How packages you use could be maliciously modified impact on your app\n- How intertwined and complex dependencies have become\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
