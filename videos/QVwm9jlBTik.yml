description: "http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/david-turner\n\nAt Lambda Days 2017 David will talk about some of the history of functional programming languages and how it reflects what are still live issues of language design.\n\nTopics will include:\n\n*    what did LISP and Algol 60 each get wrong and get right back in 1960 \n*    the advantages and disadvantages of lazy evaluation \n*    run time typing (as in Erlang) versus static typing (as in Haskell)"
