description: "Free monads, generic programming, fix-points and coproducts of data types are usually considered advanced topics for a Haskell programmer. In this talk we will look at these concepts from an unifying lens: combining and enriching pattern functors. A pattern functor is the stripped-down description of a data type: only the shape of the constructors remain, but all the recursive structure is gone. Using Haskell, we can manipulate pattern functors to create new data types at will.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HdBZ/"
