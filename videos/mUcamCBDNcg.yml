description: "Augmenting Human Decision Making with Data Science by Kelsey Pedersen\n\nHumans and data science are flawed on their own. Humans lack the ability to process large volumes of information. Machines lack intuition, empathy and nuance. You’ll learn how to guide users of expert-use systems by applying data science to their user experience. Layering data science within our systems allows us to take advantage of the human-touch while leveraging our large data sets. In this talk, you’ll learn the process for sprinkling data science into your applications, the challenges we have faced along the way, and how to measure the business impact."
