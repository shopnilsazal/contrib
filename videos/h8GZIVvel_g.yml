recordingDate: 1383938328
description: "Iftach Ian Amit - Cyber[Crime|War] Charting Dangerous Waters\nCyberWar has been a controversial topic in the past few years. Some say the the mere term is an error. CyberCrime on the other hand has been a major source of concern, as lack of jurisdiction and law enforcement have made it one of organized crime's best sources of income.\n\nIn this talk we will explore the uncharted waters between CyberCrime and CyberWarfare, while mapping out the key players (mostly on the state side) and how past events can be linked to the use of syndicated CyberCrime organization when carrying out attacks on the opposition.\n\nWe will discuss the connections between standard warfare (kinetic) and how modern campaigns use cybersecurity to its advantage and as an integral part of it.\n\nWith more than 10 years of experience in the information security industry, Iftach Ian Amit brings a mixture of software development, OS, network and Web security expertise as a Managing Partner of the top-tier security consulting and research firm Security & Innovation. Prior to Security & Innovation, Ian was the Director of Security Research for the Content Security Business Unit at Aladdin Knowledge Systems, where he created the AIRC (Attack Intelligence Research Center). Prior to joining Aladdin, Amit was Director of Security Research at a global Internet security company, leading its security research while positioning it as a leader in the Web security market. Amit has also held leadership roles as founder and CTO of a security startup in the IDS/IPS arena, developing new techniques for attack interception, and director at Datavantage responsible for software development and information security, as well as designing and building a financial datacenter. Prior to Datavantage, he managed the Internet application and UNIX worldwide. Amit holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Business Administration from the Interdisciplinary Center at Herzlya.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
