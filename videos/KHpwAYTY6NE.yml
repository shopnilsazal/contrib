description: "Toool, Deviant Ollam, Dave, Dr. Tran & Ray - The Search for Perfect Handcuffs... and the Perfect Handcuff Key\n\nThe few handcuff talks which have appeared at conferences in the past have focused mostly on how these restraints function and how to open them without a key. While this talk is no exception (going into great detail about the specialized anti-pick protections used by many brands) we will also reveal the product of ongoing, precision research that TOOOL members have conducted.\n\nDid you know that although there is a ?standard? size and shape for basic handcuff keys, every manufacturer has variations, special features, and sizing issues that make creating a single, universal key quite difficult? In our talk, we will explain how to create this type of \"ultimate\" key that opens all major brands of handcuff, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. The Ã¼ber key is verified as working with...\n\nSmith & Wesson (USA)\nPeerless (USA)\nASP (USA)\nChicago (USA)\nWinchester (USA)\nHiatt-Thompson (UK)\nRBS (UK)\nKyoung Chang (Korea)\nYuil (Korea)\nRepublic Arms (South Africa)\n... and more!\n\nWe have the math, we have the means, and will demonstrate to everyone how to obtain the best handcuff key you might ever own!\n\nTOOOL\nThe Open Organization of Lockpickers is a non-profit sportpicking group dedicated to the advancement of the general public knowledge about locks and lockpicking. By examining locks, safes, and other such hardware and by publicly discussing our findings we hope to strip away the mystery with which so many of these products are imbued.\n\nThe more that people know about lock technology, the better they are capable of understanding how and where certain weaknesses are present. This makes them well-equipped to participate in sportpicking endeavors and also helps them simply be better consumers in the marketplace, making decisions based on sound fact and research.\n\nDeviant Ollam While paying the bills as a security auditor and penetration testing consultant with The CORE Group, Deviant Ollam is also a member of the Board of Directors of the US division of TOOOL, The Open Organization of Lockpickers. Every year at DEFCON and ShmooCon Deviant runs the Lockpicking Village, and he has conducted physical security training sessions at Black Hat, DeepSec, ToorCon, HackCon, ShakaCon, HackInTheBox, CanSecWest, ekoparty, and the United States Military Academy at West Point. His favorite Amendments to the US Constitution are, in no particular order, the 1st, 2nd, 9th, & 10th.\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
