recordingDate: 1394818962
description: "By Hector Castro\n\nMost Computer Science curriculums offer at least one course that focuses on databases. Most of the time, these courses promote relational database management systems (RDBMS) by emphasizing the relational model, relational algebra, data normalization, and Structured Query Language (SQL). \n\nKey/value data stores are increasing in popularity but our mental model for storing data is still primarily relational. \n\nIn this talk, we'll explore data modeling for key/value stores using the Uber mobile application as an example.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG3z/"
