description: "String Theory and Time Travel: the humble text editor by Colin Fulton\n\nDid you know that the time machine in your text editor is probably broken? Better yet, have you considered that your text editor has a time machine?\n\nThe majority of our day is spent in a text editor, but most never think about how they really work. There is a lot more to an editor than saving a few keystrokes or the rivalry between Vim and Emacs; they can teach us about data structures, IO, design, and the dangers of time travel.\n\nLet's take a closer look at some of the most enduring applications, and see what we can learn by trying to build a better editor using Ruby.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H5Qq/"
