description: "Sue Lueder, Google\n\nIn 2015, Google SRE's BreakFix team set out on an exciting journey of reading and cataloging thousands of postmortems in an effort to mine useful data.\n\nThis effort has come a long way since then. In this talk, we will cover how Google used a structured data approach in incident data analysis, what we were able to unlock in the process, and what tools made it all possible."
