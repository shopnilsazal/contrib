description: "RubyConf 2016 - Just a Ruby Minute by Andrew Faraday\n\nJust a Minute is a game show that's a part of the British national consciousness, delighting audiences across the country for almost half a century. In it, speakers are challenged to speak for one minute without hesitation, repetition or deviation, it's much harder than it sounds. It's fast paced, funny, insightful and you might even learn something."
