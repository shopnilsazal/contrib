description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2016 in Washington, DC\nhttps://2016.appsecusa.org/\n\nPractical tips for web application security in the age of agile and DevOps\n\n\nThe SDLC has been the standard model for web application security over the last decade and beyond, focussing heavily on gatekeeping controls like static analysis and dynamic scanning. However, the SDLC was originally designed in a world of Waterfall development and its heavy weight controls often cause more problems than they solve in todays world of agile, DevOps, and CI/CD. \n\nThis talk will share practical lessons learned on the most effective application security techniques in todays increasingly rapid world of application creation and delivery. Specifically, it will cover how to: \n1) Adapt traditionally heavyweight controls like static analysis and dynamic scanning to lightweight efforts that work in modern development and deployment practices\n2) Obtain visibility to enable, rather than hinder, development and DevOps teams ability to iterate quickly \n3) Measure maturity of your organizations security efforts in a non-theoretical way\n\n\nZane Lackey\nFounder/Chief Security Officer, Signal Sciences\nZane Lackey is the Founder/Chief Security Officer at Signal Sciences and serves on the Advisory Boards of the Internet Bug Bounty Program and the US State Department-backed Open Technology Fund.
