description: "The Haskell community is often abuzz about free monads and if you stick around for long enough you'll also see notions of free monoids, free functors, yoneda/coyoneda, free seminearrings, etc. Clearly \"freedom\" is a larger concept than just Free f a ~ f (Free f) + a. This talk explores briefly the origins of \"freedom\" in Category Theory, explains what it means for you to have a \"free X\" for any thing X, and talks a little bit about some useful free structures which exist in Haskell.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HcNk/"
