description: "Juliette Reinders Folmer \n\nFor any application with even the remotest ambition of international use, the only way to go is to use UTF-8. And even without that ambition, using UTF-8 might still bring you more benefits than you currently realize. Unfortunately most developers at one point or another run into problems implementing UTF-8 and get discouraged. That ends now! In this talk I will cover UTF-8 from the basic linguistics, through client-side aspects to all the steps you need to take to tackle the most common (and some more obscure) issues when using UTF-8 in a database driven web application.\n\nhttps://joind.in/talk/view/11233\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/jrf/everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-utf-8-but-never-dared-to-ask-1"
