title: 'EmberConf 2014 - Snappy Means Happy: Performance in Ember Apps by Matthew Beale'
recordingDate: 1398360352
description: "By Matthew Beale\n\nEmber is fast. Ember Core is working hard to make Ember even faster. So why does your app drag?\n\nThe performance of a single-page app is impacted by the performance characteristics of its foundational parts: Persistence, the DOM, and JavaScript. Ember provides tools to manage these cornerstones, but with the tradeoff of introducing its own characteristics.\n\nIn this talk, we will use the source of real, shipped Ember apps (and of Ember itself) to diagnose, understand, and improve slow interactions. The Chrome developer tools and Ember instrumentation will help us understand slow code paths and identify opportunities for improvement. Along the way, we will learn how parts of Ember work at the macro and micro level and learn how the framework helps us manage performance challenges in a browser environment.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2O/"
