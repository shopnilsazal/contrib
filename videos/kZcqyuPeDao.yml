description: "RubyConf 2016 -  Halve Your Memory Usage With These 12 Weird Tricks by Nate Berkopec\n\nHow does Ruby allocate memory? Ever wonder why that poor application of yours is using hundreds of megabytes of RAM? Ruby's garbage collector means that we don't have to worry about allocating memory in our programs, but an understanding of how C Ruby uses memory can help us avoid bloat and even write faster programs. We'll talk about what causes memory allocation, how the garbage collector works, and how to measure memory activity in our own Ruby programs."
