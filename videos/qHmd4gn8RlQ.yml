description: "By Daniel Stone\r\n\r\nThere are a few niggles about X11 today that mean every embedded device vendor patches the server in various unpleasant ways, whereas on the desktop it just looks suboptimal and we suck it up.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover a few parts of X11, such as client-side cursors, the video API, Composite, RandR, which currently need to be improved to make X11 look as good as it possibly can, without going to Wayland or X12.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
