description: "Deterministic Solutions to Intermittent Failures by Tim Mertens\n\nMonday mornings are bad when the coffee runs out, but they’re even worse when all of your impossible to reproduce, “flaky” tests decide to detonate at the same time.\n\nJoin us to learn a systematic, proven workflow for expertly debugging any test failure including consistent, order-related, and non-deterministic failures. We’ll discuss the importance of fixing intermittent failures before they reach critical mass and why you should eradicate the term “flaky tests” from your vocabulary.\n\nDon’t wait for an emergency to prioritize fixing the ticking time bomb of intermittent test failure."
