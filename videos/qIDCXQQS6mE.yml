recordingDate: 1399018396
description: "This session pulls a variety of examples in testable development from O'Reilly's Continuous Enterprise Development in Java, including a review of the sections on:\n - RESTful services\n - UI verification\n - Transactions\n - Security\n...and covers other areas of the Java EE platform that have historically been branded as \"difficult to test.\" The session spends a lot of time in the IDE, with examples that are freely available to fork and run.\nIntervenant : Al Rubinger"
