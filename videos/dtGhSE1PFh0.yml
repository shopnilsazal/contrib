title: 'Eben Olson: Neural networks with Theano and Lasagne'
recordingDate: 1449251027
description: "PyData NYC 2015\n\nAn introduction to neural networks using the Theano computational library and the Lasagne framework. After introducing the basics of Theano, we will learn how to create, train and apply convolutional and recurrent neural networks using Lasagne. Several applications will be explored including image classification, language modeling, image captioning and art style transfer.\n\nLasagne, a lightweight framework built on Theano, makes it simple to define, train, and apply neural networks. The workshop will provide an introduction to these libraries, and a guided exploration of several interesting applications of convolutional and recurrent networks. Familiarity with Python and basic neural network terminology will be assumed (introductory materials will be available prior to the conference). An AWS instance with the necessary software and data will be provided for each participant.\n\nSyllabus:\nTheano basics\nSymbolic variables/tensors, expressions\nFunctions, shared variables and updates\nOverview of Lasagne\nLayer classes and building a network\nObjectives, optimizers, and training\nConvolutional neural networks\nImage classification\nFine-tuning a pretrained network\nStyle transfer (\"Neural Art\")\nRecurrent neural networks\nLanguage model (text generation)\nCNN + RNN (image captioning)\nExtending Lasagne\nDefining custom Layers\nQ&A / Audience topics"
