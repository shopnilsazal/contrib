NOT to be super 10x or anything - just to feel good and function well professionally.”\n\nFull threads here: \n🔗 https://twitter.com/mpjme/status/855691565460848640\n🔗 https://mastodon.cloud/@mpj/2592100\n\nI got almost a hundred replies, and wen’t through them and categorized them to see if any pattern stood out.
