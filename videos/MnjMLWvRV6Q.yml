description: "David Whale | Saturday 15:30 | Room D\n\nbitio is a small and simple Python package that enables your BBC micro:bit to become an input and output device for your main computer (PC/Mac/Raspberry Pi/Linux). It turns the BBC micro:bit into an interactive controller for any Python program, and is built on top of the successful MicroPython language that runs on the micro:bit - so, it's Python all the way!"
