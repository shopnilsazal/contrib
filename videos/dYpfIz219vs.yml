description: "Floris Bruynooghe - Advanced Uses of py.test Fixtures\n[EuroPython 2014]\n[23 July 2014]\n\nOne unique and powerful feature of py.test is the dependency injection\nof test fixtures using function arguments.  This talk aims to walk\nthrough py.test's fixture mechanism gradually introducing more complex\nuses and features.  This should lead to an understanding of the power\nof the fixture system and how to build complex but easily-managed test\nsuites using them.\n\n-----\n\nThis talks will assume some basic familiarity with the py.test\ntesting framework and explore only the fixture mechanism.  It will\nbuild up more complex examples which will lead up to touching on\nother plugin features of py.test.  It is expected people will be\nfamiliar with python features like functions as first-class objects,\nclosures etc."
