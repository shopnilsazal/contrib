Who can explain how the engine parses the given template and finally composes the HTML body?\n\nIn this session, I will dig into implementation details of several Ruby libraries such as ERB, Haml, Slim, Tilt, Temple, etc. and give you a quick tour into the world of template engines!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Fqsw/"
