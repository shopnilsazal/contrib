description: "Ruby developers have many great options for simply hosting their web applications. But what happens when your product outgrows Heroku? Managing your own servers can be an intimidating task for the average developer. This session will cover the lessons we've learned at Braintree from building and maintaining our infrastructure. It will cover how we leverage Ruby to automate and control all of our environments. Some specific topics we'll cover:\n* Orchestrating servers with capistrano \n* Using puppet for configuration management \n* Our cap and puppet workflow using git \n* How vagrant can provide a sane test environment \n* Some pitfalls you should avoid\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGaG/"
