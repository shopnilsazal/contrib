recordingDate: 1439509195
description: "The Junior Jump by Rebecca Poulson\n\nThe Junior Jump deals with a topic that is increasingly important to the Ruby community--onboarding new engineers into their first jobs. We’ll discuss how the interview stage can be used to design a roadmap for a new engineer’s early days, how to select meaningful and appropriate projects and how to come up with a mentorship model that works given the resources at your organization. We will here anecdotes from junior developers from diverse backgrounds (bootcamp and university grads as well as self taught programmers) and more senior developers with experience onboarding new engineers.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GxRq/"
