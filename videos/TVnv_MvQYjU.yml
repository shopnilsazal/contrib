title: 'Design in an Age of inclusivity - Faiz Malkani'
recordingDate: 1528721716
description: "Often, when product teams begin tackling a problem and enters the research and design phase, representations of the target audience called personas are created. These personas provide an abstraction of the users that the product is being built for. For example \"20-30 years old, female, interested in shopping trends\" sounds like one persona for an ecommerce product, but more often than not, these are idealistic abstractions, and are far from realistic.\n\nAt a closer look, the \"design for the user and all else will follow\" ideology breaks down. This topic aims to identify problems that real users face, from tech unfamiliarity and data connectivity, to colorblindness and phsyical limitations, and much more. The talk goes on to detail how product teams can identify such gaps in the product's design, how designers and developers can identify users with such limitations who have difficulty using products, and then adapt the user experience to an age of inclusivity, one where all types of users are welcome!"
