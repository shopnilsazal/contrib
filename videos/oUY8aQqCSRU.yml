description: 'Dr3t from DC 719 gives a talk on 3D printing, shows you a cool DEF CON ring they created as an example. More importantly he shows that what ever sector you work in or what ever you want to make, if you can visualize it, draw it and either CAD (Computer Aided Drafting) it or have someone else CAD it, then your ideas can become physical object. There are endless possibilities with this growing technology, become part of its growth and then share what you know.'
