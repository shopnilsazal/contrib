description: "HiveMind: Distributed File Storage Using JavaScript Botnets \nSEAN MALONE PRINCIPAL SECURITY CONSULTANT, FUSIONX\n\nSome data is too sensitive or volatile to store on systems you own. What if we could store it somewhere else without compromising the security or availability of the data, while leveraging intended functionality to do so? This presentation will cover the methodology and tools required to create a distributed file store built on top of a JavaScript botnet. This type of data storage offers redundancy, encryption, and plausible deniability, but still allows you to store a virtually unlimited amount of data in any type of file. They can seize your server -- but the data's not there!\n\nSean Malone has been building and breaking networks and applications for the last 12 years, and he has a diverse practical and academic background in information technology and security. As a Principal Consultant and the primary engagement manager for FusionX, Sean provides clients across all verticals with sophisticated adversary simulation assessments and strategic security guidance. Sean is a key member of the FusionX internal research and development team and his custom security assessment utilities are used in a majority of FusionX engagements. \nSeanTMalone.com \nLinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/in/seantmalone"
