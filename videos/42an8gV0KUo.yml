description: "Panel - Adversary Characterization and Scoring Systems\nAdversary Characterization and Scoring Systems\n\nCyber adversary characterization is a topic which was conceived by the panel members along side other members of the computer security and intelligence communities in an attempt to provide an accurate way to build profiles of cyber adversaries, much like the way in which criminal psychologists profile more traditional criminals.\n\nThe characterization metrics conceived attempt provide a characterization of both theoretical adversaries, classing them based on statistics harvested from the wild and an accurate way of characterizing an adversary at an incident response level by studying the methodologies used during the attack.\n\nThe panel will begin with an introduction to the topic, followed by in depth discussion regarding the various characterization metrics and their applications; toward the end, we will be taking questions from the floor."
