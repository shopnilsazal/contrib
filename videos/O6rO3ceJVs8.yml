description: "Matt Davis, OpenX\n\nWe all know the scenario: what was once an experiment soon becomes a desired product. Suddenly it's time to scale the system, and all the time we hear about running \"at scale,\" but what does that really mean? This talk is about the challenges OpenX faces when scaling a small proof-of-concept to a complex global product. It focuses on our strategies for planning, adapting, and growing distributed systems into fully productionized services."
