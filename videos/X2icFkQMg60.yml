title: 'Building Applications to Increase Kubernetes Adoption, and Make Life Easier - Kate Kuchin, Heptio'
recordingDate: 1525452401
description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nBuilding Applications to Increase Kubernetes Adoption, and Make Life Easier Once You've Adopted It - Kate Kuchin, Heptio (Any Skill Level)\n\nWeb UIs have the potential to both make experienced cluster administrators' jobs easier and help drive adoption of cloud-native technologies. So how do we build these interfaces? Kate will share what is needed to design and build user interfaces to make Kubernetes concepts more accessible to all experience levels. She will talk about how frontend engineers and designers can first ramp up on Kubernetes, so they understand the problem space. Once a product team is equipped with the knowledge to build tools, their next task is to define the problems that can be solved with a UI, and the ones that cannot. She will highlight the work her team at Heptio has done on Sonobuoy Scanner, a UI for running CNCF conformance tests, and other Heptio tools in the making. Lastly, she will speak to what problems (with potential UI solutions) still exist, and how we can work together to solve them.\n\nAbout Kate\nKate is a Software Engineer at Heptio, where she works on the UX team to build tools to make Kubernetes easier to adopt and use. She started her career at Google, where she worked on the Consumer Operations team of (the now sadly defunct) orkut. She has since worked at startups throughout the country, but is now settled in Oakland, where she spends her days working from home alongside her officemate, Helen the dog. This is her first time proposing a talk."
