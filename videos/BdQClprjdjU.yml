description: "Patrick Mühlbauer - Building nice command line interfaces - a look beyond the stdlib\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nOne of the problems programmers are most often faced with is the\nparsing and validation of command-line arguments. If you're new to\nPython or programming in general, you might start by parsing sys.argv.\nOr perhaps you might've already come across standard library solutions\nsuch as getopt, optparse or argparse in the official documentation.\nWhile these modules are probably preferable to parsing sys.argv\nyourself, you might wonder if there are more satisfactory solutions\noutside of the standard library. Well, yes there are!\n\nThis talk will give you an overview of some popular alternatives to\nthe standard library solutions (e.g. click, docopt and cliff), explain\ntheir basic concepts and differences and show how you can test your\nCLIs."
