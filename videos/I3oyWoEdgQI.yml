description: "by Nathaniel McCallum\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nIncreased uses of cryptography in web environments, particularlyauthentication, have driven a set of new RFCs: JSON Object Signing andEncryption. While these standard data formats have dominated web-basedapplications, they also have further applicability in a wide variety of non-web contexts. This talk will introduce you to José, a plug-able, open source Cimplementation of these RFCs which provides both an API for direct integrationand a usable command-line interface. We will discuss the techniques that weused to keep our API usable across all the possible input parameters and showexample of how you can implement José in your own infrastructure. We will alsodiscuss some of our plans for the future, including how you can helpcontribute.\n\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 14:30:00"
