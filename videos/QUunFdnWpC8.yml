description: "Dealing with real-time, in-memory, streaming data is a unique challenge and with the advent of the smartphone and IoT (trillions of internet connected devices), we are witnessing an exponential growth in data at scale. Learning how to implement architectures that handle real-time streaming data, where data is flowing constantly, and combine it with analysis and instant search capabilities is key for developing robust and scalable services and applications. In this university session, we will look at how to implement an architecture like this, using reactive open source frameworks. An architecture based on the Swiss rail transport system will be used throughout the university.\n\nTechnologies: Java (attendees must be comfortable with Java 8), Infinispan, Eclipse Vert.x, Apache Kafka, OpenShift."
