title: 'From Irrational Configuration System to Functional Data Store - Rob Martin'
recordingDate: 1446734224
description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/rob-martin\n\nWe started with 42 Oracle tables, 5200+ configuration values, no default values or templates, logical inconsistencies and circular dependencies, on-boarding times running as long as 10 months, a 1.5 million lines of legacy code, and advice that anyone who tries to redesign our configuration system will be gone within six months. Our solution is a custom-built functional data store with inheritance, flexible projections, backward compatibility with the legacy code, and a Legoâ„¢-like framework for building tools. Plus, I still work there. Come learn how we did it.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- I'd like to share how we replaced a complex, \"organically-designed\" configuration system that we couldn't reason about with a immutable, accretive, functional, time-variant data store based on event sources and command query responsibility segration. We're particularly happy with our choices to project views into Oracle and to treat Oracle as an event source (which gives us backward compatibility with our legacy code), and to allow queries that compile data from multiple documents (which gives us reusable configuration templates).\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Programmers and managers interested in applying functional programming concepts to data stores.\n\n\nAbout Rob\n\nRob Martin - software engineering manager, programmer, blacksmith, and hairy anarchoprimitivist wannabe - concocts mixtures of tech, community, and anarchy in his work and life. He writes and speaks on building teams, programs, and meaningful connections."
