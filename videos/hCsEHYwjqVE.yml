description: "Online games need robust, easy to use network APIs. JAM is World of Warcraft's inter-server serialization and routing layer. This 2013 talk from Blizzard's Joe Rumsey describes how JAM came to be, and how it is used today using real world sample code from WoW and other Blizzard projects to illustrate key concepts, such as machine generated code for serialization, and dynamic protocol negotiation. \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
