description: "Tales from Lastminute.com Machine Room: Our Journey Towards a Full On-Premise Kubernetes Architecture in Production [I] - Michele Orsi & Manuel Carlo Ranieri, lastminute.com\n\nWe sell travel services to more than 10 million customers worldwide in 15 languages across 35 countries, through hundreds of micro-services. \n\nWhat happens if you challenge the way you deliver your products with a new infrastructure based on Kubernetes? \nYou’ll have to face classical developing, deploying and monitoring paradigms and bring everything to an entirely different level. It will also have to kept in mind that the business expects continuous delivery of new features without impact on the final customers experience.\n\nIn this presentation we will explore our one-year-long journey to move a full business flow from a well-known legacy platform to Kubernetes through a seamless migration. \nWe’ll dive into the full tech stack, from the services we give to our development teams to the way we provision servers, without forgetting the secret sauce we applied to make it happen. \n\nWe will not hide the failures, the problems and the wrong assumptions we made along the way, but we will celebrate lessons learnt and the goal we achieved; allowing us to boost time-to-market and reliability of our systems.\n\nAbout Michele Orsi\nMichele is a software architect at lastminute.com group, where he’s part of the team who develops and builds the new cluster, based on containers and Kubernetes. He had been the founder and CTO of a startup called map2app for 4 years, until the acquisition in 2015. Prior to this he worked at European Space Agency, helping to launch and operate satellites. He loves to develop “beautiful” solutions that solve real-world problems in different languages. In his free time he loves to play volleyball and read books.\n\nAbout Manuel Carlo Ranieri\nManuel is a GNU/Linux enthusiast. Born to be a sysadmin, he started working with GNU/Linux two decades ago. His mantra comes from extreme laziness \"If you have to repeat it twice you must automatise it\". Manuel works for Lastminute.com as a site reliability engineer and Kubernetes craftsman and spends his free time climbing mountains."
