title: 'GeeCON 2017: Štěpán Šindelář - Truffle: your favorite language on JVM without compromises'
recordingDate: 1502694959
description: 'Graal/Truffle is a project that aims to build multi-language, multi-tenant, multi-threaded, multi-node, multi-tooling and multi-system environment on top of JVM. Imagine that in order to develop a (dynamic) language implementation all you need is to write its interpreter in Java and immediately you get amazing peek performance, choice of several carefully tuned garbage collectors, tooling support, high speed interoperability with other languages and more. In this talk we''ll take a look at how Truffle and Graal can achieve this and demonstrate the results on Ruby, JavaScript and R. Particular attention will be given to FastR the Truffle based R language implementation, its performance compared to GNU R and its support for Java interoperability including graphics.'
