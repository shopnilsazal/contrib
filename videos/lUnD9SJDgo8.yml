description: "Keynote: What's Next? Getting Excited about Kubernetes in 2018 - Clayton Coleman, Architect, Kubernetes and OpenShift, Red Hat\n\nThe Kubernetes ecosystem has grown tremendously over the last three years.  Each release pushes the boundaries of what we can accomplish and brings new participants and new success stories.  That success has a price: how do we do what's best for the community and for our users, and what's on deck for 2018?\n\nAbout Clayton Coleman\nClayton is architect and engineer on cloud orchestration and\ncontainers at Red Hat, in charge of both technical direction for\nKubernetes and OpenShift (Red Hat's platform as a service built on top of Kubernetes) as well as the broader container and container content efforts at Red Hat. Clayton is one of the top contributors to both Kubernetes and OpenShift and has been involved in many projects in the container, platform-as-a-service, and ci/cd ecosystem over the last four years. He enjoys sleeping, but rarely has time to do it anymore."
