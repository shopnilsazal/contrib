description: "ðŸ’– Support the show by becoming a Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/funfunfunction\n\nI stay productive on my projects by defining a clear *desire* and *outcome*, and then habitually using the outcome to generate the *next task*. A sentence for each project that describes a falsifiable outcome, my desire behind that outcome, and the small next task in order to make progress towards that outcome.\n\nðŸ”— Last weeks video mentioned in this video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQCsOymE2mE&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeH21VDycWYNWU7VKUA-xLzg\n\nðŸ”—  Why We Do What We Do (Book about Motivation that inspired the motivation parts)\nhttp://amzn.to/2lcXLsb\n\nðŸ”—  mpj on Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/mpjme\n\nðŸ”—  The camera I use\nhttp://amzn.to/2kwlpAD\n\nðŸ”—  The microphone and sound recorder I use\nhttp://amzn.to/2kwli8e\nhttp://amzn.to/2lcVSfd\n\nðŸ”—  The lights I use\nhttp://amzn.to/2ld8jrX"
