description: "By Brian Sam-Bodden\n\nAs Ruby Developer I've had a pretty involved relationship with my Mac. I own iPads and iPhones since Apple started to make them. A few years back I told myself I was going to build apps for the Mac/iPhone/iPad but then reality sunk in when I started learning Objective-C and using XCode. The environment (and the language) felt like a trip back to 1995.\nIf you are a Web developer used to working with dynamically-typed, lightweight languages, following agile practices like Test-Driven Development, and comfortable with a Unix Shell, then jumping into a development world with an ugly cousin of C++ and an IDE that looks like an F16 cockpit just doesn't seem appealing.\nLuckily for us there is an alternative in RubyMotion, a Ruby-based toolchain for iOS that brings a Ruby on Rails style of development to the world of iOS application development.\nIn this talk I will show you how you can use well engrained Ruby practices like TDD to build iOS Apps with RubyMotion.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG9Q/"
