description: "Lightning Talk: Cloud Native Design Patterns - Bilgin Ibryam, Red Hat\n\nThe way we design, develop and run applications on Cloud Native platforms differ significantly from other platforms. When working with Kubernetes, there are less concerns for developers to think about, but also there are new patterns and practices for solving every day challenges. In this talk, Iâ€™ll look at (very quickly) on a number of patterns and practices which are de facto way of developing Cloud Native applications. More specifically we will look at patterns such as:\n-- Creational Design Patterns\n-- Automatable Unit\n-- Predictable Resource Profile\n-- Declarative Deployment\n-- Declarative Scheduling\n-- Observable Interior\n-- Life Cycle Conformance\n-- Behavioral Design Patterns\n-- Managed SD and LB\n-- Managed Batch Jobs\n-- Managed Scheduled Jobs\n-- Stateful Services\n-- Daemon Services\n-- Singleton Services\n\nAbout Bilgin Ibryam\nBilgin Ibryam (@bibryam) is a Senior Middleware Architect at Red Hat and committer at ASF for Camel, OFBiz and Isis projects.
