description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Florina Muntenescu, Google.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-1\n\nAndroid Architecture Components is a set of libraries for designing great apps. It contains APIs for implementing concepts like Lifecycle and ViewModel.\nWhilst these APIs are great, they do come with some questions:\n• How do Lifecycle, LiveData and ViewModels work under the hood? How and where should each of them be used?\n• What is the difference between a ViewModel from Architecture Components and the one from the MVVM pattern?\n• Lifecycle components exist for Activities, Fragments and Application. Why don’t we have the same for Views?\n• Can we have ViewModels for Views also?\n• Is LiveData a replacement for RxJava? Can they live side by side?\n• How does LiveData work with DataBinding?\n• How should view state be handled and what goes into a Bundle versus a ViewModel?\nTo answer all of these questions and more we’ll do a deep dive in the internals of Lifecycle, LiveData and ViewModels.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
