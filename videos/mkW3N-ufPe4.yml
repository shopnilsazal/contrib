description: "DEF CON 16 - Eric Schmiedl: Advanced Physical Attacks: Going Beyond Social Engineering and Dumpster Diving, Or, Techniques of Industrial Espionage\nYour stack is smash-proof. Your dumpster is fully alarmed. And your firewall is so secure that it has former Soviet officials green with envy. So why are the developers finding their undocumented features in competitors' products, or company executives on a constant hunt for leaks and traitors? There's a whole lot more to doing an end-run around network security than calling up and pretending to be the help desk or hoping someone chucks a service manual in the trash Professional attackers with specific targets have a whole rash of techniques -- from using targeted employees to hiding microphones -- adopted from the world of espionage, and this talk is all about how they do what they do.\n\nEric Schmiedl has spoken on access control systems at BlackHat 2007 and safecracking at DEFCON 14. He is a member of the TOOOL.US Board of Directors, maintains a semblance of an undergraduate career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and has been picking locks all his life. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
