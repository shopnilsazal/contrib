description: "Ionel Cristian Mărieș - Less known packaging features and tricks\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nYou've been making packages for a while now. Everything works almost\nfine, however, lots of new features and tools have been developed\nrecently. Some are really obscure. And there's a chance they can save\nyou time and help you avoid _packaging-induced-pain_. I'm willing to\nbet couple of beers you haven't seen these features and/or tools\nbefore.\n\nThis talk is going to show you:\n\n- Patterns and tricks you can use in your `setup.py`.\n- Obscure pip/setuptools/virtualenv/python features you can use to\nimprove your packaging experience (be it as a user of packages or a\npackage author).\n- Fledgeling alternative tools.\n\n[Slides (HTML with notes)][1]\n\n[1]: http://blog.ionelmc.ro/presentations/packaging/"
