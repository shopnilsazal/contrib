description: "In this 2018 GDC session, Splatoon and Splatoon 2 producer Hisashi Nogami shared his experiences working with a design team whose goal was to create a game that was novel yet easy to grasp and riveting to play. What were the brainstorming sessions like and what kinds of review processes determined the game's final ideas? How do you make a sequel better while releasing it on a brand-new platform with unique features? And how do you land on a quirky concept like \"squid creatures fighting turf battles with water pistols\" in the first place? Mr. Nogami, who also served as director and lead artist on Nintendo's Animal Crossing series, dons his lab coat, roll up his sleeves, and divulges lessons learned while illustrating the importance of risk-taking.\n\nRegister for GDC: http://ubm.io/2gk5KTU\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
