description: 'Many hackers are familiar with the art of lockpicking... manipulating open a lock with small tools when you don''t have a key.  Many locks can indeed be opened in this fashion... in the end you still have a lock (albeit an open one) with no key.  What if you WANT the key itself?  Impressioning is the art of generating a working key from whole cloth... from the OUTSIDE of a locked door without any access to the internals or the original key.  Sounds crazy?  It''s entirely possible, and expert Jos Weyers will tell you how!'
