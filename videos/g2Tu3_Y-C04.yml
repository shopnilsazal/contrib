recordingDate: 1392969528
description: "Chris Hurley - Hardening Solaris Installs\nA step by step guide to hardening a Solaris installation. Focusing primarily on Solaris 8 but with concepts that apply to all Solaris/Unix installs, attendees will learn the steps that need to be taken to lock down a Solaris installation. While recognizing the best practice of pre-deployment hardening, the concepts presented also apply to already live Solaris installations. Rather than focusing on known attacks and reacting to them, this presentation will better equip system/security administrators to proactively reduce the risk of a successful attack against their systems.\n\nChris Hurley is a Senior Information Security Engineer working in the Washington DC area. Primarily focusing his efforts on vulnerability assessments, he also performs penetration testing, forensics and incident response operations. He has spoken at the IATF Forums in Washington DC and has written numerous whitepapers for both print publications and online security sites. Many of his papers can be found at his site SecurityTribe and also at Security Horizon. He has worked as a DefCon Goon for the past three years which probably explains both the bags under his eyes and the rubber truncheon in his hand."
