description: "Container Runtime and Image Format Standards - What it Means to be “OCI-Certified” [I] - Jeff Borek, IBM & Stephen Walli, Microsoft\n\nWith the proliferation and rapid growth of container-based solutions over the past few years— including container-based solutions from almost all major IT vendors, cloud providers, and emerging start-ups—the industry needed a standard on which to support container image formats and runtimes while also ensuring interoperability and neutrality. The Open Container Initiative (OCI) was launched with the goal of developing common, minimal, open standards and specifications around container technology without the fear of lock-in. OCI has recently issued v1.0 of its container image format and runtime specifications, which enable a consistent and stable platform for running containerized applications. \n\nThe next phase in ensuring broad adoption of common container image format and runtime specifications is the OCI Certification program, which will be launching soon. This session will provide an overview and goals of the program, factors to consider if becoming OCI-certified makes sense for your container project, how to get your container project OCI-certified, and how you might be able to gain interoperability benefits from OCI-certified solutions. This session will also include a demo of the OCI Image validator being run against container images from container image registries from multiple vendors. \n\nAbout Jeff Borek\nJeffrey Borek is a senior technology and communications executive with over twenty years of leadership and technical experience in the Software, Telecommunications, and Information Technology/Consulting industries.
