title: 'PyBots! or how to learn to stop worrying and love coding by Anna Gerber'
recordingDate: 1407559280
description: "In this talk, Anna will argue how physical computing — building interactive systems such as robots that sense and act upon, or respond to the physical world — provides an ideal application space for teaching and learning programming concepts and problem solving; that appeals to a diverse audience; and that can provide a positive introduction to the world of open source software and hardware.\r\n\r\nDrawing on her experiences teaching introductory programming with Arduino-based robots, Anna will step through a tutorial demonstrating how to develop a mobile PyBot - a robot programmed using Python and the Firmata protocol, and will provide tips to help you or the apprentice coders in your life to take the first steps towards a lifetime of loving to code.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nAugust 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
