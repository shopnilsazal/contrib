Even if you’d like to have an accessible application, you find roadblocks along the way: lack of documentation, push-back from product priorities, no standards for mobile devices, and perhaps most importantly, not understanding what users really want.\n\nAs Accessibility Lead for iTriage, Kelly has worked with advocacy groups such as the Blind Institute of Technology to uncover what makes an app truly accessible, and the actual developer time investment required. Spoiler alert: it’s easier than you might think!\n\nJoin us as we discuss common pain points suffered by some technology users, how the Android platform is quickly gaining on iOS in accessibility features, and how you can make your app accessible to all.  We’ll finish up with some code samples of common pain points and see how easily they can be fixed."
