title: 'Python Micro-service Architecture by Rory Hart'
recordingDate: 1408333799
description: "Micro or single-purpose service architecture is an server application design that utilises numerous lightweight service processes communicating with a simple API, often RESTful. This style of architecture has started being used in the past few years with the aim of increasing development velocity through flexibility.\n\nThis talk will examine the development workflows, tooling and libraries available in Python to make developing these services practical. Emphasis will be on technically addressing the weaknesses of this style of development in areas such as testing, deployment and communication.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nAugust 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
