description: "Peter Eckersley - How Unique Is Your Browser?\nThis talk reports the results of the panopticlick browser fingerprinting experiment. We show how inoccent-looking version and configuration information can be used to uniquely identify almost all desktop browsers, without use of cookies or IP addresses. We discuss how this comes about, how serious a problem it is, and just how hard it will be to fix...\n\nPeter Eckersley is a Senior Staff Technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. His research interests include digital copyright and alternatives to digital copyright, network neutrality and network testing, censorship circumvention and privacy enhancing technologies.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
