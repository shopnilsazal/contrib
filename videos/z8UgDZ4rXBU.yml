description: "Jafar Husain and Michael Paulson provide an inside like at Falcor - the open source data platform that powers Netflix UIs. Falcor lets you represent all of your cloud data sources as one virtual JSON model on the server. On the client, Falcor makes it appear as if the entire JSON model is available locally and allows you to access data the same way you would from an in-memory JSON object. Falcor retrieves any model data you request from the cloud on-demand, transparently handling all the network communication and keeping the server and client in sync.\n\nFollow FalcorJS at: https://twitter.com/falcorjs"
