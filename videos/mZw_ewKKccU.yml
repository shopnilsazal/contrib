This year’s exciting glimpse into psychology and its application to security is around the fun topic of decision-making. Psychologists estimate that we make thousands of decisions a day. THOUSANDS.

We all think we’re great decision makers, and we’re all wrong at some point in our lives. Join me to get a better understanding of how and why we make our choices, and what you can do to improve your skills and guide your users to a happier (and safer) place!\n\nBIO: Michele Fincher is the Chief Influencing Agent of Social-Engineer, Inc., possessing over 20 years experience as a behavioral scientist, researcher, and information security professional.
