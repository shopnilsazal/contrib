title: 'Architectures for Huge Angular Based Enterprise'
recordingDate: 1530190601
description: "Nowadays, we build large enterprise applications with Angular. But how to best structure such projects to ensure long-term maintainability and reusability? This session by Manfred Steyer provides multiple answers to this question. The audience explores how to split large projects into individually reusable npm packages and how to deploy them through an internal and public registry. As an alternative, it discusses the Monorepo approach that is used successfully by big companies like Google and Facebook and which compensates for some of the disadvantages of npm packages in internal projects.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
