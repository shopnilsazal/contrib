description: "We all know how painful is to be paged at 3 am because the site is not responding.\n\nNetflix has made popular the Circuit Breaker pattern, but that is just one of the stability patterns of Michael Nygard's \"Release it!\" book.\n\nOn this presentation, you will learn each of the stability patterns found in the \"Release it!\" book and we will look at practical examples of how they were applied while building a Java based system that integrates and mash up information from more than twenty different sources, some of them quite unreliable."
