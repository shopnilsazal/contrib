title: 'Oystein Kolsrud - Functional Programming for the Object Oriented'
recordingDate: 1463578312
description: 'Most modern programming languages have taken inspiration from the functional programming paradigm and have implemented features for making functional modelling easier. To be able to fully leverage the power of languages such as C#, it is therefore necessary to have an understanding of functional programming as well as other paradigms such as object orientation. This presentation gives an introduction to Haskell and compares it to the features provided in C# that have been influenced by concepts from the functional world. In particular, it aims to illustrate how a functional approach to solving problems differs from an object oriented approach.'
