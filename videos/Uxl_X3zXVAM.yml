description: "By, David Greenberg\nTypes remain a highly contentious issue for programmers in industry. Rails and Python have massive communities, and drive high-profile, high-traffic, successful businesses, such as GitHub, Reddit, and Dropbox. Clearly, dynamic languages are a better choice than Java or C; unless, of course, we count the myriad more businesses powered by 90s statically typed languages (e.g. Java). This statement will infuriate some engineers and academics, as we all know that Hindley-Milner type systems are the only type systems that reduce defects and improve code quality. In this talk, we'll take a look at type systems through a different lens: how type systems are actually a business decision that is frequently cast as an emotional decision."
