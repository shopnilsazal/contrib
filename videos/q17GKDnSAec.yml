description: "Cultivating Empathy by Dajana and Leslie Hawthorn\n\nDajana will be joined by Leslie Hawthorn to give this talk! \n\nWhen considering how to design products, teams or even common every day household objects, empathy doesn't end up on the required features list. Yet, without empathy, teams with enormous technical skills can fail in their quest to deliver quality products to their users. Incredible projects fail to create communities because they don't exercise it. Fail at empathy and your chances of failing at everything skyrocket.\n\nContrary to what you may have heard, empathy is not something you're innately born with - it's a skill that can be learned, cultivated, refined and taught to others. In this presentation, your lovely co-speakers will discuss the value of empathy, how you can cultivate in yourself and your organizational culture, and conclude with concrete steps for leveling up in your interactions with your fellow human beings."
