description: "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of Migrating Hundreds of Legacy Applications to Kubernetes [B] - Josef Adersberger, QAware\n\nRunning applications on Kubernetes can provide a lot of benefits: more dev speed, lower ops costs, and a higher elasticity & resiliency in production. Kubernetes is the place to be for cloud native apps. But what to do if you’ve no shiny new cloud native apps but a whole bunch of JEE legacy systems? No chance to leverage the advantages of Kubernetes? Yes you can! \n\nWe’re facing the challenge of migrating hundreds of JEE legacy applications of a major German insurance company onto a Kubernetes cluster within one year. We're now close to the finish line and it worked pretty well so far.\n\nThe talk will be about the lessons we've learned - the best practices and pitfalls we've discovered along our way. We'll provide our answers to life, the universe and a cloud native journey like:\n- What technical constraints of Kubernetes can be obstacles for applications and how to tackle these?\n- How to architect a landscape of hundreds of containerized applications with their surrounding infrastructure like DBs MQs and IAM and heavy requirements on security?\n- How to industrialize and govern the migration process?\n- How to leverage the possibilities of a cloud native platform like Kubernetes without challenging the tight timeline?\n\nAbout Josef Adersberger\nJosef Adersberger is #cloudnativenerd, CNCF member, and co-founder & CTO of QAware, an independent cloud native software manufacturer that has been repeatedly awarded Best IT Workplace in Germany. He studied computer science in Rosenheim and Munich and holds a doctoral degree in software engineering. He is a lecturer for cloud computing at several German universities."
