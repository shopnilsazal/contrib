recordingDate: 1528906411
description: "Istio integrates with a rich set of tools that can add tracing, telemetry, logging and other functionalities to your microservices environment. This session will focus on how a myriad of tools, including several CNCF projects, work collectively to deliver the full functionality of Istio.\n\nThis webinar will cover:\n- How Grafana and Prometheus make makes it easy for your entire team to understand whatâ€™s going on with your microservices.\n- How Jaeger can be most effectively used for tracing to get to root cause analysis.\n- How Cortex delivers long-term storage for Prometheus telemetry data, how horizontal scalability and cloud-native storage provides virtually infinite data retention, and how Cortex can solve multi-tenant Prometheus challenges."
