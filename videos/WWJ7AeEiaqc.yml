description: "Sched.net: A Network-Aware Kubernetes Scheduler [I] - Akash Gangil & Salvatore Orlando, VMware\n\nDifferent workloads have different optimal scheduling requirements. For instance, a video streaming microservice would need higher network bandwidth than a microservice running the codec. Kubernetes exposes an interface to build a custom scheduler. In this talk, we will show how better scheduling decisions can be made with information about the network topology. The scheduler would make pod scheduling decisions as a function of network health, in addition to other resources like cpu and memory predicates used by the default scheduler. \n\nThe talk would highlight:\n* How kubernetes empowers the users to build their own custom scheduler and challenges that come along with it.\n* Why we needed sched.net over the current default scheduler? \n* Demonstrate how better scheduling decisions can be made, if the scheduler is also aware of the current network state with a simple demo described below.\n\nDemo setup would consist of kubernetes with OVN as a networking backend using the ovn-kubernetes plugin. It provides a well defined translation between Kubernetes and OVN logical network abstractions. Ex: namespace → logical switch, pod → logical switch port. Sched.net would be implemented by adding a predicate function which would determine “network health” from information gathered from OVN controller.\n\nAbout Akash Gangil\nAkash is currently a Sr. Software Engineer at Uhana. Previously, he was a software engineer at Networking and Security Business Unit at VMware. He worked at enabling VMware NSX as a networking fabric for Kubernetes. He recently graduated from Georgia Tech with a focus on Computer Systems and is passionate about middleware and distributed systems.\n\nAbout Salvatore Orlando\nSalvatore used to be very involved with Openstack Networking. He actually implemented the first version of the Neutron API, then called Quantum. It was so good it had to be re-done from scratch. At some point he decided he made enough damage and left. After spending some time picking colors for painting bike sheds - and shaving yaks - he decided to turn his attention to Kubernetes.\n\nHowever, Salvatore is not only known for his wild commits. He is also famous for his pedant reviews; they're so boring and full of pointless comments that they are being used in a clinical trial for a treatment for insomnia. Salvatore is currently employed at VMware, who joined through Nicira."
