language: English
recordingDate: 1525827650
description: 'Spatially aware devices are enabling applications to freely mix real and virtual worlds, untethered, at the scale of event spaces, factories and warehouses, not just room-scale. In our talk, we will discuss the lessons we have learned while developing applications for the HoloLens. These large-space interactions raise new challenges in UI, input, and associating of holograms to the real world.'
