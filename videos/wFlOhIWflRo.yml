description: "When I was asked to teach Ruby on Rails at Columbia University I observed that a significant number of the skills required to become a successful professional in the industry are acquired on the job and aren't being taught in school. Many of us professionals thrive on open source software and on sharing code, but academia is not always teaching this type of resourcefulness to students.\nThis presentation will cover lessons learned from the experience teaching in my alma mater's CS program, how I developed a hacker-centric curriculum, and how we as hackers can fix this.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG94/"
