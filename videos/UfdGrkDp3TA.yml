description: "Get the latest information about how the law is racing to catch up with technological change from staffers at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the nation’s premiere digital civil liberties group fighting for freedom and privacy in the computer age. This session will include updates on current EFF issues such as surveillance online and fighting efforts to use intellectual property claims to shut down free speech and halt innovation, discussion of our technology project to protect privacy and speech online, updates on cases and legislation affecting security research, and much more.  Half the session will be given over to question-and-answer, so it's your chance to ask EFF questions about the law and technology issues that are important to you.\n\nKurt Opsahl is the Deputy Executive Director and General Counsel of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nNate Cardozo is a Staff Attorney on the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s digital civil liberties team. In addition to his focus on free speech and privacy litigation, Nate works on EFF's Who Has Your Back? report and Coders' Rights Project. \n\nMark Jaycox is a Legislative Analyst for EFF.
