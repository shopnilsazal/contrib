description: "Petr Viktorin - Import Deep Dive\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nWhatever you need to do with Python, you can probably import a library\nfor it. But what exactly happens when you use that import statement?\nHow does a source file that you've installed or written become a\nPython module\nobject, providing functions or classes for you to play with?\n\nWhile the import mechanism is relatively well-documented in the\nreference and dozens of PEPs, sometimes even Python veterans are\ncaught by surprise. And some details are little-known: did you know\nyou can import from zip archives? Write CPython modules in C, or even\na dialect of Lisp? Or import from URLs (which might not be a good\nidea)?\n\nThis talk explains exactly what can happen when you use the import\nstatement â€“ from the mundane machinery of searching PYTHONPATH through\nsubtle details of packages and import loops, to deep internals of\ncustom importers and C extension loading."
