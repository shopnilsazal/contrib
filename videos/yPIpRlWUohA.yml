description: "Many Shades of Scale: Big Learning Beyond Big Data: \nIn the machine learning research community, much of the attention devoted to ‘big data’ in recent years has been manifested as development of new algorithms and systems for distributed training on many examples. This focus has led to significant advances in the field, from basic but operational implementations on popular platforms to highly sophisticated prototypes in the literature. In the meantime, other aspects of scaling up learning have received relatively little attention, although they are often more pressing in practice. The talk will survey these less-studied facets of big learning: scaling to an extremely large number of features, to many components in predictive pipelines, and to multiple data scientists collaborating on shared experiments."
