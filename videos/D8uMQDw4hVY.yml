Learn what rkt has to offer and how you can use it for running your containers.\n\nAbout Iago\nIago brought his relaxed Spanish demeanor to Berlin a few years back. Sincenthen, he’s been diving and swimming around the internals of various Linuxnflavors; Android, embedded and Cloud. Container technologies are his currentnfocus; specifically on the rkt project where he’s a core contributor andnmaintainer. Although he once got distracted by functional programming, hisndaily tasks see him working mainly in Go and C.\n\nAbout Alban\nOriginally from France, Alban currently lives in Berlin where he is a CTO & co-founder at Kinvolk, a software engineering team focused on building foundational Linux technologies for the cloud. He is a contributor to rkt, a container runtime for Linux, Weave Scope, a container visualization & monitoring tool, and is actively working on BPF-related projects. Before falling into containers, Alban worked on various projects core to modern Linux; kernel IPC and storage, dbus performance and security, etc. His current technical interests revolve around networking, security, systemd and containers at the lower-levels of the system. Alban previously gave talks at several conferences including FOSDEM, Linux Plumbers, IO Visor Summit, Kubecon and LinuxCons/OSSummit."
