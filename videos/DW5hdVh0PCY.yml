description: "Tensor Processing and Machine Learning for Signal Processing Functional Algorithm Definition and Concurrent Automation\nby Tim O’Shea\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThis talk will discuss the applicability and potential of tensor processingmethods for signal processing algorithm implementation. It will consider bothmachine learning and non-machine learning signal processing applications anddiscuss how they can be efficiently implemented with TensorFlow and usedquickly in conjunction with GNU Radio.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 16:15:00"
