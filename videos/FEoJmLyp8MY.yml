description: "PyData London 2018\n\nThere is mounting evidence that the widespread deployment of machine learning and artificial intelligence in business and government is likely reproducing or even amplifying existing prejudices and inequalities. Even when an analyst wants to pursue fairness and accuracy, it is easy to unintentionally create discriminatory code. I will discuss how to be good and avoid being part of the problem.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
