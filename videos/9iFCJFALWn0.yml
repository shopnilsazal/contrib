description: "Rethinking the View using React.js by Prathamesh Sonpatki\n\nComplex web interfaces is the need of the hour. The interactions should be smooth, pages should load fast, changes should happen without reloading page that too as fast as possible. Users must feel great while using the app. But with so much complexity, its becoming harder and harder to keep the frontend codebase clear, predictable and reusable. Time to rethink! \n\nIn this talk, I will first give an overview of React.js, a JavaScript library from Facebook for building user interfaces, covering core concepts such as building and composing components, virtual DOM, immutable data structures, one way data flow - which makes React really shine. \n\nAfter that, we will dive straight into an example where I will show how Rails can leverage power of React. Most importantly, audience will understand power of rethinking existing best practices. \n\nLets start (re)thinking!"
