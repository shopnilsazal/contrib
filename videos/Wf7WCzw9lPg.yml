title: 'Building Securable Infrastructure: Open-Source Private Clouds'
recordingDate: 1378230133
description: "Pravir Chandra, CTO Security Architect, Bloomberg\nPresented at the 22nd USENIX Security Symposium\n\nUsing an open-sourced stack from bottom to top, this presentation will discuss the practical challenges alongside the security opportunities of standing up a private cloud infrastructure. Looking beyond the obvious upside of programmatically definable systems, private clouds present a new platform for security controls that are generally unattainable in traditional infrastructure models. Building on this concept, this talk will present a few interesting security ideas that are currently under development and some that could be the subject of future research."
