description: "For the titles Mortal Kombat and Injustice: Gods Among us, NetherRealm Studios created a set of seamless transitions between gameplay and movie files to tell a grand, sweeping story for their fighting game. This 2013 talk from NetherRealm's Adisak Pochanayon covers some of the technical challenges and the implementation process when movies are used in games. The talk covers seamless transitions, custom file IO, minimization of resource contention with simultaneous movie playback and level data loading, pre-caching and off-line metadata extraction for hitch-free playback, jitter window detection, and implementing a movie decoding pipeline.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
