title: '7 Deadly Sins: Unlock the Gates of Mobile Hacking Heaven - Dan Kuykendall'
recordingDate: 1391449971
description: "After spending the past year hacking mobile applications, Dan Kuykendall co-CEO and CTO of NT OBJECTives, searched to uncover the most common security mistakes made during mobile app development.  In this presentation he will share with attendees the findings of his research which center on session management -- the process of authenticating the user and ensuring an attacker isn't impersonating a user or eavesdropping on the service.  In most cases, a vulnerability in any single area isn't a significant liability, however, the more mistakes that are made, the easier it is to attack the app. In this talk Dan will unveil what he calls The Seven Deadly Sins of Mobile Application Development (such as trusting the client and improper use of NONCE) and what developers can do to sin no more! How many are you committing? \n  \n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
