title: 'Integrating Mobile Devices into your Penetration Testing Program - Georgia Weidman - AppSec Ca 2016'
recordingDate: 1458611582
description: "Though still an imperfect science in many ways, penetration testing is often our only way of assessing the effectiveness of our security programs against actual attackers. As mobile devices enter the enterprise en masse, much focus has been on securing them and limiting the risk of BYOD using EMM, MDM, MIM, pick your favorite security control acronym. While many shops are engaging in code review, static analysis, pentesting, etc. against custom mobile applications built in house, even enterprises with mature security programs are often ignoring mobile devices and the surrounding infrastructure in their security testing. It seems like common sense to provide adequate security testing for all devices on corporate networks, particularly when spending large chunks of budget on security controls around BYOD. If we have a DoS protection, we put it in front of staging and hit it with DoS attacks. If it falls down, the control is not providing return on investment. If we have a patch management practice we make sure there are no missing patches leading to compromise during our penetration tests, and if there are, we augment our security program accordingly. We need to be doing the same around mobile. How secure are these devices really against attack? If they are compromised what data on the device is in jeopardy? What other assets in the enterprise are now at risk of attack from the compromised mobile device? By using traditional penetration testing techniques augmented for the unique attack vectors for mobile devices we can assess these risks and get a clear picture of the risk of BYOD in the environment. In this talk we will discuss techniques along with live demonstration scenarios of penetration tests on mobile devices and the surrounding infrastructure. From mobile phishing to undermining security controls to using compromised mobile devices as pivot points, the mobile risk is real and we need to be simulating it in our security testing. We will discuss how these techniques can augment and extend penetration testing and how they can be seamlessly integrated into your existing security program.\n\nGeorgia Weidman\nFounder and CEO, Bulb Security and Shevirah Inc.\nGeorgia Weidman is a penetration tester, security researcher, and trainer.
