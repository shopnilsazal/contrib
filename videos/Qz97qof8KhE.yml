title: 'Nadia Udler | Educational framework for Black Box optimization methods design'
recordingDate: 1477350657
description: "PyData DC 2016\n\nMany pressing real world problems can be stated as problems of global optimization, where target function is a black box. Such problems are best approached with a library of optimization methods to help study the nature of the problem. We show how to use Scipy.optimize and Scikit-learn modules to create global optimization methods with desired properties."
