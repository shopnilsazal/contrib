description: "Modern Cryptography by: John Downey\n\nOnce the realm of shadowy government organizations, cryptography now permeates computing. Unfortunately, it is difficult to get correct and most developers know just enough to be harmful for their projects. Together, weâ€™ll go through the basics of modern cryptography and where things can go horribly wrong.\n\nSpecific topics:\n\nCryptographic primitives\nSecure password storage\nSubtle flaws that can leave you insecure\nWhy you should use TLS/SSL and GPG instead"
