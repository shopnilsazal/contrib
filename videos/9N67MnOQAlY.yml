description: "A different Lua JIT using Eclipse OMR Using the Eclipse OMR JitBuilder to improve Lua performance with minimal changes to the interpreter\nby Charlie Gracie\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nI will be discussing recent work by my team to use the Eclipse OMR JitBuildertechnology to improve the Lua interpreter performance. I will show the smallchanges required in the runtime to take advantage of the OMR JitBuildertechnology, show the performance improvements and discuss the trade offs ofusing a JIT.\n\nThe Eclipse OMR project consists of a highly integrated set of open source Cand C++ components that can be used to build robust language runtimes thatwill support many different hardware and operating system platforms. The talkwill be focused mainly on the Compiler technology and specifically theJitBuilder and how it could be used by the Lua runtime. You can read moreabout the Eclipse OMR project at https://www.eclipse.org/omr/ and view thecode at https://github.com/eclipse/omr. I will make a version of the Luaruntime source code with our changes available so everyone can look throughand ask questions or provide feedback.\n\n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 11:50:00"
