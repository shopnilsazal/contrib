description: "eBay Geo-Distributed Database on Kubernetes [A] - Chengyuan Li & Xinglang Wang, eBay\n\nDatabase as a Service is one of the most interesting and challenging domains on the cloud industry. In eBay, we implemented a cloud-native geo-distributed document service based on the kubernetes. eBay extended the kubernetes to support local disk volume on bare metal machine, which enables the high performance DB can be deployed on the kubernetes as a Pod. On top of the kubernetes platform, we develop a control layer to orchestrate the databased pods and enable it can be distributed on multiple cluster, and expand the WISB model to use a workflow to auto manage the database cluster. \n\nAbout Chengyuan Li\nChengyuan Li is a member in eBay Kubernetes team, his focus area is host-runtime and storage in Kubernetes. Before joining Kubernetes project, he worked in computer and network area for eBay cloud.\n\nAbout Xinglang Wang\nXinglang Wang is a architect in eBay Data platform, he is working on ebay next generation geo-distribute database, and his main focus is the distribution and control layer of the database. Before he is the architect of ebay real-time behaviour data pipeline, focus on real-time stream processing."
