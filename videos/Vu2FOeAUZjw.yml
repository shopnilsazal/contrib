description: "or Making Better Lemonade From Chaos\n\nLife isn't always simple. We often have to deal with a mishmash of applications, languages, and servers. How can we begin to standardize functionality across this chaos? Custom reverse proxies to the rescue! Using Ruby and EventMachine, learn how you can abstract high-level features and functionality into fast reverse proxies that can improve scalability, save time, and make the world happy.\n\nSee how we've applied this across a diverse set of web service APIs to standardize the implementation of authentication, request throttling, analytics, and more. See how this can save development time, eliminate code duplication, make your team happy, make the public happy, and make you a hero. See how this can be applied to any TCP-based application for a wide-variety of use cases. Still think your situation is complicated? Learn about the U.S. Government's plans to standardize API access across the entire federal government. With some reverse proxy magic, this isn't quite as difficult or as foolhardy as it may first sound. It also comes with some nice benefits for both the public audience and government developers.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGed/"
