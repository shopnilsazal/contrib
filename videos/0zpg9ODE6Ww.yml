description: "PyData London 2018\n\nTime-series forecasting is a well-studied research area but commonly used forecasting techniques usually fall short when used in a real-time setting for which computation speed, reactiveness to new patterns, robustness, and reliability are essential. In this talk, we will discuss forecasting methods that achieve those goals and will show how Python tools such as NumPy and Cython can help.\n\nSlides:  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12XnOOodrD36Xr-x59rXy2fS9PLApopIgXJx6Ucx4MSM/edit?usp=sharing\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
