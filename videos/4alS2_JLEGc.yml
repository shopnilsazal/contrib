description: "Copy of the slides for this talk are here:https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Toews-Behrens/DEFCON-20-Toews-Behrens-BBQSQL.pdf\n\nExtras:https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Toews-Behrens/Extras.zip \n\nRapid Blind SQL Injection Exploitation with BBQSQL\nBen Toews Security Consultant, Neohapsis\nScott Behrens Security Consultant, Neohapsis\n\nBlind SQL injection can be a pain to exploit. When the available tools work they work well, but when they don't you have to write something custom. This is time-consuming and tedious. This talk will be introducing a new tool called BBQSQL that attempts to address these concerns. This talk will start with a brief discussion of SQL Injection and Blind SQL Injection. It will then segue into a discussion of how BBQSQL can be useful in exploiting these vulnerabilities. This talk will cover how features like evented concurrency and character frequency based searching can greatly improve the performance of a SQL Injection tool. This talk should leave you with enough knowledge to begin using BBQSQL to simplify and speed up your application pentests.\n\nBen Toews is a Security Consultant at Neohapsis where he specializes in application and network pentesting. Previously, Ben has worked as a sysadmin and as a developer. Ben has spoken at Thotcon 0x03 and has been published in HITB Magazine. Ben has a BS in Information Assurance and Security Engineering from DePaul University.\nTwitter: @mastahyeti\nhttp://btoe.ws\n\nScott Behrens is currently employed as a Security Consultant at Neohapsis and an Adjunct Professor at DePaul University.
