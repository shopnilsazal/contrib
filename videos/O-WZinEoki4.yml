title: '#HITB2012KUL D1T2 - Mark Dowd & Tarjei Mandt - iOS 6 Security'
recordingDate: 1354003366
description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/materials/ \n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT: \n\nIn recent years, iOS security has become a hot topic, largely due to the unprecedented popularity of Apple iDevices. One of the major exploitation targets within iOS that has received a significant amount of public scrutiny is the kernel, as it encapsulates the security extensions that govern access to the device. A variety of kernel exploits have been publicly released that employ relatively simple attack methodologies, largely due to the fact that very few kernel-level exploit mitigation technologies have been put in place. Apple has addressed this problem in iOS 6 with the addition of a variety of kernel hardening technologies that are intended to thwart popular exploitation strategies that are typically used by attackers.\n\nThis presentation introduces these technologies, discusses their impact and effectiveness against popular attack methodologies, and also outline their limitations (where appropriate). It is hoped that attendees will gain an understanding of the current state of iOS kernel exploitation, what techniques have been rendered useless, and the kinds of techniques that will need to be employed in future kernel-level exploits.\n\nABOUT MARK DOWD\n\nMark is a director and founder of Azimuth Security, and brings over 10 years of security experience to the team. The bulk of his professional career has been focused in the area of application security research. Mark spent a number of years as a senior researcher at IBM's Internet Security Systems (ISS) X-Force, during which he discovered a number of high-profile vulnerabilities in ubiquitous Internet software. In addition to professional vulnerability research, Mark's previous experience includes serving as a principal security architect for McAfee, as well as performing a variety of information security consulting services independently and for ITAC Consulting.\n\nMark's vulnerability research record speaks for itself. Over the last decade, Mark has identified and helped remediate critical remotely exploitable security vulnerabilities in Sendmail, Microsoft Exchange, OpenSSH, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Adobe Flash, Checkpoint VPN, and Microsoft's SSL implementation. In addition to his vulnerability research, Mark has published several technical research papers, and was a co-author of the Addison-Wesley Professional book \"The Art of Software Security Assessment\". He was the winner of the 2009 Google Native Client Security Contest. Mark regularly speaks at industry conferences, including BlackHat, CanSecWest, PacSec, and Ruxcon.\n\nCO-PRESENTER: TARJEI MANDT \n\nTarjei Mandt is a senior vulnerability researcher at Azimuth Security. He holds a Master's degree in Information Security and has previously spoken at security conferences such as Black Hat USA, INFILTRATE, SyScan, H2HC, and Hackito Ergo Sum. In his free time, he enjoys spending countless hours challenging security mechanisms and researching intricate issues in low-level system components. Recently, he has done extensive research on modern kernel pool exploitation and discovered several vulnerabilities in Windows kernel components."
