Iterators in JavaScript are what the for ... of loop uses when iterating over an Array, but the for ... of loop can actually iterate over anything, built in JavaScript objects like Strings, Maps, Set or your own custom JavaScript objects, as long as those objects provide an Iterator.\n\nQuokka is this great little plugin that provides inline evaluation of your JavaScript. You've seen me use Quokka a lot in Fun Fun Function videos to showcase JavaScript code, just because I think it's a great tool, but this episode is actually graciously sponsored by Quokka, so as thanks for supporting the show, I'm going to show it off a little extra.
