recordingDate: 1391474419
description: "Zed A. Shaw: Saving The Internet With Hate\n\nUtu is the Maori word for a system of revenge used by Maori society to provide social controls and retribution. Utu is also a protocol that uses cryptographic models of social interaction to allow peers to vote on their dislike of other peer's behavior. The goal of Utu is to experiment with the effects of bringing identity, reputation, and retribution to human communications on the Internet. A secondary goal is wiping out IRC because apparently nobody really likes IRC. \n\nThis presentation will cover the protocol's design, use of cryptography, secure coding practices, and an analysis of it's adoption and current research results. The presentation is for medium to advanced  participants interested in similar open source projects. In the spirit of openness and collaboration and just plain evil, there will be an Utu server running for conference participants to use during the conference. The goal is to present the system, get people thinking,  and obtain feedback on the design and implementation.\"Zed A. Shaw is the author of a Ruby web server named Mongrel and a frequent speaker at conferences and user groups around the US. He's currently working as a software developer and tinkers on open source projects in his spare time."
