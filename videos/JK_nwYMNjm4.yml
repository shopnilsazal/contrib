description: 'Hacking GPUs for Deep Learning: GPUs have revolutionized machine learning in recent years, and have made both massive and deep multi-layer neural networks feasible. However, misunderstandings on why they seem to be winning persist. Many of deep learning’s workloads are in fact “too small” for GPUs, and require significantly different approaches to take full advantage of their power. There are many differences between traditional high-performance computing workloads, long the domain of GPUs, and those used in deep learning. This talk will cover these issues by looking into various quirks of GPUs, how they are exploited (or not) in current model architectures, and how Facebook AI Research is approaching deep learning programming through our recent work.'
