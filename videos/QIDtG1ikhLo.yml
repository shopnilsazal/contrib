description: "Lightning Talk: Values from Puzzles, Math, and Code by Joy Paas\n\nThis talk is about how my experiences from childhood doing puzzles and Maths help me as a professional developer. As a child, I loved puzzles. I used to hate Math and coding before but looking back at my childhood, I remembered how fun it is to solve problems and always remind myself about it."
