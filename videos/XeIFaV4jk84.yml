description: "Ostap Chervak\nSoftware Engineer @ Stikersoft\nHow to build large web apps and sleep at night \n\nWhen building large apps you always have to deal with managing your domain entities. You always have to make decisions regarding routing and CRUD operations on data. There are always a lot more questions bigger than \"todo list\" and \"counters\" examples could answer. You need some patterns that let you build apps that are due yesterday. What if I told you that there is a solution for that? Using react, mobx, mobx-react, mobx-utils and serializr can speed up you development drastically. Think of business logic instead of solving trivial tasks for the n:th time! \n\nJoin us on meetup.com: https://www.meetup.com/Kyiv-ReactJS-M...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/reactkyiv\nTelegram chat: https://telegram.me/reactkyiv"
