description: "Classification Labels in a Fast Moving Environment: Classification problems are very common in ecommerce. Collecting and storing labels from different sources is key to train and evaluate such models.\n\nLabels are expensive to obtain, thus selecting which products to get labels for is key to optimally use any available labeling budget, both when training and evaluating a model. At the same time, if available labels are not correctly used, incorrect or suboptimal results can be produced.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss some of the challenges and potential pitfalls of acquiring and using labels for classification in a quickly evolving environment. I will present a system that store labels, provides a way to select labels to optimize budget while providing accurate and unbias evaluations of the classification models."
