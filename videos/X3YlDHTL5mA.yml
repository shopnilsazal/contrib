title: '#HITBGSEC 2016 SG Conference Track D2 - Fuzzing The Windows Kernel - Koh Yong Chuan'
recordingDate: 1475226281
description: "As applications sandboxing matures to become the industry standard as part of its defense-in-depth strategy, software vendors are now more adept in strengthening their sandboxes after iterations of design reviews, code reviews, fuzzing and patches. However there is still a large attack surface that attackers can target to escape sandboxes; the Windows kernel.\n\nThis talk will present an architecture for fuzzing the Windows kernel and its components from test-case generation to crash collection. We will also discuss how this may be designed for a distributed fuzzing architecture that scales up effectively.\n\n===\n\nYong Chuan is a security researcher for MWR Labs. He is currently interested in sandbox security, and has previously talked about the Microsoft Office Protected-view sandbox."
