description: "Winn Schwartau - HERF Guns, EMP Bombs and Weapons of Mass Disruption (UnClassified)\nAt DefCon III, Winn Schwartau talked about High Energy Radio Frequency Guns, Electromagnetic Pulse Bombs and assorted nefarious weapons. Trouble is, the government doesn't admit to a thing. However, through constant research, he has found more than the government would like.\n\nThe August issue of Popular Science, due out on or about July 15 will feature Schwartau's article on these emerging devices -- but you will get an early peek at DefCon 7 on Saturday afternoon. Russian HERF and EMP devices for sale world wide. Some are even on the Internet! Terrorist level weapons made in a garage for less than $500 and put out an E field in excess of 1MV/meter. A video of real HERF at work. Be ready with your questions and Schwartau, as usual, will have answers. \n\nDEF CON 7.0 was held July 9-11th, 1999, in Las Vegas Nevada USA"
