description: "Matthew G. Marsh - Replacing TripWire with SNMPv3\nThis talk demonstrates how to use SNMPv3 software (specifically illustrated using Net-SNMP) both with minor custom configurations and also with specialized MIBs and Agents to provide file data and file hashes on demand over secure channels. I also discuss the use of the TCP Inform Trap as a syslog style message transfer mechanism. I spend the majority of the time showing how the authentication and privacy features of SNMPv3 provide robust bi-directional security message transfers. Along the way I demonstrate how to use the split between the authentication and privacy features to provide double blind random file hashes of a managed system. Use of trigger settings to capture file changes will be discussed. I provide the example MIBs and related Agent code for general Unix platforms running Net-SNMP and where possible discuss how to get the code working on Microsoft or other platforms. Time permitting I will digress into ways to integrate these techniques into common Network Management platforms.\n\nChief Scientist of the NEbraskaCERT, President & Founder of Paktronix Systems LLC, Author of \"Policy Routing Using Linux\" (SAMS), Creator of PakSecured Linux.
