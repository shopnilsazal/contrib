description: "I know this is out of left field, but I'd like to teach you all some Angular, and in the process, bring you to a love of Ember Components unseen since Leo sank into his watery grave for Kate. We all make fun of directives and transclusion, but Ember has very equivalent features, which much more elegant APIs. Once we have a basic understanding of what directives and components bring to the table, I'll explain why Ember Components are awesome, unbelievably useful, and unparalleled in expressiveness.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG3A/"
