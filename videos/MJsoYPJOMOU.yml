description: "By, Miles Forrest\nDo you love Ruby? Do you like geeking out with other Ruby coders? Do you have a project you would love to build but might need some help making it happen?\n\nThe Seattle Ruby Brigade is arguably the most successful Ruby User Group in the world. They were not only the first Ruby group in the world, but have also shipped and support hundreds of open source projects, and they still meeting every single week for over 12 years. How do they do it? Why do so many User Groups languish and die while Seattle.rb thrives?\n\nMiles Forrest tried to start a Ruby user group three times, but each attempt failed miserably. Here's the full story of how he cloned the Seattle Ruby Brigade back in 2009 and built his own club out in a rural area, which is also still going strong after 5 years.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGYN/"
