description: "PyData New York City 2017\n\nSlides: https://github.com/ChayaSt/pydatanyc_cc\n\nMost drug discovery projects have a 95% failure rate. In this talk I will show how I used Pymc, a Python probabilistic programming language, to improve molecular models used in the early stages of drug discovery to eliminate unlikely drug candidates. In addition, I will discuss how I propagated model error using reweighing techniques."
