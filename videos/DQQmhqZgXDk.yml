description: "What started with two brothers in the McKinney Public Library is now a world wide word phenomenon on multiple mobile platforms. We'll look at how we have grown, the mistakes we made, and the changes we have made along the way:\n\nServing millions of players a day: Stats, stats, stats!\nWorking with constraints: * 1 service, 6 games (and counting) * Native clients means backward compatibility, ftw!\nHow do I know what to fix? Instrumenting and reporting on everything\nWhere is the data? Using the database, memcache, Redis to the fullest\nWhat we did wrong? What we did right? What would we do differently?\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGd5/"
