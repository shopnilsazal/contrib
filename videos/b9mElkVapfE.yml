description: "Matineh Shaker is an Artificial Intelligence Scientist at Bonsai in Berkeley, CA, where she builds machine learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning tools and algorithms for general purpose intelligent systems. She was previously a Machine Learning Researcher at Geometric Intelligence, Data Science Fellow at Insight Data Science, Predoctoral Fellow at Harvard Medical School. She received her PhD from Northeastern University with a dissertation in geometry-inspired manifold learning.\n\nAbstract Summary:\n\nDeep Reinforcement Learning with Shallow Trees:\nIn this talk, I present Concept Network Reinforcement Learning (CNRL), developed at Bonsai. It is an industrially applicable approach to solving complex tasks using reinforcement learning, which facilitates problem decomposition, allows component reuse, and simplifies reward functions. Inspired by Sutton’s options framework, we introduce the notion of “Concept Networks” which are tree-like structures in which leaves are “sub-concepts” (sub-tasks), representing policies on a subset of state space. The parent (non-leaf) nodes are “Selectors”, containing policies on which sub-concept to choose from the child nodes, at each time during an episode. There will be a high-level overview on the reinforcement learning fundamentals at the beginning of the talk.\n\nSee Matineh's slides here: https://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/matineh-shaker-artificial-intelligence-scientist-bonsai-at-mlconf-sf-2017-81993063"
