description: "From 0 to 6 GHz in 30 minutes: Bootstrapping your SDR experience Start from scratch today, hack the EM spectrum tomorrow!\nby Marcus Müller\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThere's no reason SDR needs to be limited to an elite group of users. Thereare so many tools out there that allow anyone with some technical backgroundto quickly get familiar with the world of SDR. Depending on your background(Ham radio operator, software developer, wireless researcher, Michelin starchef) you may already know some parts of the big picture, but might be missingothers. The last few years, many tools have been created to ease your entryinto SDR, and we will give an overview of what they are and how you canquickly get started working with electromagnetic waves. No prior knowledgerequired!\n\nAssuming you can operate a Linux computer, we will use the following tools toget you started with SDR and GNU Radio: \\- PyBOMBS \\- GNU Radio Companion \\-gr_modtool\n\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 11:00:00"
