description: "Physical access trumps digital access and we’ve all seen lockpicking explained at several security venues. You might even have tried it yourself. But what if you need to open a lock a number of times? Wouldn’t it be great to have an opening technique that would supply you with a working key in the process?\n\nA method to do this has existed for quite some time, but until recently it has remained quite unknown. Some time ago impressioning locks got “re-invented” by the lockpick community and the skill evolved to the level now shown at several international championships.\n\nUnlike lockpicking, impressioning creates a fully working key for the lock which can be used to lock and unlock the cylinder at will. With practice, this technique can consistently open a lock in 10-15 minutes (and potentially faster)!\n\nWhat is it? How does it work? What skill is involved? Why is it the most interesting way to open a lock? These questions, and more will be answered in this talk. With this technique (and a bit of training) several of your defence layers might turn out to be not as effective as you previously thought…\n\n=== \n\nJos Weyers (@josweyers) is a world-record holder in the field of lock impressioning and a mainstay participant at LockSport events around the world. A long-time member of TOOOL in the Netherlands and a key figure at the Hack42 hackerspace in Arnhem, Jos recently became the Vice-President of TOOOL.nl and now helps to oversee that organization and the LockCon conference. Jos is the mastermind behind the beehive42.org initiative. Some people know him as the Dutch Kilt guy. Featured in the New York Times. Voted #2 in the category “Hackers and Security” of the Nerd101-list of VrijNederland June 2015."
