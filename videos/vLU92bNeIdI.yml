With such limited resources online about attacking these protectors, what is a new reverse engineer to do? Have no fear, after drinking all the cheap wine two Android hackers have attacked all the protectors currently available for everyones enjoyment! Whether you've never reversed Android before or are a hardened veteran there will be something for you, along with all the glorious PoC tools and plugins for your little heart could ever desire.\n\nTim \"diff\" Strazzere is a Lead Research and Response Engineer at Lookout Mobile Security. Along with writing security software, he specializes in reverse engineering and malware analysis. Some interesting past projects include having reversing the Android Market protocol, Dalvik decompilers and memory manipulation on mobile devices. Past speaking engagements have included DEFCON, BlackHat, SyScan, HiTCON and EICAR.\n\nJon \"Justin Case\" Sawyer - 31 yr old father of four, and CTO of Applied Cybersecurity LLC. Jon likes to spend his nights with a fine (cheap) glass of wine, writing exploits for the latest Android devices. When not researching vulnerabilities or writing exploits, he dabbles in dalvik obfuscation."
