description: "Type systems will make you a better JavaScript developer\n\nFlow and TypeScript promise “types in js” - but what does that get you, exactly? What’s the experience of adding types to a large project? Is the overhead worth it for you and your team? In the end, type systems will give you more confidence in your code, fewer bugs, and a much friendlier codebase.\n\nJared Forsyth\nI interned on the React Native team, I rewrote the React devtools, and I’ve given several talks on React & related technologies. I work at Khan Academy on the mobile team, where I work in Swift, ObjC, Java, and Javascript. \n\nI love type systems and learning new languages, and I’m deeply invested in improving the experience of programming for everyone."
