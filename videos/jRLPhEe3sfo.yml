The goal of the nonpartisan Commission is to develop recommendations for a comprehensive strategy to improve cyber security in federal systems and in critical infrastructure. Hear what is going on with this Commission, ask questions, and provide input on what you think should be addressed at a Presidential level for the next administration.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
