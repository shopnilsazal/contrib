description: "\"Improve your developer's toolset\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - PythonAnywhere Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nFor Python development, we mainly focus on IDE, browser and sometimes a command line. I want to focus on command line tools which seem to be a bit forgotten these days. Let me show a few tools I'm using on daily basis and how they helped me become more productive. I'll prove it's possible to start up a new environment from scratch that feels like $HOME. Finally, I want to convince you how important it is to constantly challenge yourself and your tools, how useful is a custom toolbox tailored to you.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
