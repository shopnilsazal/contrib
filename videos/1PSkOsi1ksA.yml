description: 'APIs have been with us for 65 years or so. They come in all shapes, sizes, and disguises. In this talk we''ll discuss the fascinating history of APIs and look at a few of them, focusing on what makes them good, what makes them successful, and why the correlation between quality and success isn''t as high we might want it to be. We''ll conclude with a brief discussion of the legal status of APIs, and what it means to us as software professionals.'
