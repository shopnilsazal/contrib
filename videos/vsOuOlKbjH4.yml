Plus, adventures in not getting arrested on the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nSpeaker Bios: \nDarren Kitchen is the founder of Hak5, an Internet television show inspiring hackers and IT pros since 2005. Breaking out of the 1990s phone phreak scene, Darren has continued to foster his passion for information security throughout his career as a systems administrator, presenter and now creator of nefarious penetration testing tools.
