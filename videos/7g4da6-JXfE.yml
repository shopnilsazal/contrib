description: "Keynote: Kubernetes: As Seen On TV - Erik St. Martin, Systems Architect, Comcast\n\n\"Kubernetes is not just a product to be used solely as it comes out of the box, itâ€™s also a platform, a series of building blocks that can be tweaked, tuned, and modified to fit more specific use cases.\n\nAt Comcast we are building a geographically distributed system to stream linear video to millions of cable customers around the country, from nearly 1,000 physical locations, within 27 regional networks. We have unique requirements and constraints which have benefited incredibly from the versatility of Kubernetes. In this talk Erik will walk you through how Comcast leveraged existing Kubernetes components as well as developed custom components to build this system and how you can too.\"\n\nAbout Erik St. Martin\nErik St. Martin is a Systems Architect at Comcast where he works on distributed systems and fail-over strategies for linear video streaming. He's a long time Go developer, Kubernetes user, and the initial author of skydns. In his off time he is an author, podcaster, and organizer of GopherCon."
