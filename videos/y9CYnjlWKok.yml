description: "How many replicas do I need to serve my app? How big my cluster should be? How to make sure that the bill for compute resources is minimal while still be ready to serve all the traffic that can come?\n\nThis kind of questions bother most of the application owners or cluster administrators. This demo session will show how to forget about such problems. We will do a deep dive into the mysterious of autoscaling in kubernetes and show how it can simplify life of kubernetes users."
