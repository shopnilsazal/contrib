description: "As your codebase grows, you will have instances where you have code that needs to be reused. Then you think, I can do this with subclassing! Now you have a diamond-tree of problems.\r\n\r\nHere, we’ll talk about a better way of code reuse and introducing alternate behaviour into existing classes — composition. It’ll improve how you test your code — making your test runs faster, making it easier to test exceptional cases, and making everything easier to understand.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nJuly 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
