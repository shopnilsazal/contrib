description: "Feedback is a valuable resource, yet often times the true value of feedback is hidden underneath its surface. Listening to feedback directly may compromise the goal and vision of the game, but that doesn't mean it should be ignored. In this 2014 talk from Andy Nguyen, get a deeper look at player feedback during various points of Monaco's development to see how all feedback, both good and bad, helped shape Monaco without sacrificing its core design.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
