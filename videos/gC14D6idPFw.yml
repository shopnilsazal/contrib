title: 'SREcon17 Asia/Australia: Operationalizing DevOps Teaching'
language: English
recordingDate: 1497561670
description: "John Contad and Matt Witherow, REA Group\n\nWe started with a premise: if we provided knowledge to developers on how to operationalize services, then they would do it.\n\nIn this talk, I'll talk about the many ways that REA Group has experimented with teaching. From broadcast 50-person classes (Think: SNS), to one-to-one scheduled mentorship roles (Cronjobs), to pull-down models (SQS) - we explore why teaching and mentorship is important to the future of the web, and how formative it is an experience to the mentors.\n\nThese experiments have now formed an internal curriculum - but also an open-source model on teaching DevOps fundamentals to women who want to explore the space (See: DevOps Girls Melbourne)\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
