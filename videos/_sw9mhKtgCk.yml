description: "By Kerri Miller\nIt's your first day at Hogwarts.com, and everything is wonderful and thrilling. You dig in to classes, and soon find a dusty book with a cryptic warning:\n\n\"Do NOT on any circumstances make ANY change to this magic incantation without talking to Doug first!!!\"\nSound familiar? Approaching a legacy code base can feel like unraveling a mystery, not just about the code, but about the personalities who wrote it. What tools and techniques can help you solve the maze of twisty code?
