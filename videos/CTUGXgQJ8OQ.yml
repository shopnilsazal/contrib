description: "Every site on the web should be HTTPS-enabled, but setting up HTTPS can be harder than we'd like: it's easy to misconfigure, and even when a site is HTTPS-enabled, it might not be working as effectively as it could be. In this talk, I'll explain the work that Chrome and other browser teams are doing to make high-quality HTTPS more widespread: developer tools to help debug problems, reporting mechanisms to roll out strong HTTPS safely, and more.\n\nEmily Stark\nSoftware Engineer, Google\nEmily is a software engineer on the Google Chrome security team, where she focuses on efforts to make TLS/SSL more usable and secure. Previously, she was a core developer at Meteor Development Group, where she worked on web framework security and internal infrastructure, and a graduate student researching client-side cryptography in web browsers.\nEmily has a master's degree from MIT and a bachelor's degree from Stanford, both in computer science.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
