description: "by Daniel Stenberg\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nA look at how HTTP/2 has improved the web, which cases that are stillproblematic and what's being done about it next. Will there be a QUIC fix?\n\nA recap on what HTTP/2 brought that HTTP/1 couldn't offer before we dig in andlook at some numbers that show how HTTP/2 has improved (browser) networkingand the web experience for people.\n\nStill, there are scenarios where HTTP/1's multiple connections win over HTTP/2in performance tests. Why is that and what is being done about it? Wasn'tHTTP/2 supposed to be the silver bullet?\n\nA closer look at QUIC, its promises to fix the areas where HTTP/2 didn'tdeliver and a check on where it is today. Is QUIC perhaps actually HTTP/3 ineverything but the name?\n\nDepending on what exactly happens in this area over time until FOSDEM, I willspice it up with more details on how we work on these protocol things inMozilla/Firefox!\n\n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 15:30:00"
