description: 'Since I''ve been working on distributed systems I always wanted to go back in time and teach myself what I know now, in order to avoid the silly mistakes I did! Things like vector clocks, the CAP theorem, how replication really works (and why it''s needed), what BASE means and in general all about how this stuff really works! This is the speech I''d needed when wrote my first distributed system and it''s something you need to know if you fancy working in this area. And we will also be coding some very simple examples in NodeJS, with working demos where we will kill processes and freeze networks! It''s so easy to understand when you see things in action, we will use powerpoint only for some introductory theory! Yep, I am not a big believer of diagrams... show me code!'
