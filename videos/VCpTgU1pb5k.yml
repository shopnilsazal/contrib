In this talk we will\ndescribe poliastro, a pure Python library we can use to compute\norbital maneuvers, plot trajectories and much more. The role of JIT\ncompiling (using numba) to drop the previously used FORTRAN algorithms\nwill also be discussed, as well as the importance of open source in\nscientific discoveries.\n\n-----\n\nIn the intersection of mechanics, mathematics and \"cool stuff that\ntravels through space\" lies Astrodynamics, a beautiful branch of\nphysics that studies the motion of spacecraft. Rocket launches have\nnever been so popular thanks to companies like Space X, more and more\ninvestors pay attention to aerospace startups and amazing missions\nexplore our planet and our Solar System every day.
