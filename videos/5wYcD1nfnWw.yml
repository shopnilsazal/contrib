description: "RailsConf 2017: What Comes After SOLID? Seeking Holistic Software Quality by Ariel Caplan\n\nYou care deeply about code quality and constantly strive to learn more. You devour books and blogs, watch conference talks, and practice code katas.\n\nThat's excellent! But immaculately factored code and clean architecture alone won't guarantee quality software.\n\nAs a developer, your job isn't to write Good Code. It's to deliver value for people. In that light, we'll examine the effects of a host of popular coding practices. What do they accomplish? Where do they fall short?\n\nWe'll set meaningful goals for well-rounded, high-quality software that solves important problems for real people."
