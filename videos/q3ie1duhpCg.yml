While, yes, we all would prefer that these people stick around and join the community, there's no denying that a good drive-thru contribution adds value to your project. \r\n\r\nA strong argument can be made that the more drive-thru contributors your project has, the healthier the project process and ecosystem. It shows that you've set up a process which is easy to understand, easy to follow, and which makes it easy to contribute. In a situation like that, it increases the opportunities for new contributors to become new community members and everyone is a winner.\r\n\r\nThis talk will present:\r\n\r\n* Methods for maximizing drive-thru contributions\r\n* Overall advantages of those methods for your project\r\n* An argument for using number of drive-thru contributions as a metric for project health"
