description: "Everyone loves cloud-AV. Why not harness the wisdom of clouds to protect the enterprise? Consider a high-security enterprise with strict egress filtering - endpoints have no direct Internet connection, or the endpoints' connection to the Internet is restricted to hosts used by their legitimately installed software. Let's say there's malware running on an endpoint with full privileges. The malware still can't exfiltrate data due to the strict egress filtering.\n\nNow let'also assume that this enterprise uses cloud-enhanced anti-virus (AV).You'd argue that if malware is already running on the endpoint with full privileges, then an AV agent can't degrade the security of the endpoint. And you'd be completely wrong.\n\nIn this presentation, we describe and demonstrate a novel technique for exfiltrating data from highly secure enterprises which employ strict egress filtering. Assuming the endpoint has a cloud-enhanced antivirus installed, we show that if the AV employs an Internet-connected sandbox in its cloud, it in fact facilitates such exfiltration. We release a tool implementing the exfiltration technique, and provide real-world results from several prominent AV products. We also provide insights on AV in-the-cloud sandboxes. Finally we address the issues of how to further enhance the attack, and possible mitigations."
