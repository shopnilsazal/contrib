description: "OSFeels 2016 - Unpopular Tech and Why It Was AMAZING by Rebecca Turner\n\nTurn the narrative about \"crufty old legacy technology\" on its head! From CGI scripts, to PHP, from TCL to MySQL, explore why these technologies were exciting and what led to their success. Programming as a profession is forward looking and this sometimes leads us to forget how much influence they've had on what we do today.\n\nThis talk will be half history lesson, half cheer leading now unpopular technologies.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/UkSt/"
