title: 'Blueprint: configuration management for busy people  (Richard Crowley)'
recordingDate: 1319583008
description: 'Configuration management shouldn''t be a luxury. It should be a right available to teams of every size and skill because it makes you confident when you deploy and calm when you scale up. Until now, however, the tools have been focused on the exotic possibilities seen at enormous scale in sprawling organizations. Blueprint is different. Blueprint reverse engineers servers to understand how they''re configured and makes it painless to push the configuration to your coworkers and to production. It understands system packages, gems, config files, source installations, and more. In this talk we''ll discuss the architecture of the Blueprint tools, their use and how they fit into most workflows, their limitations and how users address them, and some of the tools being built on top of Blueprint to manage many servers at once.'
