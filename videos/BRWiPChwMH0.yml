description: "Podcasting While Black Saved My Sanity, It Can Save Yours Too\n\nTech entertainment spaces have been predominantly white for as long as we can remember. Videogame websites, tech shows and podcasts have been the home of homogenous voices and skin tones for the past twenty years. In this talk I want to share how we decided to disrupt things in the gaming sphere by spotlighting the work of people of color in the industry. Using our voices not only to talk about what we love but to also use it make a difference through our social justice platform called #Spawn4Good. Being unapologetically Black has never felt better.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HG6P/"
