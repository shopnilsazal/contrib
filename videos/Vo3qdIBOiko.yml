It will also make you laugh — at least a little. You'll also learn some game theory, some mind games, and finally, how to build a world champion bot in the universe of Rock Paper Scissors.\n\nThis talk is aimed at all levels of Ruby programmers - beginner or advanced. All the examples in the talk and are explained step by step, and many of them relatively basic."
