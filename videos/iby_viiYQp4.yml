recordingDate: 1475226094
description: "Over 30 years ago, when the movie WarGames was released, the only thing the US Government seemed to want to do with hackers was lock them up and throw away the key. But our power to transform the world, both positively and negatively, could not be contained. Today, the Department of Defense has successfully completed the first ever bug bounty program in the US government, paying hackers money to Hack the Pentagon.\n\nWe as hackers specialize in understanding how things work, and transforming the theoretical into the practical to exploit systems and make them do things they might not have been designed to do.\n\nThis talk is about how I hacked the Pentagon, from the Bounty Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and a hacker like you, who once rode the dunes of penetration testing for a living, and now hacks policies. I’ll offer you the Water of Life to pass along my genetic memories to those of you who can bear it. Hackers can learn how to transform dynastic organizations like Microsoft and the DoD from the harsh desert into places where The Spice of bugs flows for cash rewards.\n\nFrom treating hackers like criminals to inviting them to hack the biggest software companies in the world and even the US government, this session will show how philosophic and practical challenges were overcome, and what to expect in the future of bug bounties in governments and private industries.\n\nIn modern security, bug bounties aren’t just for technology companies anymore. It’s finally time to Hack the Planet!\n\n===\n\nKatie Moussouris is the Founder and CEO of a new company, Luta Security ( lutasecurity.com ), named for the tropical island where her mother was born in the US Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a beautiful place that is still home to many members of Katie’s family. Not only is Luta Security the only company offering gap analysis and guidance on ISO 29147 Vulnerability disclosure, and how to implement a vulnerability coordination program (which may or may not include bug bounties), we are also a 100% female-owned and Native Pacific Islander-owned tech company. Luta Security advises companies, lawmakers, & governments on the benefits of hacking & security research to help make the internet safer for everyone. Katie is a hacker – first hacking computers, now hacking policy & regulations.\n\nKatie’s most recent work was in helping the US Department of Defense start the government’s first bug bounty program, called “Hack the Pentagon.” Her earlier Microsoft work encompassed industry-leading initiatives such as Microsoft’s bug bounty programs & Microsoft Vulnerability Research. Katie is also an invited technical expert selected to assist directly in the US Wassenaar negotiations on the inclusion of intrusion software and intrusion software technology, helping to renegotiate broad wording to minimize unintended consequences to the defense of the Internet. She is also a subject matter expert for the US National Body of the International Standards Organization (ISO) in vuln disclosure (29147), vuln handling processes (30111), and secure development (27034). Katie is a visiting scholar with MIT Sloan School, doing research on the vulnerability economy and exploit market.\n\nShe is a New America Foundation Fellow and Harvard Belfer Affiliate. Katie is on the CFP review board for RSA, O’Reilly Security Conference, Shakacon, and is an advisor to the Center for Democracy and Technology"
