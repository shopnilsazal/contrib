description: "Integrating Long-Term Storage with Prometheus [A] - Julius Volz, Prometheus\n\nWhile Prometheus's built-in storage does not support long-term data retention and durability, Prometheus provides nascent interfaces for integration with external long-term storage systems. This talk explains how these interfaces work, and how you can integrate with them to create custom long-term storage solutions. It will also showcase some real-world integration examples and highlight the key challenges in implementing them.\n\nAbout Julius Volz\nJulius co-founded Prometheus and lead the project to success at SoundCloud and beyond. He now focuses on growing the Prometheus community and is the main organizer of PromCon, the first conference around Prometheus. In a previous life, Julius was a Site Reliability Engineer at Google."
