description: "Paul Clip - Hacking from the Palm of your Hand\nHacking from the Palm of your Hand\n\nPalm handhelds have become almost ubiquitous and very cheap, every month sees the announcement of yet another flavor with new and improved functions. Yet, how effective are Palms as a hacking platform?\n\nThis presentation will cover some of the existing security tools on PalmOS before focusing on the release of a new TCP-based scanner running on PalmOS capable of net recon, banner grabbing, and web vulnerability scanning. Design criteria and implementation details will be discussed, as well as a demonstration of the tool in action. The scanner will be available for download at DEFCON.\n\nPaul Clip is a Managing Security Architect with @stake, one of the largest independent security consulting firms, where he focuses on application security. In prior lives, he has architected and secured complex web applications, researched collective intelligence, and coded demos on his Amiga 2000. When not helping clients by breaking and securing their applications, Paul likes geeking around with technology and has been doing just that on his various Palm devices for over five years. He thinks it's about time he released a tool for PalmOS :-)"
