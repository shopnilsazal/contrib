title: 'Eduardo Peire - Using Machine Learning in Python to diagnose Malaria'
language: English
recordingDate: 1508595334
description: "Malaria is a worldwide disease killing between 500.000 and 800.00 people every year. It affects lots of countries and spreads quickly.\n\nUntil now, malaria is diagnosed either with paper stripes or, the most common and accurate method, visual inspection through a microscope. But there are new technologies to solve this problem, such as Computer Vision and machine learning.\n\nAbout the Speaker:  Eduardo Peire is an engineer from Barcelona who developed a device under 50â‚¬, he will explain how it's device is able to diagnose malaria from a blood drop with Convolutional Neural Networks using Keras on the top of Tensorflow. \n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
