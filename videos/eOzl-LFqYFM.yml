description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nCompliant Data Management and Machine Learning on Kubernetes - Daniel Whitenack, Pachyderm (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nData scientists, machine learning engineers, and researchers are under increasing pressure to provide explanations for how they are processing and managing user data. In particular, the EU's GDPR regulations taking effect this year are forcing organizations to rethink their data management and processing strategies. In this talk, we will demonstrate a data management and processing methodology/framework that is helping organization deploy compliant workflows on top of Kubernetes. The framework, based on the open source Pachyderm project, gives data scientists automatic tracking of changes to data and of all the various pieces of data and processing that lead to particular results. This, along with access control strategies and anonymization (which will also be discussed in the talk), gives organizations a framework that is easy to manage, scalable for AI/ML workflows, and compliant.\n\nAbout Daniel\nDaniel Whitenack (@dwhitena) is a Ph.D. trained data scientist working with Pachyderm (@pachydermIO). Daniel develops innovative, distributed data pipelines which include predictive models, data visualizations, statistical analyses, and more. He has spoken at conferences around the world (GopherCon, JuliaCon, PyCon, All Things Open, Spark Summit, and more), teaches data science/engineering at Purdue University (@LifeAtPurdue) and with Ardan Labs (@ardanlabs), maintains the Go kernel for Jupyter, and is actively helping to organize contributions to various open source data science projects."
