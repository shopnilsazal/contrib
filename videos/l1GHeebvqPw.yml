Nowadays, we can see big companies spending a lot of money on these programs, while understanding that this is the right way to secure software. However, there are lots of black spots in these programs which most of you are not aware of, such as handling with black hat hackers, ability to control the testers, etc. Henceforth, this presentation explains the current behaviors around these programs and predicts what we should see in the future.\n\nNir is employed by NCR Corporation as Enterprise Security Architect of NCR Retail, and also works as co-founder and CTO in his start-up company, Crowdome. Before the acquisition of Retalix by NCR, Nir was the Chief Security Officer of R&D in the company. As part of his previous positions in the last decade, he has worked as Chief Security Architect, Senior Technology Consultant, Application Security Consultant, Systems Infrastructure Security Consultant and a Technological Trainer. While in these positions, Nir was not only consulting, but also performing hands-on activities in various fields, i.e. hardening, penetration testing, and development for personal\\internal applications. In addition, Nir released an open source anti-defacement tool called AntiDef and has written a publication about QRbot, an iPhone QR botnet POC he developed.\n\nNir has a BSc in computer science, but his knowledge is based mainly on cowboy learning and information sharing with the techno-oriented communities."
