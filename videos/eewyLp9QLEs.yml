title: '#HITB2016AMS D1T2 - CSP Oddities - Michele Spagnuolo and Lukas Weichselbaum'
recordingDate: 1466484896
description: "Content Security Policy (CSP) is a defense-in-depth mechanism to restrict resources that can be loaded, embedded and executed in a web application, significantly reducing the risk and impact of injections. It is supported by most modern browsers, and it already is at its third iteration – yet, adoption in the web is struggling.\n\nIn this presentation we will highlight the major roadblocks that make CSP deployment difficult, common mistakes, talk about what works and what doesn’t in different browsers, show how easy it is to defeat the whitelist-based model with some juicy bypasses, for example thanks to JSONP endpoints, by abusing a CDN and loading outdated versions of AngularJS.\n\nFinally, we present a radically new way of doing CSP in a simpler, easier to maintain and more secure way based on nonces and making use of a new feature we contributed to CSP3.\n\nWe hope that after attending this talk you will understand how tricky it can be to deploy an effective CSP policy and what are the common mistakes to avoid, and as an attacker you will get resources and pointers on how well is CSP keeping up with modern web technologies, and how to break it.\n\nFun is guaranteed!\n\nThe Content Security Policy (CSP) is a mechanism to whitelist content sources in a web application, significantly reducing the risk and impact of injections in the web application by limiting content\n\n======\n\nMichele Spagnuolo, Information Security Engineer at Google, is a security researcher focused on web application security. His name appears in several Halls of Fame such as Google, Yahoo, eBay, Adobe, Shopify, Nokia, Opera, Mailchimp, etc. He reported several security vulnerabilities to vendors and web administrators. Bitcoin enthusiast, author of BitIodine, the first open source Bitcoin forensic framework.\n\n------\n\nLukas Weichselbaum is an Information Security Engineer at Google.
