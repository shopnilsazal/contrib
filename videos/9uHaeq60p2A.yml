description: "Privacy In DSRC Connected Vehicles \nCHRISTIE DUDLEY PRIVACY LEGAL RESEARCHER\n\nTo date, remote vehicle communications such as OnStar have provided little in the way of privacy. The planned DSRC system will become the first large-scale nationwide direct public participation network outside of the internet. Much information and misinformation has been spread on what the upcoming DSRC system is and can do, especially in the information security community. The recent field trial in the US of a connected vehicle infrastructure raises the level of concern amongst all who are aware of existing privacy issues.\n\nIn this talk I will examine the current system high level design for North American vehicles, as set by international standards and used in a recent road test in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. I will consider privacy concerns for each portion of the system, identifying how they may be addressed by current approaches or otherwise considered solutions. I conclude with a discussion of the strategic value in engaging the privacy community during development efforts and the potential community role in raising privacy as a competitive advantage.\n\nChristie Dudley (@longobord) started her career with a BSEE with an emphasis in digital communications from the University of Kansas. A 15 year enterprise network engineer career, largely in finance and manufacturing followed. Starting with a study in anthropology she decided to change fields, eventually pursuing an old interest in communications security and privacy and a brief internship in hardware security. Seeking to combine her interests in technology and society she began pursuing the field from a new perspective, enrolling as JD candidate at Santa Clara Law. She now consults on privacy issues related to communications technology while completing her law degree. She has also cofounded Fork the Law, an effort to bridge the gap between technologists and legislation.\n\nMaterials: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Dudley/DEFCON-21-Dudley-Privacy-In-DSRC-Connected-Vehicles-Updated.pdf"
