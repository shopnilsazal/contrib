title: 'MountainWest RubyConf 2015 - Message Oriented Programming'
recordingDate: 1427736769
description: "by Brian Knapp\n“I’m sorry that I long ago coined the term “objects” for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea. The big idea is “messaging” - that is what the kernal of Smalltalk/Squeak is all about (and it’s something that was never quite completed in our Xerox PARC phase).” - Alan Kay\nObject oriented programming is what gets a lot of attention, and it is often set in opposition to functional programming. However, it seems that OOP with its focus on classes, inheritence, and polymorphism missed what Alan Kay was really working on - messaging systems.\nIn this talk we will examine the fundamental pieces to what I am calling message oriented programming. We will look at the request/response message pattern, we will look at the structure of messages themselves, and we will look at how protocols can be created to enforce a sane message passing system.\nWe will also look at how this fits with Ruby, OOP, FP, and modern distributed computing patterns like REST, SOA and microservices. They are all related an it’s clear that message oriented programming has a place in the programmer’s toolbox. In fact, we are already using message oriented program to power modern applications, we just don’t know it yet.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GWI7/"
