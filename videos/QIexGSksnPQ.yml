description: "This 2016 VRDC talk covers the entire process, from start to finish, of making Epic Games' Bullet Train VR Demo. Epic's Nick Donaldson and Nick Whiting cover design considerations surrounding the user experience of adding interaction to traditionally passive experiences, and discuss where they had to diverge from their original design choices in order to match the players' expectations of the world they interact with.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
