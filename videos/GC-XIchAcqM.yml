description: "What I Learned to Love About Ruby When I Switched to Python by Lauren Ellsworth\n\nWhen I switched from a Ruby based company to a Python based company, things I had taken for granted in my Ruby life were suddenly sorely missed, and the transition to a language with only one way to do the same thing created quite a few bumps in the road. This talks draws parallels between Ruby and Python, spotlighting which brought the most developer happiness, what I miss and love about Ruby, and what Ruby can learn from Python."
