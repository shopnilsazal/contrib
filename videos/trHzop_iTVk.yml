recordingDate: 1363654856
description: "With any new programming language or technology, you have the chicken-and-egg problem: \"You need the experience to get the job, but you need the job to get the experience.\" In Erlang's case, There are two things that make this more acute: The kind of systems that Erlang is particularly good for are exactly the kind of systems that you don't want to be building if you don't know what you're doing; and Erlang is not like the other kids. If you're new to functional programming, it's a whole 'nother country, and Erlang has some unusual syntax and language features on top of that. We'll talk about how to get around these early hurdles, and why learning Erlang is its own reward.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGdp/"
