description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\nThursday, September 18 • 9:30am - 10:15am\n\nBuilding Your Application Security Data Hub: The Imperative for Structured Vulnerability Information\n\nOne of the reasons application security is so challenging to address is that it spans multiple teams within an organization. Development teams build software, security testing teams find vulnerabilities, security operations staff manage applications in production and IT audit organizations make sure that the resulting software meets compliance and governance requirements. In addition, each team has a different toolbox they use to meet their goals, ranging from scanning tools, defect trackers, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), WAFs and GRC systems. Unfortunately, in most organizations the interactions between these teams is often strained and the flow of data between these disparate tools and systems is non-existent or tediously implemented manually. \n\nIn today’s presentation, we will demonstrate how leading organizations are breaking down these barriers between teams and better integrating their disparate tools to enable the flow of application security data between silos to accelerate and simplify their remediation efforts. At the same time, we will show how to collect the proper data to measure the performance and illustrate the improvement of the software security program. The challenges that need to be overcome to enable teams and tools to work seamlessly with one another will be enumerated individually. Team and tool interaction patterns will also be outlined that reduce the friction that will arise while addressing application security risks. Using open source products such as OWASP ZAP, ThreadFix, Bugzilla and Eclipse, a significant amount of time will also be spent demonstrating the kinds of interactions that need to be enabled between tools. This will provide attendees with practical examples on how to replicate a powerful, integrated Application Security program within their own organizations. In addition, how to gather program-wide metrics and regularly calculate measurements such as mean-time-to-fix will also be demonstrated to enable attendees to monitor and ensure the continuing health and performance of their Application Security program.\n\nSpeaker\nDan Cornell\nCTO, Denim Group\nDan Cornell has over twelve years of experience architecting and developing web-based software systems.
