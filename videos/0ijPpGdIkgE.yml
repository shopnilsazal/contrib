He occasionally tweets @uoodsq.\n\nIn a security product used to secure access to mission-critical applications, logging and auditing is incredibly important. Recently, Duo Security transitioned its authentication log storage from MySQL to Elasticsearch. In this talk, Bryan will talk about life before the transition, some of the reasons why they chose to make the transition, what went into the design process, the challenges they faced along the way, and the benefits they gained from the transition."
