description: "Description from DEF CON 9 Speakerâ€™s Page: \nAttacking & Securing Red Hat AKA How Effective Has Bastille Linux Been?\nThis talk will demonstrate each of the major (widely available) exploits against Red Hat 6.x, before and after hardening the system with Bastille Linux.\_ The idea is to show, very concretely, how Bastille Linux was effective at stopping/containing attacks, before the exploit was ever written.\_ This is not simply a \"product demo\" for an Open Source tool, though! We'll describe exactly what hardening steps are taken to combat each attack and illustrate how these prevented/contained a compromise.\n\nJay Beale is the Security Team Director at MandrakeSoft, makers of Mandrake Linux. He is also the Lead Developer of the Bastille Linux Project, which creates a hardening program for Linux.\_ Jay is the author of a number of articles on Unix/Linux security, along with the upcoming book Securing Linux the Bastille Way, to be published by Addison-Wesley. You can learn more about his articles, talks and favorite security links via http://www.bastille-linux.org/jay."
