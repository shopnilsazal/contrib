description: "Interpolation Search Can Be Fast, in Some Situations, Sometimes, If You Try! by Ruchir Khaitan\n\nWhen was the last time you binary searched a phone book? Never? What, you’ve never used a phone book? Okay, fine, I’ve never actually used a phone book for anything other than a doorstop either. But, if I had to search in one I would use interpolation search. It’s the ideal search algorithm / data structure for searching large arrays repeatedly. And with a little bit of operator-strength reducing math sorcery, it’s not just theoretically fast, it’s also useful in real life!\n\nRuchir loves making computers go faster. He also loves eating, cooking and thinking about his next meal. He works on the Real Time Platform Team at AppNexus."
