description: "Privacy is fairly cut and dry when it’s US verses THEM, but what if it’s ME verses YOU within US? What are YOUR Privacy Rights, in the context of OUR relationship?  Am I your non-trusting girlfriend?  Am I your controlling boyfriend?  Am I your snooping wife? Am I your abusive husband?  How do YOU protect your privacy from ME?  I will be providing tips, techniques, and resources to enable someone (anyone – even YOU) to protect their Privacy in a relationship, perhaps even one with ME.  \n\nHighlights will include ways you can be surveilled, at home techniques you can use to protect yourself when using your phone and computer, and individual privacy rights within a marriage. Presented by someone who may have needed the information, and had to discover this path themselves, and is zealous about assisting those in need of this talk.  Even YOU."
