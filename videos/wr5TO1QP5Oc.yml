recordingDate: 1385420241
description: "Eric Smith & Dr. Shana Dardan: Medical Identity Theft\nIn less than an hour, during a scheduled pentest, our team was able to retrieve 3.2 million patient insurance records from a HIPAA-compliant medical facility. Using these records, we could have generated counterfeit insurance and prescription cards which would pass muster at any doctor's office or pharmacy counter. If you are one of the 47 million Americans with no health insurance or happen to have a medical condition you wished to hide from employers or insurers, would you consider purchasing falsified medical documents? Thousands of Americans have already said yes, without thinking twice about the victim of their victimless crime.\n\nWhat happens to you if your medical identity is stolen? You may find yourself liable for thousands of dollars of co-pays, deductibles, and denied claims. Is this because you forgot to shred an important document? Did you fall for a phishing scheme online? Of course not -- it was entirely outside of your control, and it happened because the current HIPAA regulations are insufficient to protect your medical identity.\n\nIn this talk, we'll review the current state of HIPAA and other laws covering the security of your medical records, and discuss what changes need to be made, both in policy in practice, to shore up the security of our medical records.\n\nEric Smith is Assistant Director of Information Security and Networking at Bucknell University, located in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.
