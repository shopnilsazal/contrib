description: "Data-Driven Government and the Ruby Developer by Eric Mill\n\nA radically new relationship between developers and our government is taking shape. All levels of governmentâ€”federal agencies, states, and citiesâ€”have begun opening their vast troves of data to citizens, free of charge and license.\n\nIt started small, but as inspired citizens, including many Ruby developers, have taken government data and created awesome apps, more and more governments have taken the leap to give their data away. Some have even started collaborating with citizens and creating new government services that never existed before.\n\nIt's a historic and powerful opportunity for us as Ruby developers, and we need to take advantage of it. This talk is about why you should care, what your fellow developers have been doing so far, and what you might do yourself.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GZSi/"
