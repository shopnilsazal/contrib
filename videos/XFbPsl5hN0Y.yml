Just like cyber, cybercrime has become mainstream. To make optimal use of the chances that the digital domain has to offer, we need to work together: governments, companies and hacker communities, nationally and internationally, to strengthen our digital security.\n\n========\n\nPatricia Zorko is the Deputy National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism and Director Cyber Security since 1 November 2015.\n\nShe has worked for 34 years with the police holding a variety of posts including head of a community police team, policy adviser, riot squad member, member of the regional management team and district commander. In her last few years she joined the Netherlands Police Agency to coordinate the integration of the National Crime Squad with the International Police Cooperation Service. And she then went on to become chief of the National Unit of the National Police.\n\nShe has a an overarching ambition to contribute to improving security in the Netherlands and in an international context. Over the past few years she has been learning more about the challenges associated with cyber security and violent jihadism."
