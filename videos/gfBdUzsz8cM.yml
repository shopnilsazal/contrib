language: English
recordingDate: 1509390002
description: 'In an era of rapidly evolving technological advances, the ethical and regulatory frameworks are always playing catch up. Biohacking may have consequences that much more serious than traditional technologies. It is critical that as a community we discuss and try and address the ethical implications of biohacking. A wide range of topics will be discussed by the panel and the audience including: What are the ethical implications of the hacker mindset, the ability to experiment outside of traditional research settings with their safeguards, the use of methodologies developed by non benign parties, the unforeseen consequences of new discoveries, and should we build for billionaires or the billions?'
