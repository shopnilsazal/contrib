description: "\"Oh, don't ask me, I'm a terrible designer.\" That's something I've heard from Rails developers ever since I started working with them. But it's never true. It's just that most Rails devs don't have the scaffolding (no, not that scaffolding) around which to structure their designs.\n\nIn this talk we'll cover the things every developer should know about design: contrast, repetition, proximity, hierarchy, flow, typography, and color.\n\nJenn Scheer is a designer & developer who began designing for web but was frustrated with the inability to build it herself. She's taught design at General Assembly, to students who were clearly arming themselves for the web. She is currently at Rap Genius, helping users annotate the world.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1H/"
