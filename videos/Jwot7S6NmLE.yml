description: "FX and Halvar - Take it from here\n\"We Can Take It From Here\"\n\nSick of watching other people working their magic and still wondering how to get 0day? Write your own! This session is about the state of mind for finding and exploiting bugs. From web applications to client-server systems and multi-tier platforms down to routers, switches and wrist watches - everything has bugs and everything can be exploited one way or another.\n\nBut of course, a state of mind alone doesn't get you 0day. Now you need to find a crack in the armor that you can pry open and drive your truck through.\n\nThe session will try to guide you through how to find a bug, how to combine several of them or how to circumvent things that would ruin your plan, starting from how to do educated guesses down to diff and patch review. \n\nDon't be scared, have no phear. Found a bug but you have no idea what to do with it? A strange CPU, a never-seen-before platform or an unknown protocol should not prevent you from getting r00t anyway. This last part deals with guidelines on shell and non-shell codes, binary or not, and with handling complicated platforms.\n\nThe goal is that you walk out with your own 0day already developing in your mind.\n\nFX of Phenoelit is the leader of the German Phenoelit group. His and the group's primary interests are in security implementations and implications of standards or less-known protocols, as shown on past DefCon conventions. FX has a fairly special relationship with shops like Cisco Systems and HP as well as SAP. Currently, he works as a Security Solution Consultant at n.runs GmbH.\n\nHalvar Flake is Black Hat's resident reverse engineer. Originating in the fields of copy protection, he moved more and more towards network security after realizing the potential for reverse engineering as a tool for vulnerability analysis. He spends most of his screen time in a disassembler (or developing extensions for the disassembler), likes to read source code diff's with his breakfast and enjoys giving talks about his research interests. He drinks tea but does not smoke camels."
