description: "In a world where governments are demanding exceptional (and unprecedented) access to systems under the guise of national security and the looming specter of terrorism, recent events have resurfaced the conflict between privacy and security. While some believe this to be a new battle of the Internet age, it’s just a continuation of the unending crypto war between technologists and law enforcement.\n\nMr Adams will give a brief overview of the recent FBI vs. Apple debate, how companies with large amounts of user data typically respond to law enforcement requests, and what developers can do to continue the fight for the users.\n\n======\n\nJohn Adams (@netik) is the Head of Security at Bolt Financial, an emerging payments start-up based in San Francisco. Prior to this, He was the one of the founding members of Twitter’s operations team, and later, a founding member of Twitter’s Information Security team. He is also an independent security consultant and privacy advocate with over 25 years experience in Information Security, having had his start in security with the L0pht in the early 90’s.\n\nIn addition to this, he serves as a member of the Open Technology Fund Advisory Council and Rapid Response Team, supporting projects that empower world citizens to have access to modern communication channels that are free of restrictions.\n\nHe is a frequent speaker at universities, conferences, and is a contributor to publications on operations (O’Reilly Web Operations, O’Reilly Twitter API) and security  (The Intercept, RSA Conference, Usenix LISA, Washington Post, Wired, and more.)"
