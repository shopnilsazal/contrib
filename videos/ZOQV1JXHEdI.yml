description: 'Over the course of making Sunset Overdrive, the team created and scrapped not one, but two different open world cities - before settling on the third. This talk from Insomniac''s Liz England, given at the Level Design In A Day workshop at GDC 2015, walks attendees through each of these worlds. It shows how the changing vision of the game demanded major changes to the level design, focusing on the evolving role of traversal and the growing pains of building spaces for fast-paced open world gameplay. Takeaways include identifying when and why you might need a hard reset during production, and key design lessons for building tightly integrated open world spaces.'
