recordingDate: 1516816640
description: 'Have you ever tried to visualize a system you are working on? There are lots of tools that can help, they create nice diagrams (UML) or charts. They work, but after a while are boring. Because they are flat! Thanks to the new toys such as Oculus Rift or HTC Vive you can see the things from a new perspective. You can actually immerse yourself in code. Imagine: you can walk around the classes and touch methods with your hands. That is crazy experience... a toy - but maybe a revolution and new way of looking at dashboards, diagrams ..and maybe your future IDE. I will show you my experiments and how to quickly build similar ones with webvr and aframe framework.'
