description: "\"Pythonic JavaScript for Web Developers\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-12 - PythonAnywhere Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nHaving a basic knowledge of JavaScript is obligatory for every Web developer in todays world. Most of us are familiar with the pain of having to write some simple hide/show logic and ajax queries with jQuery on a page that is mostly rendered server-side. Nowadays, however, there are lots of great JavaScript frameworks and build tools that not only make these things very easy to do The Right Way, but also make the whole process quite painless.\n\nI spent past year in a small startup writing only front-end code and evaluating different tools and best practises. Bringing these tools to old Django projects has been eye-opening. There are practically no documentation or code examples on how to integrate these things to Python backend projects, so it’s very hard to get started from scratch. In this talk we’ll go trough some of the tools, examples on how to get started, and also some coding guidelines on how to make JavaScript look and feel more sane and Pythonic.\n\nThe current state of JavaScript frameworks is notoriously bad; there are more of them than blog engines written with Django. We’ll focus on Vue.js (https://vuejs.org) which is a lightweight, very easy to get started and yet powerful tool.\n\nWe’ll also take a look at new end-to-end browser test tools and modern build tools that enable us to take full advantage of the huge NPM package universe (Cheeseshop for JS)  and write modern ES2015/ES2016 JavaScript that has more powerful and cleaner syntax.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
