description: "by Fran√ßois Revol\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nHaiku, a free software OS, includes its own desktop, largely inspired by theBeOS. While it has a quite classic look, it still has some unique features.\n\nDespite being 15 years old, Haiku still has some nice things to show off andinspire others.\n\nFrom x-ray navigation to multithreaded-by-default applications, Haiku is meantto be responsive even on older machines.\n\nWe will also discuss how Haiku can relate to XDG standards, considering itdoesn't use X11, is not a Unix clone, and also has its share of legacy.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 10:20:00"
