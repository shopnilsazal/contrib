From Brain to Stuxnet, he's spent his\ncareer tracking malware and will give a pretty good rundown on what\nhas happened, when and why it mattered.\n\nMikko Hypponen is based in Helsinki, Finland. He has been analysing computer viruses for more than 20 years. He has written on his research for magazines such as Scientific American.\n\nAccording to information leaked by Wikileaks, the US Government has classified Mr. Hypponen as an infosec ROCK STAR (true story). He doesn't often speak publicly, but when he does, it's in venues like TED or Rubicon Detroit - or DEF CON. He's also the oldest child genius on the planet. And every time he swims, dolfins appear.\n\n\nApart from computer security issues, Mr. Hypponen enjoys collecting and restoring classic arcade video games and pinball machines from past decades.\n\nOn Twitter at http://twitter.com/mikkohypponen"
