title: 'Mike Heilman | Implementing distributed grid search for deep learning using scikit learn and joblib'
recordingDate: 1474645463
description: "PyData Chicago 2016\n\nSlides: https://mheilman.github.io/pydata_chicago_2016/#/\n\nGrid search over hyperparameters is an important but computationally expensive process in machine learning, particularly for deep learning and tree ensembles. In this talk, I will describe how one can use joblib's recently added custom backend functionality to do distributed grid search on Amazon EC2 for a TensorFlow deep text classifier that follows the scikit-learn estimator API."
