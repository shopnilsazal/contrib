description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\n\nThursday, September 18 • 1:00pm - 1:45pm\nStatic Analysis for Dynamic Assessments\n\n \nToday’s dynamic and static web vulnerability scanners are capable of analyzing complex web applications for security weaknesses. They automate testing of many common vulnerabilities. However, there is a gap between Static and Dynamic scanners. They find different vulnerabilities. So why aren’t dynamic testers running static tools? Typically, they don’t have source code.\n\nIn this session, Greg will explore ways dynamic testers can utilize static tools without source code. Greg will discuss a process for collecting and scanning client-side files. Furthermore, Greg will demonstrate a custom developed tool that automates this process from the Burp Suite.\n\nThe objective of running static analysis during a dynamic assessment is to reduce potential false-negatives by increasing the breadth of the assessment.\n\nSpeaker\n\nGreg Patton\nSenior Security Consultant, HP Fortify\nGreg Patton is a Sr. Security Consultant with HP Fortify on Demand based in Houston, TX.
