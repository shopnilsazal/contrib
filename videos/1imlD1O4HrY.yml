title: 'AppSensor: Real-Time Event Detection and Response - John Melton - AppSecUSA 2015'
recordingDate: 1445347913
description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2015 in San Francisco\nhttps://2015.appsecusa.org/\n\nAppSensor is a very active OWASP project that defines a conceptual framework, methodology, guidance and reference implementation to design and deploy malicious behavior detection and automated responses directly within software applications. The AppSensor idea was first conceived in 2008 and is the leading reference point in this area. More recently \"application self-protection\" has become a hot topic.\n\nThere are many security protections available to applications today. AppSensor builds on these by providing a mechanism that allows architects and developers to build into their applications a way to detect events and attacks, then automatically respond to them. Not only can this stop and/or reduce the impact of an attack, it gives you incredibly valuable visibility and security intelligence about the operational state of your applications.\n\nThe AppSensor project has released v2 this year. In this special presentation for AppSec USA, you will discover what AppSensor is and what it can offer you. The interesting features available in v2 will be covered along with upcoming features from the roadmap. In addition, you will learn how to cover different use cases with AppSensor by a walk-through of some sample applications. Lastly, you will receive information about the different components and integrations that make AppSensor enterprise-friendly.\n\nTake-aways you will have from this presentation are:\n\n* Knowledge about the benefits of proactive protection\n* Information of the features in the new free-to-use reference implementation\n* Guidance on implementing AppSensor in the real world\n* Pointers to supporting materials specifically created for developers, architects, and senior management.\n* Free copy of the 200-page v2 AppSensor Guide (also always available as a free PDF)\n\nAdditionally John and other members of the project team will be available after the presentation to continue discussion of the approach, and the AppSensor reference implementation.\n\nJohn Melton\nPrincipal Security Researcher, WhiteHat Security\nJohn Melton: I'm the lead developer for OWASP AppSensor, which I discovered after building a nearly identical tool, and looking for prior art. | | For my day job, I am currently a principal security researcher at WhiteHat Security, where I do R&D work, particularly in the static analysis space.\n\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
