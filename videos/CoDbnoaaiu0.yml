description: "\"Python Microservices\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - Anfiteatro 2]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nThis talk is for Python web developers interested in learning what are the core ideas behind microservices, what problems they try to solve, and what are the viable options to implement them in Python, both from technical and teamwork point of views. Some of the topics that will be discussed include the role of APIs, the improvements microservices bring to application scalability, upgrades, and maintenance, and the challenges in breaking up a monolithic application.\n\nAttendees will leave the talk with a good idea of what microservices are, and how they help build better applications. As usual with my presentations, there will be actual code examples presented during the talk that I will also host on GitHub, for those interested in investigating further on their own.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
