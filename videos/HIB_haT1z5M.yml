description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nPod Anomaly Detection and Eviction using Prometheus Metrics - David Benque & Cedric Lamoriniere, Amadeus (Beginner Skill Level)\n\nDealing with system stability in a distributed and changing environment is a challenge: a single failing pod can affect the majority of your system responses. From Kubernetes probes to Istio circuit breaker, the CNCF projects provide us multiple means of containing this kind of problem. After a quick review of all these means, understanding in which cases they can be used and their limitations, we will see how to react to problems that can only be revealed by internal application KPIs. Maybe you would have liked to use a service mesh circuit breaker feature, however your traffic is not HTTP based; or, one pod continues to reply with HTTP code 200 alongside incorrect functional content. And yet, you have functional indicators that that could help take an immediate and orchestrated operational response. We will see how to cover such cases thanks to dedicated controllers and Prometheus.\n\nAbout David\nSenior software engineer at Amadeus. Area of expertize: PaaS. Working on: application development, automation, system operability at scale, distributed systems. Languages: Go, C++ mainly. Like: sharing experience, learn and teach. My mission at Amadeus is to implement the transition from our legacy distributed system to cloud native environment using Openshift. First time speaker in public conference. Private talks or meetup talks already done.\n\nAbout Cedric\nCedric Lamoriniere is a software developer at Amadeus working on the integration of Openshift in the new internal PaaS \"\"Amadeus Cloud Services\"\". Cedric is specialized in distributed systems development. His first public speaking experience happens last year at the RedisConf (SF) where he presented a Kubernetes Redis-Operator."
