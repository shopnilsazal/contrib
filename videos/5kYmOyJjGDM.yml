description: "Elixir provides the joy and productivity of Ruby with the concurrency and fault-tolerance of Erlang. Together, we'll take a guided tour through the language, going from the very basics to macros and distributed programming. Along the way, we'll see how Elixir embraces concurrency and how we can construct self-healing programs that restart automatically on failure. Attendees should leave with a great head-start into Elixir, some minor language envy, and a strong desire to continue exploration.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGZr/"
