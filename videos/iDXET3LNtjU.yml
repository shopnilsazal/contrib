description: "Asserting identity by means of lightweight JSON Web Tokens (JWT) - this is what OpenID Connect is basically about. In this lecture we'll learn how clients (web, mobile, native apps) can obtain an ID token using standard OAuth 2.0 flows, and how to process them. We'll also take a look at a few supplementary protocols designed to make the whole experience of login a lot smoother, more democratic and privacy aware. For those who dare we may also touch nasty OAuth 2.0 stuff.\n\nIntervenant : Vladimir Dzhuvinov"
