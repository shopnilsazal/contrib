description: "by Thomas Graf\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThis talk demonstrates that programmability and performance does not requireuser space networking, it can be achieved in the kernel by generating BPFprograms and leveraging the existing kernel subsystems. We will demo an earlyprototype which provides fast IPv6 & IPv4 connectivity to containers,container labels based security policy with avg cost O(1), and debugging andmonitoring based on the per-cpu perf ring buffer.\n\n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 12:30:00"
