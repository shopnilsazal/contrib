Even when one decides toembark on this journey, their path is often hindered by the lack or quality oftools, resources they will be using, and are often turned away by the lack ofsuccess and their feeling of \"coding is not for me\" is often reinforced by allthese negative experiences. This is where Happy Code Friends, Code Invadersand Clouduboy tries to help - introduce coding, hardware and IoT in afriendly, impulse-rich, exciting environment to anyone willing to givecomputers a try.\n\nLearning to code might be the handiest skill of the XXI. century - but findingmotivation to do so seems to be the hardest part.

Code Invaders is a freeonline webpage/tutorial teaching basic JavaScript programming concepts bybuilding an online game. Clouduboy is a free web-based tool for creating HTML5games with JavaScript and running/playing them on tiny microcontrollers.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 14:00:00"
