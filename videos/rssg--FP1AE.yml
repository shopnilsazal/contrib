title: 'OWASP BeNeLux Day Don''t trust the DOM: Bypassing XSS mitigations via script gadgets by S. Lekies'
language: English
recordingDate: 1511822909
description: "Abstract\nCross-Site Scripting is a constant problem of the Web platform. Over the years many techniques have been introduced to prevent or mitigate XSS. Most of these techniques, thereby, focus on script tags and event handlers. HTML sanitizers, for example, aim at removing potentially dangerous tags and attributes. Another example is the Content Security Policy, which forbids inline event handlers and aims at white listing of legitimate scripts.\nIn this talk, we present a novel Web hacking technique that enables an attacker to circumvent most XSS mitigations. In order to do so, the attacker abuses so-called script gadgets. A script gadget Is a legitimate piece of JavaScript in a page that reads elements from the DOM via selectors and processes them in a way that results in script execution. To abuse a script gadget, the attacker injects a benign looking element into the page that matches the gadget's selector. Subsequently, the gadget selects the benign-looking element and executes attacker-controlled scripts. As the initially injected element is benign it passes HTML sanitizers and security policies. The XSS only surfaces when the gadget mistakenly elevates the privileges of the element.\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate that these gadgets are present in almost all modern JavaScript libraries, APIs and applications. We will present several case studies and real-world examples that demonstrate that many mitigation techniques are not suited for modern applications. As a result, we argue that the Web should start focusing more on preventive mechanisms instead of mitigations.\n\nBio\nSebastian Lekies is tech leading the Web application security scanning team at Google.
