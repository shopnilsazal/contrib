description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nObserving and Troubleshooting your Microservices with Istio - Isaiah Snell-feikema, IBM & Douglas Reid, Google (Beginner Skill Level)\n\nIstio, an open platform to connect, secure and manage microservices has become the de facto service mesh standard. As developers migrate their legacy or their newly built cloud native application to Istio, one of the top challenges is observability and troubleshooting when things don't go well. This session will describe and demonstrate how developers can gain observability of Istio and the microservices deployed onto Istio, along with common troubleshooting tips to get you use Istio easily.\n\nAbout Douglas\nDouglas is a core contributor to the Istio effort, primarily focused on Observability and Integrations. Prior to working on Istio, he spent 4 years working on the Google-internal precursors to Istio.\n\nAbout Isaiah\nIsaiah is a core contributor to Istio networking. Prior to Istio, he worked on precursor service mesh related projects whose concepts were later folded into Istio. Before his time working on open source, he worked on IBM cloud services and infrastructure."
