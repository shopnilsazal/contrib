description: "Keynote: Can 100 Million Developers Use Kubernetes? - Alexis Richardson, CEO, Weaveworks\n\nWhat is the potential for Kubernetes? Is it like Openstack and Hadoop, a technology for expert operators in the enterprise? Or is it like cloud and mobile, a way for every developer to move the business? What is needed for Kubernetes to have an impact equal to the web? Can 100 million people use Kubernetes?\n\nAbout Alexis Richardson\nAlexis is the co-founder and CEO of Weaveworks. He is also the chairman of the TOC for CNCF, and the co-founder of the Coed:Code meet ups.\n\nPreviously he was at Pivotal, as head of products for Spring, RabbitMQ, Redis, Apache Tomcat and vFabric. Alexis was responsible for resetting the product direction of Spring and transitioning the vFabric business from VMware. \n\nAlexis co-founded RabbitMQ, and was CEO of the Rabbit company acquired by VMware in 2010, where he worked on numerous cloud platforms. Rumours persist that he co-founded several other software companies including Cohesive Networks, after a career as a prop trader in fixed income derivatives, and a misspent youth studying and teaching mathematical logic."
