description: "Pablo Enfedaque - Decorators demystified\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nDo you know what happens every time you use the **@** symbol in Python?\n\nIn this talk we will see the magic behind the _syntactic sugar_ of the\ndecorators. To understand how they internally work we will see in\ndetail Python's **scopes**, **namespaces** and **closures**, and\nfinally we will manually apply our own handcrafted decorator.\n\nThis talk is an improved version (in English) of the talk I delivered\nat PyConES 2013 (the feedback was pretty positive):\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9-yTnJgcg4 ][1]\n\nLevel:\nIntermediate. Attendees must have previous knowledge of Python and\nshould be somehow familiar with the **'@'** notation to decorate a\nfunction.\n\nThe **slides** of the talk can be downloaded from here:\n[https://speakerdeck.com/pablito56/europython-2015-decorators-\ndemystified][2]\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9-yTnJgcg4\n[2]: https://speakerdeck.com/pablito56/europython-2015-decorators-demystified"
