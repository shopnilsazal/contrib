description: 'Sarah is a Ruby / Rails developer at Pivotal Labs and is a regular contributor to Diaspora. She also helps organize RailsBridge in San Francisco, CA. She wears a bright pink dress on Earth Day and owns a skirt with a Regular Expression reference printed upside down on it (so itâ€™s readable to her). Sheâ€™ll tell the story of how being a programmer has made her into an extrovert.'
