description: 'We will engage the audience in a discussion of modern technological advances along with their ethical implications. We live in an era where the very implanted hardware that keeps you alive can be evidence in the court of law. Neuroscience is now a tool used by marketing firms. Following this discussion on medical ethics we will continue with a show and tell of some recent cases where medical devices were used as evidence against the patients. We discuss some of the medical devices that have been tested by us in the past year and the vulnerabilities that were discovered.'
