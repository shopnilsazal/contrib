description: "WebRTC and Phoenix, when μ Seconds aren't Fast Enough by Jason Stiebs\n\nWebRTC brings peer-to-peer communication to the browser in a way that could revolutionize the modern web. Phoenix Channels are great for real-time client server apps, but sometimes parts of your application need lower latency that only P2P can offer. From telephony to video conferencing, P2P communication will drive the next generation of web applications. We'll review WebRTC from the ground up, and what you can expect when using it. Along the way, we'll see code from a real-world application and the lessons learned integrating WebRTC with Phoenix channels."
