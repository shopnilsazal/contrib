description: "client-go: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly - Lili Cosic, Kinvolk\n\nThis talk will focus on client-go, a go client for talking to Kubernetes clusters. At Kinvolk we have used client-go in various Kubernetes projects. Lili will share the general use-case of client-go and explain how powerful it is to customize, optimize, and automate tasks with it. Furthermore she will explore the parts that client-go is great at, as well as the parts that can still be improved. Lili will end with a demo showing how easy it is to harvest the power of client-go, and showcase how it can be used to customize your Kubernetes experience and solve real problems.\n\nAbout Lili Cosic\nLili is a Software Developer at Kinvolk, a Berlin-based Linux development consultancy, where she works on a variety of projects surrounding Linux. Currently she is working on a Habitat Operator, a controller to easily create and manage Habitat Services on Kubernetes. In her free time she enjoys experimenting with Kubernetes. Previously she worked at Wimdu, as a Ruby developer, helping build tools to process large amounts of data."
