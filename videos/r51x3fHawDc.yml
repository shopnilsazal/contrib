recordingDate: 1363717910
description: "Kai Li, Princeton University\nFrom FAST '13, the 11th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies\n\nData Domain is an example of a storage company with disruptive innovation during the past decade. The company started in 2001 with the mission to create and deploy deduplication storage products to replace tapes in data centers. The company went public in 2007 and was acquired by EMC Corporation in 2009. The revenue of the Data Domain product line has successfully disrupted the tape automation market.\n\nHow was Data Domain created? What makes Data Domain successful? In this talk, I will share my experience with the conference attendees to answer these two questions and also present my views on the creation of disruptive innovations, the relationship between academic research and innovation, and why most large companies are incapable of disruptive innovations."
