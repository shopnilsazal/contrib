description: "Since it’s introduction at WWDC in 2014 Swift has progressed significantly as a language and has seen increased adoption by iOS and OSX developers. Despite this, information pertaining to reverse engineering Swift applications is sparse and not openly discussed. This talk will dive into the Swift language and explore reverse engineering Swift apps from a security perspective. Topics that will be covered include quick intro to Swift from a pen testers perspective, various methods for obtaining class information from Swift binaries, Objective-C/Swift bridging, Swift runtime manipulation and function hooking.\n\n=== \n\nMichael Gianarakis is the Director of Trustwave SpiderLabs’ Asia Pacific practice where he oversees the delivery of technical security services in the region.
