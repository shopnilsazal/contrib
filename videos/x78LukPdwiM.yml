description: "Julie Pichon - I want to help! How to make your first contribution to open-source.\n[EuroPython 2014]\n[23 July 2014]\n\nDo you like open-source? Would you like to give back somehow but are not sure what to do or where to start? Together we will look at the usual workflow for making any kind of contribution, using a real patch as an example.\n\n-----\n\nThis talk aims to show at a high-level what is the process for contributing to most open-source projects. We will go from discovering a project to how to find the contributor guidelines, prepare your contribution for submission and what happens next. The general principles will be illustrated with an example from the speaker's first contribution to OpenStack.\n\nThe target audience for the talk is people who have never contributed to open-source, though they would like to. Although the example will be a code contribution, the process as described applies to all kinds of contributions."
