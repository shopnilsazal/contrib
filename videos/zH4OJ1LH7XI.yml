description: "Building the web for everyone  by: Greg Tarnoff\n\nOne in six people in the united states has a \"disability\". Some of these prevent them from using the internet. They may have low or no vision, balance issues, hearing issues, or motor control issues. I'll discuss what we can do as developers to conquer these hurdles and deliver a rich user experience to everyone regardless of abilities. Technology can be the great equalizer if we spend a little time making it so. It's easier than supporting IE6."
