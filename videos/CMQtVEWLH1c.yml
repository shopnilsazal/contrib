description: "In this talk by Tracy Lee you can learn how to create a more composable application architecture and an arsenal of lego bricks with RxJS, a push based primitive and domain specific language that sits on top of JavaScript. With its more declarative syntax and intrinsic portability, learn how to use RxJS in Angular, React, and Vue and what the future holds for for reactive primitives in TC39 and WHATWG.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”.
