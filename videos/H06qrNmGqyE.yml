Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nKeynote: Switching Horses Midstream: The Challenges of Migrating 150+ Microservices to Kubernetes - Sarah Wells, Technical Director for Operations and Reliability, Financial Times\n\nThe FT content platform team put our&nbsp;first containers live in mid-2015 and migrated the rest of our services over&nbsp;by April 2016. At that point, we weren't using Kubernetes - and much of what we were using, we built ourselves. At the end of 2016, we decided we wanted to benefit from the work other people were doing and switch over to Kubernetes. But it's not easy to do that kind of move when you have 150+ microservices and you need to keep the existing platform running in parallel while you do the migration. I'm going to talk about this migration and the challenges we faced.\n\nAbout Sarah\nSarah Wells has been a developer for 15 years, leading delivery teams across consultancy, financial services and media. Over the last few years she has developed a deep interest in operability, observability and devops, and this has recently led to her taking over responsibility for Operations and Reliability at the Financial Times. Before that, she lead work at the FT on building a semantic publishing platform, making it easy to discover and access all the FTâ€™s published content via APIs in a common and flexible format. That project meant a focus on Go, microservices, containerisation, and how to influence teams to do the right things."
