description: "Presentation slides: http://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/anjuli-kannan-software-engineer-google-at-mlconf-sf-2016\n\nSmart Reply: Learning a Model of Conversation from Data: Smart Reply is a text assistance feature that was recently introduced to Inbox by Gmail.  Given an incoming email message, the Smartreply system analyzes its contents and suggests complete responses that the recipient can send with just one tap.  This talk will cover how we built Smartreply using a combination of deep learning and semantic clustering, as well as what we learned along the way and why we think it shows promise for the future of dialogue models."
