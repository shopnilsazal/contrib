description: "Zoz - Pwned By The Owner: What Happens When You Steal A Hacker's Computer\nHaving your place broken into and your computer stolen can be a nightmare. Getting revenge on the fucker who has your machine can be a dream come true. I had the opportunity to experience both of these when my machine was stolen in Boston and then showed up in Las Vegas 2 years later. Come share some laughs at a lamer's expense, participate in the pwnage, and learn some resulting insights into the implications of certain security decisions.\n\nZoz is a software hacker, social engineer, and all-around sneaky bastard when the occasion demands. He loves his Mac like his first born.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
