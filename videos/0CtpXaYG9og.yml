description: "Rails Engines are useful. We can make our code well structured and reusable using Engines.\n\nRails Engines are fun. You can publish your Engine repo to the world, then make yourself and the world better and happier.\n\nRails Engine is a sophisticated system. Even though 猿人 (en-jin) in Japanese means \"ape-man\".\n\nRails Engine is zen. Everything in our Rails app is an Engine, and Engine is everything. Even the Rails app itself should also be an Engine.\n\nDuring my talk, you will get to know what exactly Rails::Engine is, and you will see some of my crazy Engine tips, ideas, and implementations around Rails::Engine.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8m/"
