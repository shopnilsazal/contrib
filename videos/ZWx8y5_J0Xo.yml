description: "Copy of the slides for this talk are here: \nhttps://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Atlas/DEFCON-20-Atlas-Sub-Ghz-or-Bust.pdf\nExtra Materials: https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Atlas/Extras.zip \natlas 0f d00m c0rp0ration\n\nWifi is cool and so is cellular, but the real fun stuff happens below the GHz line. Medical systems, mfg plant/industrial systems, cell phones, power systems, it's all in there!\n\natlas and some friends set out to turn pink girltech toys into power-systems-attack tools. Through several turns and changes, the cc1111usb project was born, specifically to make attacking these systems easier for all of you. With a $50 usb dongle, the world of ISM sub-GHz is literally at your fingertips.\n\nNew and improved! If you missed it at shmoocon, here's your chance to see the intro to this fun new world. If you caught it at shmoo, come to the talk and prove your \natlas is a doer of stuff. Inspired by the illustrious sk0d0, egged on by invisigoth of kenshoto, atlas has done a lot of said 'stuff' and lived to talk about it. Whether he's breaking out of virtual machines, breaking into banks, or breaking into power systems, atlas is always entertaining, educational and fun.\nTwitter: @at1as"
