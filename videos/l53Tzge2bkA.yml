description: "by Conrad Bebbington\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nNote: here AES refers to the Audio Engineering Society, not the AdvancedEncryption Standard. The growing field of pro-audio networking has recentlyseen demand for movement away from proprietary technologies towards openstandards. One of the most significant resulting standards is AES67 whichcovers high quality audio transport over IP networks. This talk covers themotivations driving the standardization efforts and the basic details of thestandard itself.\n\nOver the past decade, the use of IP networks for pro-audio has seensignificant growth. These networks transport high quality uncompressed audioat low latency and they have been adopted in situations ranging from studiosto churches to TV broadcasts. While this field has been dominated byproprietary technologies such as Dante and Ravenna, there is now a growinginterest in moving to open standards driven by a need for compatibility andinteroperability. This talk covers one of the standards resulting from thiseffort: AES67 for audio transport.\n\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 14:30:00"
