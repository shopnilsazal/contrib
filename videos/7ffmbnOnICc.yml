title: 'GeeCON 2017: Henning Schwentner - Value types - The Next Big Thing for Java'
recordingDate: 1502695044
description: "Oracle has announced: after lambdas in Java 8 and modules in Java 9, the next big thing for Java will be the support for value types directly in the programming language. With this Java is getting a feature that other languages have already had for some time. In this talk we will look at:\n\n* what's behind the motto ''Codes like a class - works like an int''\n* why value types make your code at the same time better readable and more efficient\n* the difference between refence and value types\n* the new syntax to support value types in Java\n* how value types are implemented in other languages\n* what inheritance means for value types\n* the advantages of storing data on the stack versus storing data on the heap"
