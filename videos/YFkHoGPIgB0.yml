How could this change everything about how we interact with the physical world?\n\nBuilding upon the Bluetooth Smart standard, beacons and beacon technology is being deployed to be able to provide true, accurate discoverability of people as they move about in a physical space, all building around something you carry day in and day out, your phone. This technology is being used to revolutionize shopping, accessibility for the disabled, and is changing how we interact with the physical world.\n\nThroughout this session we will cover a number of fields of this emerging hardware market:\n* How beacons work and how they are deployed, focusing on a few major beacon types.\n* Ways that beacon technology is changing many different industries.\n* How to solve problems of deploying beacons at scale.\n* Building your own beacon using common open source hardware."
