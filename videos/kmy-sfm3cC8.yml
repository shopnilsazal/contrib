recordingDate: 1403537137
description: "PyData SV 2014 \nIn the past two years, there has been incredible progress in Python data visualization libraries, particularly those built on client-side JavaScript tools such as D3 and Leaflet. This talk will give a brief demonstration of many of the newest charting libs: mpld3 (using Seaborn/ggplot), nvd3-python, ggplot, Vincent, Bearcart, Folium,and Kartograph will be used to visualize a newly-released USGS/FAA wind energy dataset (with an assist from Pandas and the IPython Notebook). After a demo of the current state of Python and web viz, it will discuss the future of how the Python data stack can have seamless interoperability and interactivity with JavaScript visualization libraries."
