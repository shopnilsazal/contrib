All that is going on and to do can be quite daunting to New People beginning their first DefConian adventure. There are even many long time DefCon attendees who come for the talks but may feel overwhelmed or intimidated by many of the other activities happening at the Con. DefCon 101 hopes to change that by providing those people with the information they need to help take the first steps of their journey in the world of DefCon and the DefCon Community.\n\nFull Bios are available here: \nhttps://defcon.org/html/defcon-17/dc-17-speakers.html#Defcon101"
