description: "Engines are a new-to-Rails feature that really isn't all that new-to-Rails. The concept has been around for a very long time, it's just only now that they, the Rails Core Team, has Done It Right(tm). In this talk, I go through the lessons learned while developing not just one but two engines.\n\nI also provide more documentation than Rails has at the moment on engines *in one talk*.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGgb/"
