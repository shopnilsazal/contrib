description: "RubyConf 2016 - C Ruby? C Ruby Go! Go Ruby Go! by Loren Segal\n\nEver wanted to rewrite performance sensitive code as a native Ruby extension, but got stuck trying to navigate the depths of Ruby’s C API before you could get anything done? Or maybe you’re just not comfortable with C and want an easier path.\n\nDo you know any Go? Well, if you do, you’re in luck! Join us for this talk about a tool named gorb that will quickly and easily let you generate native Ruby extension wrappers for your Go programs. And if you don’t know Go, come anyway, it’s really easy to learn! We’ll have you writing blazing fast code that you can use right from Ruby, in no time at all."
