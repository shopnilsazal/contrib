description: "OSFeels 2016 - BlackGirlMagic: Being the only brown engineer by Lyn Muldrow\n\nIn an industry best suited for white and asian men where diversity is no more than a buzzword and dataset for most companies, it's easy to get lost in the shuffle, fetishized, and pushed to the side as a black woman in tech.\n\nIn both open source communities and in the workforce, black women are often excluded, misunderstood, or subject to conscious and unconscious bias that unduly effects their work effort and performance. Our feelings are to be kept at bay, lest we'd be deemed argumentative, uncooperative, or bitchy.\n\nDealing with being an 'only' has social, emotional, and other implications, and my talk will seek to illuminate a few of these feelings, while giving actionable advice on how to have empathy, understanding, and social graces when encountering and being an 'only.'\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VBz9/"
