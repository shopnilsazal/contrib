Karlsen, The Norwegian Tax Administration (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nDay 1 Scenarios like running an application or two in a namespace are pretty well covered with blog posts, videos and talks.Handling lots of existing infrastructure, legacy culture and deploying hundreds of applications in tens of namespaces, not so much. This talk will give other large/government organizations a valuable insight that will help them succeed in migrating to a kubernetes-based infrastructure. The Norwegian Tax Administration (NTA) has over the last 2 1/2 years deployed a new platform based upon Kubernetes. All new Tax-applications since 2016 and old applications run on it. The mission for our project was &lsquo;Faster Development and More Efficient Ops&rsquo;. Standardization, automation and creating tools to enable developers to add value early are key factors to achieve this. Part of the platform is OpenSource APL 2.0 https://skatteetaten.github.io/aurora-openshift\n\nAbout Bjarte\nBjarte Karlsen is an architect and developer responsible for the development/usage side of the Container Application platform that The Norwegian Tax Administration has deployed to run modernized applications. His tasks include creating tooling and code examples to support the kubernetes platform. Take a look at http://github.com/Skatteetaten and https://skatteetaten.github.io/aurora-openshift for more information."
