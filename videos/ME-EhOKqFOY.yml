Imagine you are trying to do hotspot analysis of which service and service instances are in request path for those select requests and what is causing an increase in p95 or p99 latency. We will show in this session how Istio Proxy - Envoy integrated with OpenCensus can help achieve this very easily with minimal effort from your end.\n\nAbout Varun\nProduct Management lead for gRPC and Istio at Google\n\nAbout Morgan\nMorgan Bauer works on Open Source at IBM in San Jose as part of the Cloud Division.
