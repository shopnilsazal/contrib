description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nServing ML Models at Scale with Seldon and Kubeflow - Clive Cox, Seldon.io (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nOpen source machine learning tools to manipulate and store “big” data and apply complex algorithms to this data have matured greatly in recent years. However, the final step in any successful machine learning project is to put the models into production with exposed APIs as well as monitor, scale and continuously update them. Kubernetes offers the ideal platform to build an ML deployment platform. This talk will review some of the challenges in deploying machine learning models and discuss Kubernetes focused open source projects (Seldon Core, KubeFlow) that provide solutions.\n\nAbout Clive\nClive is the CTO at Seldon. He has a research background in Computational Linguistics and studied Speech & Language Processing at Cambridge University. Clive has spent the last few years developing Seldon’s algorithms and predictive platform and working on various machine learning projects in industry."
