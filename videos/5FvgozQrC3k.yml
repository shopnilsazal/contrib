description: "Good Vibrations: Hacking Motion Sickness on the Cheap\nTottenkoph consultant, crypto-fiend, hacker, and awesome chix0r\n\nMotion sickness has been an issue since man learned how to travel by means other than by foot, with the earliest recorded cases dating back to ancient Greece.\n\nAlthough the problem has existed for such a long time, there has been no documented case of a cure for all forms and severities of motion sickness and the most common way to relieve people of the symptoms that go along with motion sickness involve taking drugs. In this presentation, Tottenkoph will give an overview of what causes motion sickness as well as introduce a set of devices that will help lessen the severity of the symptoms that can be made easily.\n\nTottenkoph: consultant, crypto-fiend, hacker, and awesome chix0r. She started with hardware modding and PC repair stuff until the wonderful world of cryptography and open networks was stumbled upon. Tottenkoph is currently doing school and projects full time.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
