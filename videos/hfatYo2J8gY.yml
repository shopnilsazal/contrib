description: "We built a map to aggregate real-time flood data in under two days! by Aruna Sankaranarayanan\n\nDuring the 2015 floods in Chennai, India, a few of us built an application that could crowd-source real-time flood data. It was used widely by at least 600,000 people in Chennai and went on to become a beautiful civic visualisation. Iâ€™ll talk about the exact workflow and tools we used to build this map, and you will take away an understanding of the libraries you can use to create your own map-driven projects."
