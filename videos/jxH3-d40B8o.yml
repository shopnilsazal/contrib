description: "The 90s Riot Grrrl movement was about being loud and giving other women space to be loud. It was about creating zines and music and community as an outlet for issues women faced- many of which still prevail today. This talk applies the Riot Grrrl Manifesto to the tech industry. It looks at how the challenges of women in punk parallel to what women face in the tech industry, as well as what riot girl can teach us about being loud and unapologetic in tech. Weâ€™ll also investigate where the movement left off and where we can go from there.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HG6O/"
