description: "From Heroku to Cloud Native in 7 Weeks [B] - Ivan Pedrazas, Soho House\n\nAt Soho House we went from Heroku to be fully cloud native in only 7 weeks by choosing the right technologies: Kubernetes, Prometheus and Fluentd, and the right tools: Helm, drone.io, Kubernetes Third Party Resources and Nats.\n\nDuring this talk we will see how a small team of developers managed to migrate their Heroku infrastructure to a multi cloud environment.\n\nWe will cover how the CI/CD based on Helm was built and the problems around building and deploying cloud native applications. We will explain how using Third Party resources and nats.io enabled a group of ruby developers to be fully productive with a kubernetes cluster by abstracting the hard bits.\n\nWe will cover how to build a production ready cluster using Prometheus and Fluentd allowed us to focus on what was important for Soho House: building a platform to deliver solutions quickly and without breaking the bank.\n\nIn summary, this is the story of a journey from zero to production using cloud native technologies.\n\nAbout Ivan Pedrazas\nIvan has a background in development and architecture. He has been helping companies to adopt Kubernetes and release better software and more often. He enjoys designing and building distributed systems. | | Ivan also co-hosts Kubecast, the Kubernetes podcast and, co-organises the Kubernetes London meetup."
