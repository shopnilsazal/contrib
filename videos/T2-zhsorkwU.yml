description: "Defeating SEAndroid \nPAU OLIVA FORA SR. MOBILE SECURITY ENGINEER, VIAFORENSICS\n\nSecurity Enhancements for Android (SEAndroid) enables the use of SELinux in Android in order to limit the damage that can be done by malicious apps, trying to make exploitation harder. Some OEMs are trying hard to implement extra mitigations in their devices, especially those aiming to reach the enterprise market. We will present some issues that are found in devices currently implementing SEAndroid, and demonstrate how vendors FAIL in properly implementing SEAndroid protection.\n\nPau Oliva (@pof) is a Mobile Security Engineer with viaForensics. He has previously worked as R+D Engineer in a Wireless Provider. His passion for smartphones started back in 2004 when he had his first PocketPC phone with the Windows Mobile operating system and started reverse engineering and hacking HTC devices. He has been actively researching security aspects on the Android operating system since its debut with the T-Mobile G1 on October 2008. Pau is co-author of Wiley's Android Hacker's Handbook.\n\nMaterials: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Fora/DEFCON-21-Fora-Defeating-SEAndroid.pdf"
