They are not, and therefore there is a Kubernetes-style API in your future--come learn what it will look like.\n\nAbout Daniel\nCurrently TL of Kubernetes’ API Machinery sub-team, Daniel has been working on Kubernetes since before it was open sourced, and contributed enough in the early days that he’s still one of the top contributors overall.
