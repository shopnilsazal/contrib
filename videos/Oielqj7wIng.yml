description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nResource Management WG Deep Dive – Vishnu Kannan, Google (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nThis session provides a deep dive into the features and technologies that the Kubernetes Resource Management Working Group has been working on recently. Specifically, this would include support for hardware devices like GPUs, improved performance via smarter CPU and Memory management, and overall compute resource extensibility. You will benefit from this session if you care about performance and performance sensitive workloads like Machine Learning.\n\nAbout Vishnu\nVishnu Kannan is a Senior Software Engineer at Google. Vishnu received his Masters in ECE from Georgia Tech. He has been a systems engineer ever since he graduated. He hacked on the Linux Kernel for a couple of years at Cisco. He then worked on Borg at Google. He is currently an active maintainer in the Kubernetes community focussing on managing compute resources at scale."
