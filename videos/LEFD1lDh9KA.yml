title: 'DEF CON 16 - Panel: All Your Sploits (and Servers) Are Belong To Us'

description: "DEF CON 16 - Panel: All Your Sploits (and Servers) Are Belong To Us: Vulnerabilities Don't Matter (And Neither Does Your Security)\nThink that latest buffer overflow or XSS exploit matters? It doesn't. Think your network is secure because you have the latest and greatest IPS? It isn't. The truth is all exploits or defenses on their own are worthless; it's how you use your tools and respond to incidents that really matters. This panel, composed of top vulnerability and security researchers, will roll through a rapid-fire series of demonstrations as they smash through the security of popular consumer and enterprise devices and systems, often using simple techniques rather than the latest 0day exploits (but we'll see a few of those too). They'll then debate the value of any single attack vector or defense, and show how it's the practical application of attacks, defenses, and (more importantly) responses that really matters. From iPhones to browsers to SCADA, it isn't your advanced attack or defensive tool that matters, it's what you do with it.\n\nAs CSO-in-Residence, David Mortman is responsible for Echelon One's research and analysis program.
