title: 'DEF CON 23 - Ionut Popescu - NetRipper: Smart Traffic Sniffing for Penetration Testers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450307009
description: "The post-exploitation activities in a penetration test can be challenging if the tester has low-privileges on a fully patched, well configured Windows machine. This work presents a technique for helping the tester to find useful information by sniffing network traffic of the applications on the compromised machine, despite his low-privileged rights. Furthermore, the encrypted traffic is also captured before being sent to the encryption layer, thus all traffic (clear-text and encrypted) can be sniffed. The implementation of this technique is a tool called NetRipper which uses API hooking to do the actions mentioned above and which has been especially designed to be used in penetration tests, but the concept can also be used to monitor network traffic of employees or to analyze a malicious application.\n\nSpeaker Bio\nIonut works as a Senior Security Consultant at KPMG in Romania.
