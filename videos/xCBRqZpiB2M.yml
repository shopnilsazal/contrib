description: "The Joy of Miniature Painting by Caleb Thompson\n\nAs developers, we often stare at a computer screen all day only to come home and stare at more glowing boxes all night. Having a productive, nontechnical hobby can really help to keep us sharp for our day jobs.\n\nYou'll watch me live-paint a small model for a game called Warmachine while I describe some of the techniques I use. You'll hear about how painting has helped me to clear my mind after work, keeping me away from burnout I might encounter if I wasn't exercising a different brain lobe.\n\nAfterward, I'd love to chat about painting and playing games.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H1gm/"
