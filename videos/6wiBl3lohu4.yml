Game of Hacks, built using the node.js framework, displays a range of vulnerable code snippets challenging the player to locate the vulnerability. A multiplayer option makes the challenge even more attractive and the leaderboard spices up things when players compete for a seat on the iron throne.\n\nWithin 24 hours we had 35K players test their hacking skills...we weren't surprised when users started breaking the rules. Join us to:\n\nPlay GoH against the audience in real time and get your claim for fame \nUnderstand how vulnerabilities were planted within Game of Hacks \nSee real attack techniques (some caught us off guard) and how we handled them \nLearn how to avoid vulnerabilities in your code and how to go about designing a secure application \nHear what to watch out for on the ultra-popular node.js framework. \nCheck it out at www.Gameofhacks.com\n\nAmit Ashbel joined Checkmarx From Trusteer (acquired by IBM). He has been with the security community for more than a decade where he has taken on multiple tasks and responsibilities over the years, including technical and Senior Product lead positions.\n\nAmit adds valuable product knowledge including experience with a wide range of security platforms and familiarity with emerging threats and the hi-tech security industry.\n\nMaty is the CTO and founder of Checkmarx. Maty has more than a decade of experience in software development, IT security and source-code analysis. Prior to founding Checkmarx, Maty worked for two years at the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office as a senior IT security expert and project manager.
