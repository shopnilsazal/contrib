title: 'Reaktor Breakpoint 2018: Nicholas Kariniemi, JavaScript, TypeScript and PureScript'
recordingDate: 1528981191
description: "Topic for the talk:\nJavaScript and self-deception: why TypeScript is not enough\n\nJavaScript is often derided for callback hell and for quirks around equality, number handling, type coercions and the \"this\" keyword. This is largely a straw man argument. Developers work around these shortcomings through conventions, tools, and libraries and problems caused by these kinds of quirks come up infrequently. This talk instead aims to explore the best ways that I know how to write JavaScript- using good conventions, using functional libraries, using types, using promises and immutable data- and motivate PureScript as a way of pushing the limits and bringing development in the JavaScript ecosystem to the next level.\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018. For more information, check reaktorbreakpoint.com. \n\n---\n\nNicholas Kariniemi\nFunctional Programmer, Reaktor\n\nNicholas develops software at Reaktor, typically by talking with humans, applying functional programming ideas, and seeking short feedback cycles. He has spent some time building web applications for large media companies such as HBO, mining companies, and diabetes startups, among others. His love affair with PureScript is born out of deep experience in JavaScript across various incarnations."
