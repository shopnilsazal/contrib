description: "Over the past few years, we have seen the success of great web applications. As we strive to provide better user experiences we are continuously pushing the bar, unfortunately sometimes at the cost of productivity, maintainability and most importantly happiness.\n\nWhen products slow or fail under the pain of un-managed technical debt, everyone loses.\n\nThis talk showcases how ember helps manage this complexity today, where it falls shorts, and most importantly we will explore what the future of ember may look like.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2B/"
