recordingDate: 1491874400
description: "Go + Microservices = Go Kit [I] - Peter Bourgon, Go Kit\n\nGo is emerging as the default programming language for cloud-native tooling and infrastructure. But it's also a perfect language for implementing your business logic—with a little bit of help! This talk introduces and deep-dives into Go kit, an independent open-source toolkit for writing microservices in Go. We first identify the defining characteristics and challenges of working in a cloud-native architecture, and then build a production-grade, highly idiomatic Go kit microservice to address all of the concerns. Special attention is paid to instrumenting with Prometheus, log storage with Fluentd, distributed tracing with OpenTracing, and deploying via Kubernetes — all of which work out-of-the-box.\n\nAbout Peter Bourgon\nPeter Bourgon is a distributed systems engineer who has seen things. He is the author of Go kit, a toolkit for writing business microservices in Go."
