description: "Michael Davis, The Open-Source Security Myth and How to Make It A Reality\nOpen Source software is frequently described as more secure, than closed source software for two reasons: the number of people available to correct a problem is potentially larger; and anyone can review the source code for vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\nUnfortunately, the current state of design documentation does not support a cost-effective security review. In addition to compromising the confidence in the software, the lack of documentation also sets an unnecessarily high bar, for new members to join an Open Source projects. This unintended consequence directly reduces the number of people available to correct vulnerabilities or otherwise improve the software. The presentation provides a rationale for creating development documentation and identifies available tools. \n\nMichael Davis oversees the Security Engineering services provided by Dynamic Security Concepts, Incorporated (DSCI). During recent efforts to encourage his customers to use Open Source solutions; he oversaw the security review of a number of Open Source security tools. He possesses a broad security background and has been a featured speaker for select audiences on the subject of intrusion detection and evaluating security solutions in general."
