title: '#HITB2018AMS Welcome Address: Improving Incentives for Cybersecurity - Michel van Eeten'
recordingDate: 1524466037
description: "Security failures are caused by bad incentives, at least as often as by bad design. How can we fix the incentives? This is the economic approach to cybersecurity. Using large-scale incident and vulnerability data, we can discuss ways in which incentives can be improved in the fight against all kinds of threats: web compromise, malicious hosting, botnets, compromised IoT, IP spoofing.\n\n=== \n\nMichel van Eeten is professor of cybersecurity at Delft University of Technology. He studies the interplay between technological design and economic incentives in Internet security. His team analyses large-scale Internet measurement and incident data to identify how the markets for Internet services deal with security risks. He has conducted empirical studies for the ITU, OECD, European Commission and the Dutch government on the economics of malware, the impact of cybercrime and the role of ISPs in mitigating botnets and bad hosting. He is also a member of the Dutch Cyber Security Council."
