description: "Delivering Services at DigitalOcean - Mac Browning, DigitalOcean\n\n\"Though kubernetes itself provides a rich collection of resources to deploy services it also comes with a bundle of complexity. This is where DOCC (DigitalOcean Control Center) comes in. This talk will explore how the DOCC abstraction simplifies the user's interface with kubernetes and how its opinionated design allows developers to focus on their services. By building DigitalOceanâ€™s best practices into the platform, it promotes use of existing internal tools like centralized logging, dashboards, metrics, and alerting while keeping the user interface as minimal as possible. All of which is written and maintained by a small team of engineers empowered by the kubernetes API and the flexibility it offers.\n\nThis talk will cover some of the decisions the team faced and solutions to problems when marrying an existing infrastructure with kubernetes. This talk will dive in and share examples of how using code instead of convention promotes a healthier service lifecycle and helps to remove complexity. This talk will share the team's experience when building on top of the kubernetes API and what it helped the team accomplish.\"\n\nAbout Mac Browning\nI'm a senior software engineer and technical lead at DigitalOcean where I've been for 2.5 years. I've worked on nearly every piece of our stack ranging from the public API to datacenter provisioning tooling. After experiencing the high time to market caused by poor deployment tooling, I pitched the idea for the Delivery Engineering team to build internal tooling to enable delivery of the products we want quickly.\n\nSince then the team has grown from myself and one other engineer to 5 full time engineers. After evaluating a few options we built our tooling on top of kubernetes because it gave us the most useful features out of the box. We currently manage multiple kubernetes clusters within many datacenters spread over 3 continents all of which support varying types of applications and services.\n\nMy previous speaking experience has been at public meetups hosted by DigitalOcean:\nhttps://youtu.be/LUgE-sM5L4A\nhttps://youtu.be/zyB185IOrz8?t=28m47s\""
