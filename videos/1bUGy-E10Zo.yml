description: "Rails makes it very easy to rapidly develop web applications, but doesn't always make it so simple to deploy or secure them.\n\nThis talk is going to focus on best practices to secure your rails application, learnt through multiple high profile projects and penetration tests. The talk will be practical and show that this isn't necessarily hard if thought about from the start.\n\nWe'll also touch on getting the right balance of security without it getting in the way of the users.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGis/"
