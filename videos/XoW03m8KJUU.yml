description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS:\nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/materials/ \n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\n\nCome hear the history behind Megaupload, plus insight into Mega API and the 'new Mega' -- why, how and most importantly, when.\n\nABOUT EMMANUEL GADAIX\n\nEmmanuel started working in the mobile telecommunications industry in the early 90â€²s while following an advanced late-night curriculum in in-band signalling. Distressed by the apparent death of phreaking due to the introduction of the SS7 out-of-band signalling, he embarked on a decade-long quest to return this early form of telephone hacking to its former glory. In 2001 he presented the first-ever public speech about GSM security at the Black Hat briefings in Hong Kong and Singapore, followed by a streams of other presentations on that topic at major security events across Europe and Asia. In 2002 co-founded TSTF with Philippe Langlois to conduct security research on telecommunications systems and assisting mobile operators in securing their infrastructure, a Sisyphean effort in the complex and ever-changing world of mobile telecom carriers. Emmanuel has been based in Asia for almost 20 years and owns a Siamese kitten called Socket."
