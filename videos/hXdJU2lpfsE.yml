description: "6 degrees of JavaScript on Rails by Michael Crismali\n\nHow much JavaScript you include in your Rails application can feel like a choice between basically none or a full JavaScript single page application backed by a Rails API. When you have a team of people whose confidence with JavaScript is all over the place, this can feel like an impossible choice. Fortunately, there are many options in the middle that can allow those with less JavaScript confidence to stretch and grow while those with more confidence can build UI components with fewer constraints."
