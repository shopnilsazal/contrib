description: "Managing Machine Learning Projects in Industry: \nAs the use of machine learning techniques to analyze and find value in ‘big data’ is being adopted more broadly by industry, we see an increasing need to build teams that can execute on large and complex projects. It is not possible for a single machine learning expert to cover problems of the scope and magnitude that are encountered. The scale of these projects requires teams of researchers and engineers to coordinate and collaborate to deliver impact. In this talk I will touch on some learnings and considerations when building or expanding such a team. I will cover building a group, framing the problem, finding a solution, and evaluating the results. I will illustrate the points with examples drawn from my experience in large companies and startups. I hope to provoke consideration and discussion for the challenges in this area, as well as to illustrate some of the complexities."
