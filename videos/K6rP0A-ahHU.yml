description: "2000 Nodes and Beyond: How We Scaled Kubernetes to 60,000-Container Clusters and Where We're Going Next - Marek Grabowski, Google\n\n“Kubernetes supports 2000-Node clusters” - that statement was a part of the Kubernetes 1.3 release announcement. That’s great, but what exactly does it mean? During this talk I will explain what work we did to scale Kubernetes from 100 nodes in the 1.0 release to 2000 nodes, and describe the low-cost measurement infrastructure we’ve built to continuously measure Kubernetes performance at different cluster sizes. I’ll also talk a bit about our current work and plans for the future.\n\nAbout Marek Grabowski\nMarek is a Software Engineer working on Google’s Technical Infrastructure since 2013. He works on Kubernetes since February 2015, focusing mainly on scalability and machine management. Before that he was working on Omega project, doubling as an SRE for some clusters. Before his life at Google he attended University of Warsaw majoring in both Mathematics and Computer Science, and for a few years he was teaching at the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics in Warsaw."
