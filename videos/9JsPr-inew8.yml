description: "Anthony Chu\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2016/netfringe/sfcxpq/\n\"Docker is awesome and there's been a lot of excitement over .NET Core running in Linux containers. But why do older apps have to miss out on the fun? With Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server containers, there's finally a way to dockerize .NET 4.6 apps using the same Docker tools and commands as their Linux counterparts.\n\nIn this intermediate level talk, I'll give an overview of Docker and Windows Server containers. Then I'll demonstrate different ways to run existing ASP.NET Web API, MVC, and even WebForms applications inside Docker containers.\""
