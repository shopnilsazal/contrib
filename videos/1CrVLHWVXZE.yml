description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\nThursday, September 18 • 3:00pm - 3:45pm\n\nNot Go Quietly: Adaptive Strategies and Unlikely Teammates\n\nDon’t be a hero; assemble your team of avengers from unlikely allies. Nearly every aspect of our job as defenders has gotten more difficult and more complex—escalating threat, massive IT change, burdensome compliance reporting, all with stagnant security budgets and headcount. Rather than surrender, it’s time to fight back. This session will provide new approaches to finding financial and operational support for information security across the organization. Together we will highlight actual success stories and soft skills that make all the difference.\n\nSpeaker\n\nJoshua Corman\nCTO, Sonatype\nJoshua Corman is the Chief Technology Officer for Sonatype.
