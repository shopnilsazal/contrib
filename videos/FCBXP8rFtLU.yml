recordingDate: 1383380736
description: "Eric Fulton - Cellular Privacy: A Forensic Analysis of Android Network Traffic\n\n\nPeople inherently trust their phones, but should they? \"Cellular Privacy: A Forensic Analysis of Android Network Traffic\" is a presentation of results from forensically analyzing the network traffic of an Android phone. The results paint an interesting picture. Is Google more trustworthy than the application developers? Are legitimate market apps more trustworthy than their rooted counterparts? Perhaps most importantly, should you trust your passwords, location, and data to a device that shares too much?\n\nEric Fulton is the Director of Research for Lake Missoula Group, LLC, and a specialist in network penetration testing and web application assessments . In his spare time Eric works with local University students to provide hands-on security training, and conducts independent security research. Eric also publishes network forensics contests on ForensicsContest.com"
