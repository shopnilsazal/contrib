description: "By Prem Sichanugrist & Ryan Twomey\n\nWhen you're building a payment platform, you want to make sure that your system is always available to accept orders. However, the complexity of the platform introduces the potential for it to go down when any one of the moving parts fails. In this talk, I will show you the approaches that we've taken and the risks that we have to take to ensure that our platform will always be available for our customers. Even if you're not building a payment platform, these approaches can be applied to ensure a high availability for your platform or service as well.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGaR/"
