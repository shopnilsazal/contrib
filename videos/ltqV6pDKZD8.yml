description: 'We talk about "Idiomatic Go" a lot, but TBH it''s hard to define exactly what idiomatic Go actually is, but we know it when we see it. In this talk I''ll explore Go code containing a bunch of anti-patterns to see why they aren''t idiomatic, should be avoided and how to refactor your way out of them.'
