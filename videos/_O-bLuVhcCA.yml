description: "pg2 and You: Getting Distributed with Elixir by Eric Entin\n\nErlang's pg2 module provides distributed process groups and is a key technology underlying Phoenix's default PubSub adapter, which powers the Channels API that we know and love. Together, we'll take a guided tour of pg2's capabilities and see how easy it is to add distributed features to your own applications. Along the way, we'll dissect pg2's internals to see how the surprisingly short Erlang implementation can be accomplished in Elixir, while uncovering other primitives that make distributed Erlang so powerful. It's time to learn just how easy it is to tap into everything distributed Elixir has to offer!"
