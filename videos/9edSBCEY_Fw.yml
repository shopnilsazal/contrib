description: "At Cloudflare we deal with DDoS attacks every day. Over the years, we've gained a lot of experience in defending from all different kinds of threats. We have found that the largest attacks that cause the internet infrastructure to burn are only possible due to IP spoofing.\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss what we learned about the L3 (Layer 3 OSI stack) IP spoofing. We'll explain why L3 attacks are even possible in today's internet and what direct and reflected L3 attacks look like. We'll describe our attempts to trace the IP spoofing and why attack attribution is so hard. Our architecture allows us to perform most attack mitigations in software. We'll explain a couple of effective L3 mitigation techniques we've developed to stop our servers burning.\n\nWhile L3 attacks are a real danger to the internet, they don't need to be. With a bit of cooperation and couple of technical tricks maybe we can fix the IP spoofing problem for all."
