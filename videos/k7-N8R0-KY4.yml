You can find them here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84\n\nRecursion is when a function calls itself until it doesn't.\nThat is seriously all recursion is. It's really simple. A lot of people think that recursion is hard. The reason people think that recursion is hard is because all explanations of recursion use fibonacci numbers as an example, which is the worst example ever. If somebody tries to explain recursion to you using fibonnaci numbers, you must murder them. I understand that sounds rough, because they mean well, but\nwe really need to get rid of that, because it makes everyone think that recursion is hard, when it is actually easy."
