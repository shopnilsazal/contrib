title: 'Neuman Vong: The circuit as a point-free general model of computation'
recordingDate: 1354206626
description: "Discover how to create shorter simpler programs by modeling them as a circuit of intercommunicating processes.\n\nModern web applications and libraries have to maintain state, coordinate asynchronous events, and recover from failure. Over the course of development, the complexity of a program's control flow graph can vary greatly from one program to another; in a disorganized program, complexity can quickly grow making the program brittle and difficult to maintain. Inspired by category theory, point-free, and functional reactive programming, this talk will present some ideas on how to describe a program as a circuit, and why it could help to minimize complexity over the program's development.\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
