description: "Rewriting Rack: A Functional Approach by Alex Wheeler\n\nWhat if we traded in our classes for procs, our methods for functions, and took advantage of functional programming to rewrite Ruby's Rack? I kept hearing about the benefits of functional programming (simplicity, immutability, thread safety), but it wasn't until I reimplemented familiar Ruby concepts in a functional language that I really got it. In this talk, we'll steal some powerful FP ideas from Clojure and use them to rewrite Rack. You'll come out of it understanding how to write functional Ruby code that is simpler to reason about, less likely to break, and dead simple to debug."
