description: "QtPass and opensource project management The road from a 2 day project till inclusion in all distro's\nby Anne Jan Brouwer\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThis talk focusses on how QtPass went from a 2 evening necessity project toget management in on using a group password manager, to a full fledged projectwith over 40 contributors that is available on all linux distributions andOSs.\n\nWorking at a full service internet bureau I was shocked to see their way ofstoring credentials. The most shocking thing was that this seemed to bedefacto industry standard behaviour.\n\nA solution for the developers was soon found in pass, the standard UNIXpassword manager.\n\nUnfortunately management in unable (or rather unwilling) to use CLI tools. Soin two evenings I wrote a quick graphical read-only password viewer that usedpass to allow management to view passwords. As an added bonus, all internalmails between developers and management were now instantly encrypted aswel.\n\nI put it on github, under a group label, did a little hackathon to have peoplehelp me translate it to some languages and thought that was it.\n\nBut this was only the start of my adventures into opensource projectmanagement.\n\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 13:20:00"
