description: "Who Owns This Stream of Data? by Alex Beingessner\n\nRust exposes a lot of ways to traverse a collection: iter, iter_mut, into_iter, and drain to name a few! This isn't a case of over-engineering: each of these kinds of iterator necessarily falls out of Rust caring about ownership, and encoding it in the type system. However even all these iterators still aren't enough to capture all the subtleties of ownership and traversal!\n\nThis talk surveys the advantages, weaknesses, and motivation of the current iterator APIs, as well as hypothetical future iterator APIs that could complete our iteration story such as Cursor and MutexIterator.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Gx0p/"
