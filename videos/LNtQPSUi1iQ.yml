title: 'Brandon Bloom - Building CircleCI''s Front end With Om'
recordingDate: 1429579256
description: 'CircleCI''s frontend is a large, production-caliber, open-source Om project. CircleCI has long enjoyed the benefits of Clojure to power our CI platform, so we jumped at the opportunity to be ClojureScript + Om pioneers as well. Om represents both a significant step forward in UI development and considerable new opportunities for improvements. This talk will explore the benefits and challenges we''ve encountered, as well as provide a roadmap for using Om in your own projects.'
