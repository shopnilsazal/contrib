title: 'Dirk Gorissen - Measuring and Predicting Departures from Routine in Human Mobility'

Developing the science to describe and predict how people move from one place to another during their daily lives promises to address a wide range of societal challenges: from predicting the spread of infectious diseases, improving urban planning, to devising effective emergency response strategies. This presentation will discuss a Bayesian framework to analyse an individual's mobility patterns and identify departures from routine. It is able to detect both spatial and temporal departures from routine based on heterogeneous sensor data (GPS, Cell Tower, social media, ..) and outperforms existing state-of-the-art predictors. Applications include mobile digital assistants (e.g., Google Now), mobile advertising (e.g., LivingSocial), and crowdsourcing physical tasks (e.g., TaskRabbit)."
