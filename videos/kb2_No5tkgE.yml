description: "\"Lessons learned in X years of parallel programming\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - Anfiteatro 2]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nThere is a lot more to parallel programming in Python than\nmultiprocessing.Pool().map. In this talk I will share some\nhard-learned knowledge gained in several years of parallel\nprogramming. Covered topics will include performance, ways to measure\nthe performance, memory occupation, data transfer and ways to reduce\nthe data transfer, how to debug parallel programs and useful\nlibraries. I will give some practical examples, both in enterprise\nprogramming (importing CSV files in a database) and in scientific\nprogramming (numerical simulations). The initial part of the talk\nwill be pedagogical, advocating the convenience of parallel programming\nin the small (i.e. in single machine environment); the second part will\nbe more advanced and will touch a few things to know when writing\nparallel programs for medium-sized clusters.\nI will also briefly discuss the compatibility layer that we have developed at GEM\nto be independent from the underlying parallelization technology (multiprocessing,\nconcurrent.futures, celery, ipyparallel, grid engine...).\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
