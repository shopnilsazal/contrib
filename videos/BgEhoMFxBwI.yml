title: '#HITB2017AMS D1T1 - A New RISC - Don Bailey'
recordingDate: 1494406956
description: "In this lecture, Mr. Bailey will present the security attributes of an  exciting new processing architecture, RISC-V. Pronounced “Risk Five”, this  architecture offers exceptional opportunities for a new generation of  computing platforms by providing a fully open source Instruction Set  Architecture (ISA) to the professional community. This move substantially decreases the cost of building new processing units by removing the price  boundary often seen in common computing architectures.\n\nRISC-V is designed to be 32, 64, and 128-bit ready, allowing the architecture to be capable of spawning computing platforms from micro-controllers similar to the cortex-m0+ all the way to competitive next-generation mainframe architectures. RISC-V incorporates a layered privilege model by design that  offers the potential to secure even small embedded platforms in novel ways.\n\nThis talk is not just another “how to hack apps on architecture X” talk. While Mr. Bailey will present attacks against the RV32G ABI and the RV32C ABI, and will demonstrate exploitation capabilities with code examples, there is far  more to discuss in the context of RISC-V’s security model.\n\nDon will illuminate the base RISC-V privilege model as defined in the  specifications, and how various implementations, including the SiFive FE310G, handle privilege. He will continue by describing how other implementations  either do (or intend to) augment operating system security by providing  capabilities such as tagged memory.\n\nBailey will wrap up the security portion of the discussion by describing  features of the architecture that may be susceptible to manipulation through common faults observed in errata. He will compare issues in other common RISC architectures to those that are likely to be observed in RISC-V. He will then discuss the impact of defining an architecture across multiple native bit-lengths, and the security problems that are likely to arise once 128-bit processors are available to general computing.\n\nMr. Bailey will close the discussion with a commentary on the history of  computing architectures, their benefits, their weaknesses, and where RISC-V implementations need to go in order to improve security in general computing, and especially the Internet of Things ecosystem.\n\n=== \n\nDon A. Bailey loves his baby boy Pierce, tacos, and IoT.\n\nHe is an internationally respected security researcher known for breaking ground in the mobile and embedded security spaces. Don has given over thirty unique lectures on various advances in security technology over the last eight years, both around the world and within the United States. His research has been highlighted on news exchanges such as CNN, Reuters, NPR, BBC, FOX, and CBS. Don was recently featured in the IEEE Security & Privacy magazine for his recent work reverse engineering M2M systems such as vehicle security modules. Previously the Research Director for a prestigious security firm, Mr. Bailey recently founded the consulting and engineering organization Capitol Hill Consultants LLC. At CHC, Don focuses on government contracting, global defense-centric engagements, and mobile security consulting."
