description: "Future Perfect: A Text Adventure Game for our Failed Ideals\n\nI'm creating a sci-fi text adventure game based on \"the past's idea of the future\", and the ways technology has failed us. I'm focusing specifically on the experiences of women, people suffering from anxiety and depression, and the lower class. This game is partially inspired by my experience as a first generation immigrant in Silicon Valley, and partially by my love of old school sci-fi aesthetics and ideas.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HG4C/"
