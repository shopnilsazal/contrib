description: "Max-kernel search: How to search for just about anything?\n\nNearest neighbor search is a well studied and widely used task in computer science and is quite pervasive in everyday applications. While search is not synonymous with learning, search is a crucial tool for the most nonparametric form of learning. Nearest neighbor search can directly be used for all kinds of learning tasks — classification, regression, density estimation, outlier detection. Search is also the computational bottleneck in various other learning tasks such as clustering and dimensionality reduction. Key to nearest neighbor search is the notion of “near”-ness or similarity. Mercer kernels form a class of general nonlinear similarity functions and are widely used in machine learning. They can define a notion of similarity between pairs of objects of any arbitrary type and have been successfully applied to a wide variety of object types — fixed-length data, images, text, time series, graphs. I will present a technique to do nearest neighbor search with this class of similarity functions provably efficiently, hence facilitating faster learning for larger data."
