description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by  Cketti.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-63\n\nMany apps do unexpected things when a user rotates the device. A message that has been painfully composed using the on-screen keyboard is just gone. Dialogs are disappearing. Data that took a while to load and display is gone and now the app is making the user wait again.\n\nAll of this is very frustrating to users. But if you know that an Activity is destroyed and then recreated on orientation change, this is not too surprising to you. Still, many beginners don’t know what is going on behind the scenes and consequently come up with flawed or incomplete ways to deal with the lifetime of an Activity.\n\nIf you have ever “fixed” a bug by changing your app’s manifest to manually handle orientation changes or by locking the device orientation, this talk is for you. It aims to give attendees a better understanding of the Activity lifetime/lifecycle. And we will look at the fundamental ways to deal with this situation. So you can write better apps.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
