title: 'RailsConf 2014 - Authorization in a Service-Oriented Environment by Alan Cohen'
language: English
recordingDate: 1400082495
description: "In a SOA environment users can interact with multiple parts of your system, and the rules for authorization become dispersed across applications. The task of maintaining rules becomes complex. The challenge compounds further in a heterogeneous environment, with services built in different languages. In this talk, I focus on the topic of authorization, specifically how we can scale and grow our services with confidence. I'll walk through a new framework we've developed to approach this problem.\n\nAlan Cohen is a Software Engineer at Climate Corporation working on the Insurance product back-end and other core pieces of their risk management platform.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0y/"
