Along the way, we'll look at the events and motivations that directed the growth of the program, as well as celebrate some of the more interesting and quirky bugs and individuals involved.\n\nMost excitingly, we'll end with results and updates from the previous day's exciting Pwnium 2 competition! There will be lots of time for audience questions.\n\nABOUT CHRIS EVANS\n\nChris is known for various work in the security community.
