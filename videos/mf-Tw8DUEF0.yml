description: "DEF CON 16 - FX: Developments in Cisco IOS Forensics\nAttacks on network infrastructure are not a new field. However, the increasing default protections in common operating systems, platforms and development environments increase interest in the less protected infrastructure sector. Today, performing in-depth crash analysis or digital forensics is almost impossible on the most widely used routing platform.\n\nThis talk will show new developments in this sector and how a slightly adjusted network infrastructure configuration together with new tools finally allows to separate crashed, attacked and backdoored routers from each other. We walk through the known types of backdoors and shellcodes for IOS as well as their detection and the challenges in doing so.\n\n\"FX\" Felix Lindner runs Recurity Labs. FX has over 10 years experience in the computer industry, eight of them in consulting for large enterprise and telecommunication customers. He possesses a vast knowledge of computer sciences, telecommunications and software development. His background includes managing and participating in a variety of projects with a special emphasis on security planning, implementation, operation and testing using advanced methods in diverse technical environments. FX is well known in the computer security community and has presented his and Phenoelit's security research on Black Hat Briefings, CanSecWest, PacSec, DEFCON, Chaos Communication Congress, MEITSEC and numerous other events. His research topics included Cisco IOS, HP printers, SAP and RIM BlackBerry. Felix holds a title as State-Certified Technical Assistant for Informatics and Information Technology as well as Certified Information Systems Security Professional. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
