description: "better tooling for building consistent servers. With the introduction of Packer this last year, it's become easier to automate the process of building consistent images. Thinking of images as compiled (immutable), configurable, runnable, containers opens up some interesting possibilities.\nIn this talk I'll be introducing the Immutable Pipeline, a process our team uses to ensure consistency between staging and production. I will also be covering ways we test our images before they move to production.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2b/"
