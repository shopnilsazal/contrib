description: "By Lluis Sahnchez Gual\r\n\r\nMonoDevelop is an open source IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.\r\n\r\nMonoDevelop enables developers to quickly write desktop and ASP.NET Web applications on Linux, Windows and Mac OSX. MonoDevelop makes it easy for developers to port .NET applications created with Visual Studio to Linux and to maintain a single code base for all platforms.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll show the features of the recently released MonoDevelop 2.2, and a sneak peak of what we are planning for the next release. It will be a practical session with examples of how to use and extend MonoDevelop.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
