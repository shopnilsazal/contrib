description: "by André Petermann\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nMining frequent itemsets is an established approach to data mining andsupported by productive data mining solutions. For example, one can getinsights about buyers’ behavior by analyzing frequent co-occurrences ofproducts in shopping baskets. In contrast, frequent subgraph mining (FSM), thegraphy variant of frequent itemset mining, not only evaluates entity co-occurrence but also relationships among entities, i.e., structural patterns.However, existing implementations are all research prototypes which aretailored to textbook problems.\n\nIn our talk, we want to give an introduction to the FSM problem on distributedcollections of graphs and our implementation in Gradoop, an open source systemfor scalable graph analytics based on Apache Flink. In contrast to otheriterative graph algorithms like page rank, in FSM the search space is droppedbut intermediate results of iterations are the desired result. Here, the majortechnical challenge is the respective usage of Flinks’ distributed iterations.\n\nWe will explain different implementation approaches, discuss implementationdetails which influence scalability and show benchmark results.\n\nIntended audience and goal of the talk: Developers and analysts, interested inrelationship-centric data mining techniques\n\nDesired length of your time slot: 30min\n\nLinks to background information on the given talk for the hungry andimpatient: http://www.gradoop.com http://flink.apache.org/\n\nLinks to your previous talks, code snippets or repositories: http://dbs.uni-leipzig.de/file/Graph _Mining_ for _Complex_ Data _Analytics.pdf GitHub:http://www.gradoop.com/ Graph Data Model: http://dbs.uni-leipzig.de/file/EPGM.pdf Fosdem 2016:https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/graph_ processing _gradoop_flink_analytics\n\n\nRoom: H.2214\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 13:30:00"
