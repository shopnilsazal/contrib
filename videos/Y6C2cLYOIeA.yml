description: "In this GDC 2015 talk, Double Fine Project lead Brad Muir walks through a case study of the bloodline system of Massive Chalice. How do you create a cohesive design when your characters are aging and passing away over the course of an epic timeline? This talk hits a variety of issues related to the timeline such as marriage, genetics, pregnancy, menopause and more. Learn how Double Fine tackled each of these aspects to develop a cohesive, streamlined system that lets players manage their heroes for several hundred years.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
