description: "What's in a price? How to price your products and services by Michael Herold\n\nSo you have something new to sell: maybe your first book or a hip new SaaS. How do you decide the price? How do you know you're not overpricing? Or underpricing? Why, oh why, did you ever think to sell something?!\n\nInstead of choosing a number by looking inward at your costs, you can use what programmers use best: an abstraction! You'll learn a model for picking the right price for your product and what that price communicates so you can confidently price your next great invention. You'll leave with an actionable list of next steps for pricing your future projects."
