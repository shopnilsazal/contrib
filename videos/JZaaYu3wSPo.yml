title: 'Farmhouse Conf 3 Fugitives Have More Fun: Confessions of a Wanted Eco-Terrorist by Peter Young'
recordingDate: 1366718091
description: "Convicted \"eco-terrorist\" and former fugitive tells his story — the whole story — for the first time.\n\nIn 1997, after Peter Young was charged with Animal Enterprise Terrorism for freeing thousands of mink from fur farms, he was faced with a decision: submit to the court and face a possible life sentence, or run for it.\n\nHe chose the second one.\n\nIn an attempt to live his life to the fullest before the government took it away, Young spent 8 years perfecting the art (and science) of living well as a wanted man. For years lawyers told him never to discuss his years as a fugitive, and he never has - until now. From freight trains to book tours, these are the stories of one man's attempts to live a lifetime of adventure before a possible lifetime in prison.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGco/"
