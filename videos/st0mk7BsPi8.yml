description: "Abstraction is a fundamental approach in programming. It shapes how we solve problems, it is a defining factor in how we view the internals of software and even the world surrounding it and us. The questions of when, how and what to abstract are some of the biggest in computer science and can make the difference between good and bad code. This talk is a fresh take on different facets of abstractions we encounter, build on and have to fight with.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGZK/"
