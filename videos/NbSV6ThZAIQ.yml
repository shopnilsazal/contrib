recordingDate: 1410803201
description: "I've sat through years and years of bad slides and bad presentations. Often times the speaker and/or the content of the presentation is totally awesome, but the slides are horrible. Bad slides are bad. Bad slides bore, distract and confuse your audience. Bad slides even crash space shuttles. Srsly.\n\nI'll enumerate a dozen ways that you can make your slides better for you, your audience and puppies. And space shuttles. We'll cover the good, the bad and the ugly. Names will be named. Punches will not be pulled.\n\nAnd yes, I'm talking about you.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FNkE/"
