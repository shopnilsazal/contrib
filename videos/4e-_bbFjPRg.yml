description: "RubyConf 2016 - Keyword Args — the killer Ruby feature you aren't using by  Guyren G. Howe\n\nWrite clearer code more easily. Write functions that are more composable and flexible.\n\nRuby 2.0's KWArgs feature isn't just an easier way to write functions that take keyword arguments; KWArgs turn Ruby into a lean, mean Hash processing machine.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn the details of how to write the next generation of Ruby code. Code that is easier to read, easier to write, more flexible and easier to change, all based on this one simple Ruby feature."
