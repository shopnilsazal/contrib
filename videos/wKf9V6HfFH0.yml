language: English
recordingDate: 1458662818
description: "There are no easy answers or shortcuts to changing a culture and increasing diversity, but we can do more than wait around and hope it happens naturally! Pixelles is a grassroots initiative founded in Montreal with the goal to increase the number of women making games, to great success thus far. The Pixelles initiative grew organically to be composed of two (equally free) halves: a mainstream-facing workshop series, and an industry-embedded personal mentorship program. In this 2014 talk, Tanya Short, a Pixelles co-founder, describes the steps they took to create both halves of the program, the lessons they learned, and the changes they see in gamer culture going forward.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
