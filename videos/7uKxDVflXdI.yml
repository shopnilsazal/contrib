description: "Snappiness is an important key for any successful webpage. Most companies try to achieve responsive webshops by scaling their hardware big time. But Rails in combination with Nginx, Memcached and Redis is the key to deliver webpages very fast with a minimal amount of hardware. This talk will start with the basics of DHH's russian doll idea but will raise the bar than quite a bit. How can we combine fragment caching, page caching and HTTP caching to deliver personalized webshop pages for logged in users? How much brain can be delegated to Redis or the Webbrowser? Harddrive space is cheap. So use it! You'll get to know how to plan your data structure and where to use Memcached vs. Redis. Include the cache in the beginning of your development and not in the end. To make things a bit more interesting everything is replayed on a Raspberry Pi to show how much difference intelligent caching can make on any hardware. Save big time and get more clients with a faster web application!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGaf/"
