description: "Description\nAI is making huge progress in the recent years. Everything started with deep learning techniques for image recognition and later, we've seen game-changing advances in learning to take actions (autonomous cars, Alpha Go engine, robots). Turns out basic problems like solving Rubik's cube can be solved in a few dozens of lines of code and described on one slide. Don't believe? Let me convince you.\n\nAbstract\nProblem introduction\nShow a Rubik's cube, describe why it isn't easy to solve it.\nShow my Python model of the cube and some traditional (non-AI) methods for solving it.\nThe concept of reinforcement learning (RL)\nMulti-armed bandit problem.\nIntroduce agent, environment, action, and reward.\nIntroduce Q-function.\nBasic algorithms for RL and their motivation\nREINFORCE algorithm.\nReward-Weighted regression.\nDeep learning algorithms.\nImplementing RL for Rubik's cube\nIntroduce libraries:\n\nTheano/Tensorflow\nKeras\nOpenai's RLLab and Gym.\nPresent 3 iterations of cube's solving and compare their learning rate and results.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
