description: "Baron Schwartz, VividCortex\n\nWe've all stared in frustration at a system that degraded into nonresponsiveness, to the point that you couldn't even kill-dash-nine whatever was responsible for the problem. A key fact we all recognize, but may not recognize as significant, is that this isn't a sharp boundary. There's a gradient of deteriorating performance where the system becomes less predictable and stable. In this talk I'll explain:\n\nwhat the unacceptable workload boundary is\nhow to recognize and predict the signs\nhow to measure and model this simply\nwhat causes nonlinear performance degradation\nhow to use this to architect more scalable systems\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
