title: 'Bang the gong, the game is on: What can Python people learn from Ruby? by Peter Lovett'
recordingDate: 1408244696
description: "What has Ruby got that Python people could learn from? Turns out quite a lot. \nRuby's a bit of a cross between Python and Perl, and borrows heavily from them both.\nWhat does Ruby do well that we can learn from, and also, what does Python do wonderfully? (Hint: a lot).\nThis presentation will give a quick overview of the major syntactic differences, an understanding of the (superior) object model (whose?), and a quick coverage of some of the Ruby standard library.\nIf you want a quick leg-up on Ruby vs Python, this quick tour will give that to you. And in doing so, will improve your appreciation for and understanding of Python.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nAugust 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
