description: "In this 2017 GDC session, Miami University professor Bob De Schutter draws from his own and third party research with older players to discuss the potential of VR technology as well as its usability and content challenges, in order to derive a set of practical design guidelines that challenge stereotypical views on the older audience of digital games.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
