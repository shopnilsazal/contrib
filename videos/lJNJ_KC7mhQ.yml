description: "Paula Sanz-Leon\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/33/view_talk\nThe Virtual Brain (TVB) is an open-source scientific software written in\r\nPython for advanced simulations of complex brain dynamics. TVB can be used in\r\na client-server configuration, such that its web-based interface can be\r\naccessed remotely, or as a standalone cross-platform Python library through a\r\nscripting interface. \r\n\r\nIn this talk I will begin by briefly explaining the motivations and science \r\nbehind TVB. This will be followed by a description of TVB's architecture and \r\nmain functionalities, including: simulation of neural activity; modification \r\nand visualization of brain connectivity and network dynamics; and, analysis \r\nof time-series. Lastly, I will show you that getting started with brain \r\nsimulations is just one Jupyter notebook away.\r\n\r\nWith TVB you might not be able to build smart brains (yet), but you can build\r\none of the most realistic approximations to the physics of a human brain."
