description: "Programming as a Performance by Joseph Wilk\n\nSince the inception of the programmable computer we have grappled with the challenge of validating the outcome of a conversation in code between a human and a machine. Programming as a performance embraces this challenge, putting it at the centre of a performance. Focusing on the liveliness and complexity of dancing with a machine in realtime. In a performance a human edits and writes algorithms, expressing their thoughts and composition in front of an audience. Binding to their fingertips control of light, sound and poetry. Sharing their screens and code and its effects on the world.\nThis talk will dive into the world of the live programmer and how you can turn your Ruby coding skills into a live performance. Discover what performance and expression has to teach us about programming.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GxS1/"
