description: "DEF CON 16 - JonM: Ham For Hackers- Take Back the Airwaves\nThink amateur radio is all about dorks with walkie talkies? Think again. Amateur radio presents one of the last bastions for open radio experimentation. This talk will provide a brief introduction to amateur radio, explain the advantages of licensed spectrum for experimentation, and describe how to get involved in the leading edge of radio hacking.\n\nJonM has been a licensed amateur radio operator for nearly a decade, but has never worn a radio on his belt. He holds an Amateur Extra license, the highest level granted in the US. When not mucking with the airwaves,he is a consultant specializing in application security. \n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 16 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-16-archive.html"
