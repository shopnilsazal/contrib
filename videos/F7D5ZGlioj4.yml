recordingDate: 1413830016
description: "As engineers working on a team, we all make technical decisions. What’s the best way to implement this? Where should this function live? Is this library worth using? Some decisions, though, are larger, riskier and more important than that. But generally, they’re also far less frequent.\n\nRight now, your team might be struggling to organize the client-side parts of your application. Ember? Angular? Backbone? Flip a coin? Uh…which one has the most…retweets? These choices don’t need to be arbitrary or based on vague personal preference. Come learn a more useful and realistic approach that makes large-scale technical decisions less risky.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/F0or/"
