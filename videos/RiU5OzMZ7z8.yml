description: "Quick, what do you get when you increment Math.pow(2, 53)? If you said Math.pow(2, 53), you may be a JavaScript programmer.\n\nFrom the beginning, JavaScript has supported 64-bit binary floats as its sole numeric type. In this talk, Iâ€™ll explain how, through TC39, JavaScript developers are working together with JS engine implementers and spec wonks like me to create BigInt: a native, unlimited-size integer type.\n\nThrough collaboration, any layer of software can be changed, even the language itself."
