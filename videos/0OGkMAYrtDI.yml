description: "Robert Clark: Computer and Internet Security Law. A Year in Review 2006&2007\n\nThis presentation reviews the important prosecutions, precedents and legal opinions of the last year that affect internet and computer security. We will discuss the differences between legal decisions from criminal cases and civil lawsuits and what that means to the security professional. Additionally, we look at topics such as: email retention and discovery; active response; use of CFAA as non-competition methods; identity theft and notification issues; legal aspects of emerging technologies; lawsuits involving IT corporations (Google, Yahoo, Apple, Microsoft); and of course, the NSA surveillance litigation. As always, this presentation is strongly audience driven and it quickly becomes an open forum for questions and debate.\n\nMr. Robert Clark is the principal point of contact in the Department of the Navy Secretariat and the Office of the General Counsel for legal issues regarding information management/information technology. As such he is responsible for advising on critical infrastructure protection; information assurance; FISMA; privacy; electronic government; identity management; spectrum management; records management; information collection; Open Source Software; and, infrastructure protection program both physical and cyber assets. Prior to this position Mr. Clark was the legal advisor on computer network operations to the Army Computer Emergency Response Team. Both these positions require coordination and consulting with the DoD Office of General Counsel, NSA, and DoJ Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section. He is a previous Black Hat lecturer and lectures at Def Con, the Army's Intelligence Law Conference and the DoD's Cybercrimes Conference."
