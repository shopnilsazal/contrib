description: "PyData DC 2016\n\nGithub: https://github.com/justmarkham/pydata-dc-2016-tutorial\n\nAlthough numeric data is easy to work with in Python, most knowledge created by humans is actually raw, unstructured text. By learning how to transform text into data that is usable by machine learning models, you drastically increase the amount of data that your models can learn from. In this tutorial, we'll build and evaluate predictive models from real-world text using scikit-learn."
