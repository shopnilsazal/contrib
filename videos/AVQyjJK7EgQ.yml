title: 'Whiz, Bang, ZAP! An introduction to OWASP''s Zed Attack Proxy - Ben Walther'
recordingDate: 1392407670
description: "The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is \"an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.\" The technology is comparable to IBM AppScan and HP WebInspect - but free, open source and maintained by OWASP volunteers. The project has seen a tremendous amount of development lately. Learn about the tool, what it can do for you, and optionally bring your laptop to follow along as we use it to test some (purposefully insecure) web applications. \n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
