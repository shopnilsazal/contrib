In one hour, you will understand how to take the full control of Internet Explorer 4.x and above and modify on-the-fly the content of any HTML page before it is rendered.\n\nGregoire Gentil, 30 years old, has been the founder of three software companies, the last one focusing on security for the untrusted computer (self-service computer in a cyber-cafe, home computer, ...). Gregoire Gentil has also been a consultant at McKinsey Company. He has audited highly complex IT architectures and organizations of banks, and has participated to the re-organization of the IT department of the #1 European insurance company.
