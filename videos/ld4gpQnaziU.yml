description: "Islamic Geometry: Hankin’s Polygons in Contact Algorithm!!! by Yomna Nasser\n\nIn this talk we will go over Hankin’s “Polygons in Contact” algorithm, a technique for generating common patterns encountered in Islamic geometry, and some variations on it. There will be an introduction to tiling theory, quite a few pretty pictures, and two (!!) interactive examples in JavaScript.\n\nWe’ll also briefly touch on the historical and cultural aspects of this kind of geometry!\n\nYomna likes collecting musical instruments, discrete mathematics, cooking, and cold, dark rooms. She is a Technology Fellow at the EFF, and can be contacted via Twitter."
