description: "by Karwai Pun\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nAt the Home Office, UK we designed a set of posters aiming to promoteaccessibility, raising awareness of various users and conditions through gooddesign practice. By sharing them openly with others, they've become somethingbetter, and have been made even more accessible along the way.\n\nWe'll be discussing how the posters started with an idea and by keeping themopen-source, have lead to lots of collaboration, engagement and feedback.We've had requests for translating the posters and learned some things alongthe way. We're also embarking on an exciting new project with these posterswhich will be elaborated on.\n\nKarwai Pun is an interaction designer at the Home Office, working on makingdigital public services more accessible.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 12:30:00"
