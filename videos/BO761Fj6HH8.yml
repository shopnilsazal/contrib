description: "Developers and architects are increasingly called upon to solve big problems, and we are able to draw on a world-class set of open source tools with which to solve them. Problems of scale are no longer consigned to the web’s largest companies, but are increasingly a part of ordinary enterprise development. At the risk of only a little hyperbole, we are all distributed systems engineers now.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll look at four distributed systems architectural patterns based on real-world systems that you can apply to solve the problems you will face in the next few years. We’ll look at the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture and develop a set of criteria for knowing when to apply each one. You will leave knowing how to work with the leading data storage, messaging, and computation tools of the day to solve the daunting problems of scale in your near future."
