description: "Thanks to analytics, we have more information about our games than ever before. But instead of empowering our designs, we can easily become paralyzed by the power of metrics. This is exactly what happened during the soft launch of Halfbrick's Bears vs. Art. In this talk from Jetpack Joyride & Fruit Ninja co-creator Luke Muscat at GDC 2015, he explains how, after stumbling with small iterative changes, the team adopted a new approach: rapidly disrupt all aspects of the game and test the results. With a new perspective, analytics gave us huge creative freedom to make bold, experimental changes to the game, and learn some surprising and counterintuitive lessons about our design.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
