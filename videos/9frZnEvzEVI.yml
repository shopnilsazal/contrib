description: "by Colin Charles\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nHaving spent more than the last decade being the main point of contact fordistributions shipping MySQL, then MariaDB Server, it's clear that workingwith distributions have many challenges. Licensing changes (when MySQL movedthe client libraries from LGPL to GPL with a FOSS Exception), ABI changes,speed (or lack thereof) of distribution releases/freezes, supporting thesoftware throughout the lifespan of the distribution, specific bugs due toplatforms, and a lot more will be discussed in this talk. Let's not forget thepolitics. How do we decide \"tiers\" of importance for distributions? As abonus, there will be a focus on how much effort it took to \"replace\" MySQLwith MariaDB.\n\nHaving spent more than the last decade being the main point of contact fordistributions shipping MySQL, then MariaDB Server, it's clear that workingwith distributions have many challenges.

Why are distribution statistics important to us? Dowe monitor your bugs system or do you have a better escalation to us? How dowe test to make sure things are going well before release. This and more willbe spoken about.\n\nAs an upstream project (package), we love nothing more than being availableeverywhere. But time and energy goes into making this is so as there arequirks in every distribution.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 16:30:00"
