recordingDate: 1438096642
description: "Go gives us powerful abstraction through interfaces with no bureaucracy. In my quest to find the right balance between pragmatism and abstraction, I have developed some useful patterns that leverage Go’s interfaces to make code modular, lean and clean.\n\nThis is a hands-on opinionated talk about software craftsmanship and sane abstraction techniques.
