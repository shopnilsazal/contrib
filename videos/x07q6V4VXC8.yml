description: "RailsConf 2017: Why Software Engineers Disagree About Everything by Haseeb Qureshi\n\nWhy are there are so many disagreements in software? Why don’t we all converge on the same beliefs or technologies? It might sound obvious that people shouldn't agree, but I want to convince you it’s weird that we don't. This talk will be a philosophical exploration of how knowledge converges within subcultures, as I explore this question through the worlds of software, online fraud, and poker."
