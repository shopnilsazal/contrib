recordingDate: 1432136803
description: "By, Caleb Thompson\nThe need to keep your personal information, sensitive or nonsensitive, secure from prying eyes isn't new, but recent events have brought it back into the public eye. In this workshop, we'll build and upload public keys, explore Git commit signing, and learn to sign others' PGP keys. If we have time, we'll exchange key fingerprints and show IDs, then discuss signing and verifying gems. You'll need a photo ID and your own computer for this workshop."
