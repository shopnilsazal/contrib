description: "Iwan Vosloo - Reahl: The Python-only web framework\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nReahl is a full-featured web framework with a twist: with Reahl you\nwrite a web application purely in Python. HTML, JavaScript, CSS and\nall those cumbersome web technologies (and a few other lower level\nconcerns) are hidden away from you. As far as web frameworks go this\nis truly a paradigm shift: away from the cobwebs of all the different\nweb technologies, template languages and low-level details -- towards\nbeing able to focus on the goals at hand instead, using a single\nlanguage.\n\nIn this talk I will give you a brief idea of what Reahl is all about:\nwhy it is worthwhile doing, how it works, where we are and what still\nneeds to be done. I hope to convince you that this is an important\ndirection for web frameworks, and of how unique Reahl is. Developing\nsuch an abstract framework is an ambitious goal. I'd like to convey\nthe message that what we have achieved so far, and the strategy\nlessons learnt along the way demonstrate this goal to be realistic and\npractical."
