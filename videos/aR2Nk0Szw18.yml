description: "by Tomas Cechvala\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nNFV and virtualized high performance applications, such as video processing,require a “fast data stack” solution that provides both carrier gradeforwarding performance, scalability and open extensibility, along withfunctionality for realizing application policies and controlling a complexnetwork topology. This session discusses how different components in OpenStackand OpenDaylight are being evolved to integrate with the new open sourceVirtual Packet Processor (VPP) forwarder provided by the FD.io LinuxFoundation project to build such a solution stack. The FastDataStacks is runas an OPNFV project where leverages OPNFV’s continuous integration, deploymentand test pipeline as well as the automated component install and testinfrastructure.\n\n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 14:30:00"
