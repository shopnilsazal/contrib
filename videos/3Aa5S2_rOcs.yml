Are server-less and state-less the opposite of what they appear? Can we trust the AIs? If you ever ask yourself this kind of question, you'll probably enjoy this talk.\n\nAbout Anne Currie\nCTO, Microscaling Systems\nAnne has spent over 20 years in the tech sector working on everything from worthy server products in the '90s to international online lingerie in the '00s to containers and the future of operations in the '10s."
