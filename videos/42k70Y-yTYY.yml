title: '#HITB2017AMS COMMSEC D2 - Unauthorized Erlang: A Demonstration - Don Bailey'
recordingDate: 1493973974
description: "From a functional programming perspective, Erlang is an excellent language that substantially reduces risk when writing code. What many developers don’t understand is that Erlang is built on an architecture and within ecosystem that contains many subtle security flaws. One such set of flaws allows anyone with the ability to interact with a remote Erlang node to compromise that node by abusing the underlying BEAM Virtual Machine and the services required to run Erlang.\n\nThe author’s previous work on Erlang security risks was demonstrated in 2016 at LambdaConf. This work detailed internal flaws that could be subverted by a clever attacker with the ability to pass messages through an Erlang system. This demonstration and discussion focuses on the ability to attack an Erlang node with only the ability to connect to an arbitrary Erlang instance and abuse it without knowing the correct security keys.\n\n===\n\nDon A. Bailey loves his baby boy Pierce, tacos, and IoT.\n\nHe is an internationally respected security researcher known for breaking ground in the mobile and embedded security spaces. Don has given over thirty unique lectures on various advances in security technology over the last eight years, both around the world and within the United States. His research has been highlighted on news exchanges such as CNN, Reuters, NPR, BBC, FOX, and CBS. Don was recently featured in the IEEE Security & Privacy magazine for his recent work reverse engineering M2M systems such as vehicle security modules. Previously the Research Director for a prestigious security firm, Mr. Bailey recently founded the consulting and engineering organization Capitol Hill Consultants LLC. At CHC, Don focuses on government contracting, global defense-centric engagements, and mobile security consulting."
