description: "In this GDC Europe 2015 talk, Ultima Ratio Regum roguelike creator Mark Johnson explores the difficult balance between handmade and algorithmic/procedural content in games that use both. First, it examines the benefits of each kind of content, focusing particularly on player-side questions of learning and game mastery, and developer-side questions of development time and effort. Secondly, the talk examines methods for balancing these two types of content and avoiding the temptation to add arbitrary procedural content that does not integrate with overall design goals.\n\nFollow us on Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/Official_GDC\n\nCheckout our Facebook page for GDC exclusives\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GameDevelopersConference\n\nhttp://www.gdconf.com/"
