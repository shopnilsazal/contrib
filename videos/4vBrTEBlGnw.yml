description: "You want to model a world. That world has millions of people, who also interact with each other. How would you even start tackling this model in Ruby? I'd like to demonstrate one solution. In this talk, we'll explore this problem from inception. See how the process can evolve from the simple first model to a much more complicated interactive tool. This talk will cover topics such as getting Ruby to do more than one thing at once, sampling discrete probability distributions in constant time, and the perils of garbage collection and a few other suprises.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGe8/"
