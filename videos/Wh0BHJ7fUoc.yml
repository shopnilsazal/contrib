description: "Remember when Avi Bryant spoke at RailsConf '07 about Ruby's future, and how it'd be slick if we could get to where Smalltalk was 30 years ago? Well, we kinda have, in some respects, with the 1.0 release of MagLev, a Ruby implementation running on a Smalltalk VM.\n\nWhat makes MagLev really special? How about a baked-in object database that sits on top of a VM almost 30 years in the making? There are a lot of cool things you can do with this type of persistence, but it's quite different from what we do in a typical Ruby app.\n\nLet's explore what this great implementation has to offer, and learn how to help it along.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGfO/"
