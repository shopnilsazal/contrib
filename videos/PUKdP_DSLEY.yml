description: "Live from AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\n\nKeynote: Renee Guttmann - CISO Perspectives: Aligning Secure Software Application Development with Business Interests\n\nThursday, September 18 • 4:30pm - 5:30pm\n\nSoftware security is first, and foremost, a business problem. Attackers have learned that nearly all web applications can be exploited via application-level vulnerabilities. Using any one of a long list of common entry points, an attacker can make the software misbehave in a variety of ways, including granting access to unauthorized data. Security-conscious organizations recognize this threat and are making secure application development a business priority. By doing this, they are creating leading programs to help protect against reputational risk, brand damage, and to improve customer experiences.\n\nDuring this presentation, you will learn:\n·        How to create a vision of software security success aligned with business goals.\n·        Activities that security practitioners can establish to improve application security.\n·        Ways to think differently about the impact of application security so you can innovate change and be more successful with your program.\n·        Techniques to address today’s risks and tomorrow’s opportunities.\n\n\nSpeaker\nRenee Gutman\nVice President, Information Risk, Accuvant\nRenee Guttmann is an accomplished global information security and privacy executive with a proven track record of establishing internationally recognized information security programs for Fortune 500 companies.
