description: "by: Jonathan Weiss\n\nOne important part of the DevOps movement is infrastructure automation, especially if you are running your application on top of services like Amazon EC2.\n\nEverybody's dream is to be able to bootstrap and deploy hundreds or even thousands of machines with a few simple commands. This talk will tell you how you can do this using Open Source tools like Chef and mcollective. Chef manages your servers configuration using a nice Ruby DSL while mcollective orchestrates and commands all your nodes."
