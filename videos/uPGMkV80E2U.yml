description: "AppSec California 2015 - Day 1, Track 2, Slot 5\n\nTitle\n\nAnatomy of memory scraping, credit card stealing POS malware\n\nAbstract\n\nCredit card payment processing and point-of-sale (POS) systems are like a black box for most people without knowledge of its internal workings. But recent data breaches of thousands of credit cards have shown that determined attackers have not only mastered ways to steal magnetic stripe cards, but also targeted EMV chip cards.\n\nThe session will start by explaining the architecture of different type of POS systems along with its components, operation and integration. This includes magnetic stripe track data format, technology behind credit card readers, point-of-sale hardware and software. A common element in POS attacks is the credit card swipe. Swiping refers to the process of reading un-encrypted credit card data from the magnetic strip of the card by a card reader and communication between the POS terminal. I will explain various malware attack techniques used for exploitation and exfiltration of credit card data. This will include RAM scraping, process hooking and injection, keyboard hooks, command and control techniques as well as Luhn algorithm. A live demo of a PoC ram scraping malware and its internal working will be shown along with explanation of key concepts. A live demo of a working POS system compromise based on a malware that I created for research purpose will be shown. This will be followed by Q&A which will conclude the session.\n\nBio\n\nAmol heads Qualys’ worldwide security engineering team responsible for vulnerability and compliance research. His team tracks emerging threats and develops software which identifies new vulnerabilities and insecure posture for Qualys’ VM, PC, PCI and QBC services.\n\nAmol is a veteran of the security industry and has devoted his career to protecting, securing and educating the community from security threats. Amol has presented his research on Vulnerability Trends, Security Axioms, SCADA security, Malware and other security topics at numerous security conferences, including RSA Conference, BlackHat, Hacker Halted, SecTor, BSides, InfoSec Europe, NullCon, GrrCon, ISSA, Homeland security Network HSNI and FS/ISAC. He regularly contributes to the SANS Top 20 expert consensus identifying the most critical security vulnerabilities. He writes the “HOT or NOT” column for SC Magazine and holds a US patent for Systems and Methods for Performing Remote Configuration Compliance Assessment of a Networked Computer Device\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
