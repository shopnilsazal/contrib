description: "Kubernetes, Metadata and You [I] - Liz Rice, Aqua Security & Gareth Rushgrove, Puppet\n\nThe combination of CI/CD tools and Kubernetes means we can set up a pipeline for deploying code changes as they happen, triggering a container image build and a rolling update to pull the new image. But what about changes that are about the application and how it should run, rather than the code itself? \n\nThis talk will explore tools and approaches for managing application metadata alongside the application code. We will look at:\n\n- The importance of metadata to managing modern Cloud Native systems\n- Built-in metadata capabilities in Kubernetes like ConfigMaps, Annotations and Labels\n- Ways of making a deployment self-describing as part of a CI/CD workflow\n- Using metadata to make the life of Kubernetes operators easier\n- Examples of open source tools (like Manifesto, Lumogon and Skopeo) which work with Kubernetes ecosystem metadata\n\nAbout Liz Rice\nLiz Rice is the Technology Evangelist with container security specialists Aqua Security, and also works on container-related open source projects including manifesto and kube-bench. She has a wealth of software development, team, and product management experience from working on network protocols and distributed systems, and in digital technology sectors such as VOD, music, and VoIP. When not writing code, or talking about it, Liz loves riding bikes in places with better weather than her native London.\n\nAbout Gareth Rushgrove\nGareth Rushgrove is a principal software engineer at Puppet. He works remotely from Cambridge, UK, building interesting tools for people to better manage infrastructure. Previously he worked for the UK Government Digital Service focused on infrastructure, operations and information security. When not working he can be found writing the Devops Weekly newsletter or hacking on software in new-fangled programming languages."
