recordingDate: 1383200332
description: "By Christopher Meiklejohn\n\nTraditional programming languages use a model of computation where individual instructions are executed in order. However, when building distributed systems this model fails to match the reality of how your application code is actually executed. Bloom is a language which allows programmers to build applications as a series of unordered statements while also providing facilities for imposing a particular ordering of events when necessary.\n\nDuring this talk we will explore building applications in Bud, which is a prototype of Bloom implemented as a domain specific language in Ruby. We will discuss the concepts of logical monotonicity, disorderly collections, the CALM principle which is the root of the Bloom language, and how to use he Bloom language to identify critical sections of your code where a coordiation library should be used to ensure consistency.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG6a/"
