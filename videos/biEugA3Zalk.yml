description: "Escoria, a libre point'n'click framework using Godot Engine \"Oh, it looks just like SCUMM!\" -- Tim Schafer\nby Rémi Verschelde and Julian Murgia\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe Godot community has released a full-featured point'n'click adventure gameframework based on Godot Engine. It is fully open source (MIT licensed) andcomes with a great open source manual and demo game written by Ariel Manzur,the Escoria creator, and the FLOSS Manuals FR community. This presentationaims at showcasing Escoria, its features and the basics of using it, to giveattendants a good starting point for creating their own point'n'click games.\n\nBack when they kickstarted their Godot Engine-powered point'n'click adventuregame [The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça andPizzaboy](http://store.steampowered.com/app/330420/), its developers hadpromised that they would release the framework they developed under a free andopen source license. This finally happened in October 2016, after someimportant refactoring to make it suitable for any kind of point'n'click game.At the same time, a great open source manual and demo game (see links) werereleased, written by Ariel Manzur, the Escoria creator, and the FLOSS ManualsFR community.\n\nThe free and open source world has therefore an advanced point'n'clickframework at the ready with both source code, demos and documentation, onlywaiting for game designers and artists to create awesome adventure games (bothopen source and proprietary, the engine license is not restrictive). To givean idea of the tool's maturity, Tim Schafer of LucasArts and Double FineProductions said of it, when visiting the developers of The InteractiveAdventures of Dog Mendonça and Pizzaboy, that \"it looks just like SCUMM!\" (theengine used by LucasArts for their classic adventure games). Escoria is basedon the 2D and 3D Godot game engine, and can thus leverage many features thatare not common in point'n'click adventure games, which allows for the creationof interesting hybrid genres.\n\nIn this presentation, we will showcase the features of Escoria, how to setup anew project with it and use its scripting language to create classicpoint'n'click scenes. Basic knowledge of Godot's interface is not mandatory,as we will try to explain also what features are specific to Escoria and whichones are specific to Godot. The presentation will reuse elements of theexisting manual and demo in attempt to be as clear as possible, and to allowattendants to continue their discovery of Escoria using resources they arealready familiar with.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 15:30:00"
