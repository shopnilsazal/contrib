description: "The evolution of Octopus, Uber Engineering's platform-agnostic test runner, from cross-app/cross-device testing, to network record/replay and scenario-based testing.\n\nFrom our July 7, 2016 Meetup. For more info see: https://eng.uber.com \n\n===================================================\nMore on the Uber Engineering Mobility Meetups Series\nhttps://www.uber.com/p/uber-mobility/\n\nWelcome to Uber Mobility, a meetup series focused on building scalable, high-quality mobile applications. The platform-agnostic topics today will help you build better mobile applications at scale for a global market.\n\nHaving the right testing strategy and good automation coverage are both essential for any mobile company wanting to iterate quickly and release high quality apps faster. So is having confidence in your mobile application build before you release. Once released, fixing problems is hard: you can’t roll back bad builds quickly and you can’t control whether users will actually upgrade to your hotfix build.\n\nThis evening is all about testing applications: from writing consistent and deterministic tests, to setting up scaleable CI systems, to effectively distributing tests on CI, to setting the right cadence and release strategy. You will learn from other industry forerunners who have successfully implemented these strategies at their companies, and you will learn how to ensure the continued growth of your business by using effective testing.\n\nMore on Uber Engineering Events: http://www.meetup.com/UberEvents/"
