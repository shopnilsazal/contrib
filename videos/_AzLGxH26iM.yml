description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Nicola Corti, Yelp Inc..\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-39\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/cortinico/the-curious-case-of-android-button-yelp-engineering\n\nWe interact with buttons every day to get coffee, order pizza, or start a new Gradle build. They may look simple and straightforward, but they have a fundamental role in our environment: create a sense of power.\n\nWe all love to feel empowered and we all hate being frustrated by bad design. Your users know this as well, they want to feel immediately rewarded when they interact with your UI, and they will quickly drop your app if they get annoyed.\n\nAt Yelp, we get tens of millions button clicks a day. At that kind of scale, every pixel matters. We tune every single aspect of our buttons to make them simple and powerful, but adjusting every single shadow cast, click animation, or color layer can be tricky. In this talk, we will provide a deep dive into the Android framework and the Support Library to understand how buttons are rendered.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
