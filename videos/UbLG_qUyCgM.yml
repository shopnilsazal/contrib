description: "Microservices, Service Mesh, and CI/CD Pipelines: Making It All Work Together [I] - Brian Redmond, Microsoft\n\nMicroservices come with many advantages for massively scaling applications. With that comes many challenges around service communication and application updates. It is pretty simple to do blue/green deployment and canary releases with a basic web site. But what about thousands of microservices? How can we have blue/green deployments at the service level while still allowing for efficient communication? This is one of the areas where service mesh technology is a huge benefit in Kubernetes. \n\nIn this session, I will show how to use common CI/CD tooling such as Spinnaker or Jenkins to drive microservices deployments with Kubernetes. I will show how service mesh technologies such as istio and linkerd ease the ability to efficiently deliver and test microservices in Kubernetes. All without substantial changes for the microservice developer. Additionally, I will provide comparisons of the wide variety of tools available in this area. \n\nThe overall goal of this demo heavy session is to show the value of these technologies working together to ease the delivery of cloud native applications.\n\nAbout Brian Redmond\nBrian Redmond is an Azure Architect on the Global Black Belt team.
