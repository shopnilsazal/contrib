title: '#HITB2018AMS CommSec D1 - An Isolated Data Center Security Policy Model Using SmartNICs - Ofir Arkin'
recordingDate: 1524383056
description: "Data-center security has been forced to reinvent itself as software complexity increases, networking capabilities grow more agile, and attack complexity turns unmanageable. With this change, the need for security policy enforcement to be handled at the edge has pushed functionality onto host compute systems, resulting in inherent performance loss and security weakness due to consolidation of resources.\n\nWe will be presenting a SmartNIC-based model for data-center security that solves both the performance problem and the security problems of edge-centric policy models. A SmartNIC-based data-center security model features more robust isolation of responsibilities, superior offload capabilities, and significantly better scaling.\n\nTo illustrate this, we present a SmartNIC-based reference architecture for network layout, as well as examples of SmartNIC security controls and their resulting threat models. We will performing a live demo of a new innovative technique for host introspection that removed common dependencies on the host compute.\n\n=== \n\nOfir Arkin is the Vice President of Security at Mellanox Technologies where he is responsible for creating, driving and coordinating the overall vision and product strategy for security across all products.\n\nPrior to his tenure at Mellanox Technologies, Ofir served as Vice President and Chief Architect at Intel Security (McAfee) where he was responsible for driving and coordinating the overall architectural vision across Intel Security products.\n\nPrior to his role as Chief Architect, Ofir served as CTO for the Security Management Business, and was responsible for driving the vision and product strategy for McAfeeâ€™s security management business unit.\n\nJoining McAfee as part of the acquisition of Insightix, Ofir pioneered the use of messaging in the field of security to share information in real-time, between different security products and solutions through the use of a single API, to enable an adaptive security infrastructure (also known as the Data Exchange Layer). Ofir led cross-functional teams on the architecture, strategy and execution of this adaptive security infrastructure. His work in this area created the design and accelerated the development of DXL, culminating in the release of McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange, the first technology fully leveraging DXL.\n\nPrior to his tenure at McAfee, he founded Insightix, an innovator of real-time security intelligence and control solutions where he served as CTO. He has also authored numerous research papers, patents, patent applications, advisories and influential articles covering adaptive security, information warfare, network visibility, access control, VoIP security and remote OS fingerprinting."
