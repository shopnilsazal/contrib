title: 'Use of word embedding algorithms and siamese recurrent neural networks - Mikołaj Sędek, Rafał Wojdan'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510573202
description: "We would like to present a data science approach to business case of clustering similar objects on Allegro platform. Our solution is using text embeddings (GloVe algorithm) as input to training supervised similarity models - siamese recurrent neural networks in Tensorflow (TF and Keras API). We will present results of our models and business application of our method.\n\nMikołaj Sędek, Rafał Wojdan - Use of word embedding algorithms and siamese recurrent neural networks for Allegro offers clustering\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
