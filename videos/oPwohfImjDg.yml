description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nSecuring Serverless Functions via Kubernetes Objects - Sebastien Goasguen, Bitnami (Advanced Skill Level)\n\nServerless is fast becoming a new application architecture paradigm. As glue code that links cloud services together it is tempting to forget about the security of functions being deployed. In this talk we will discuss the very important security considerations that we still need to keep in mind with serverless functions. Using kubeless, the kubernetes native serverless solution and focusing on AWS EKS deployment we will discuss how Pod identity, Pod security context, Network Policies, AWS IAM profiles and API gateways can all be used in concert to create a secure serverless application.\nDemonstrations will highlight how Kubernetes brings critical value-add to a serverless solution and will re-inforce the need for a strong security mindset for cloud-native applications.\n\nAbout Sebastien Goasguen\nSeb has been working on Kubernetes since June 2014, he is the author/co-author of the O'Reilly Docker cookbook and the Kubernetes cookbook. With many years of experience teaching computer science he stills enjoys teaching people Kubernetes and getting them off the ground and on their container journey. Currently he works at Bitnami where he oversees all things Kubernetes, he prototyped Kubeless, the Kubernetes native serverless framework and other community tools like kompose and Cabin. In 2008 he was selected for the first round of Astronaut selection by ESA but sadly is still stuck on earth."
