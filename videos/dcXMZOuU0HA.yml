Cornucopia or Panopticon?\r\n\r\nWe'll look at the poor state of the current IoT in terms of \r\nsecurity, privacy and interoperation.  We'll consider a set of \r\nrequirements for a better IoT.  And we'll look at what\r\nwe as Pythonistas can do to improve on this, as a community\r\nand an industry."
