He's currently doing remote work in Haskell. Among the technical topics that interest Oskar are functional programming, systems design, web technology, and programming languages. His more aesthetic side, which mostly involves music, draws him towards graphics and UI design every now and then.\n\nwickstrom.tech\n\nFinite-state machines? Your compiler wants in!\n\nWhen modeling problem domains, we collect different possible states, legal transitions between states, and relevant data for each state. Finite-state machines emerge. To verify that programs are constructed correctly, and to have a living machine-verified documentation, we should let the compiler in on our trade secrets.\n\nIn this talk we will look at motivations and examples of encoding finite-state machines, using expressive type systems in functional languages."
