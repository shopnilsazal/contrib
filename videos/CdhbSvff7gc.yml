description: "by Jesus M. Gonzalez-Barahona\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe Rust project has become a large software development project. To betterunderstand how it is being developed, a software development analyticsdashboard has been deployed for it. This dashboard tracks most of the publicdata about Rust development, and allows to visualize, drill down andunderstand that data. The talk will present this dashboard, and how to use itto learn about the details of Rust development processes and community. Itwill also present some interesting data obtained from it.\n\nThe Rust software development dashboard visualizes data obtained from somesystems used to support Rust development: git, GitHub, StackOverflow... Thedata related to Rust is retrieved from them, stored, organized an massaged ina database, and later visualized in the dashboard. The dashboard allows notonly to browse the data, but also to drill down and play with it. This way,any person interested in how Rust is being developed can have both an generaloverview, or very detailed views of the community and processes involved. Thedashboard permits to track activity (in commits, issues, pull requests,questions and answers, etc.), actors (who is creating the code, who is fixingbugs, who is answering questions), and processes (hot long does it take toclose issues, or to accept pull requests).\n\nThe Rust Development Dashbard has been deployed using GriomoireLab, ancomplete FOSS system for retrieving data from software developmentrepositories, storing it, and producing different kinds of analytics,dashboards and reports.\n\nThe talk will present the different kind of information that can be obtainedfrom the dashboard, and how to interact with it for finding any detail ofinterest. Several specific aspects of Rust development will be presented aswell, so that people attending may expect to finish the talk with a betterunderstanding of how Rust is being developed. The talk will also provide hintson how to exploit the data behind the dashboard to obtain specificinformation.\n\n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 12:30:00"
