language: English
recordingDate: 1508455060
description: 'GoTenna is a wireless communication tool, popular for providing encrypted "off-the-grid" communications on unlicensed MURS channels. Using SDR, GNU Radio, and scapy we developed a tool to capture packets from all the channels, simultaneously. This allowed us to characterize device behavior, study the packet protocol, and passively monitor communications. In this talk, we will explain or methodologies, demonstrate our tools live, and show how to preform link analysis: who is talking with whom, when, and how much.'
