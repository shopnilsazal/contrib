description: "How They Work Better Together: Lean UX, Agile Development and User-Centered Design by John Athayde\n\nDesign has often been cut off from the development side of the house, creating static images that are then handed off to developers to build. Invariably, this waterfall approach leads to unhappy designers and frustrated programmers, and often a product that misses the mark. We'll study successes and failures from both consultancies (InfoEther, Hyphenated People, Meticulous) and product companies both large and small (LivingSocial, CargoSense).\n\nJohn Athayde is a designer and developer who spends a lot of time fighting bad coding practices in the Rails view layer. He is currently the VP of Design for CargoSense, a logistics product company. Prior to this he was the Lead for UI/UX and Front-end Development--Internal Apps at LivingSocial.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG00/"
