recordingDate: 1513372465
description: "Evolving and Supporting Stateful, Multi-Tenant Decisioning Applications in Production [A] - Keith Gasser, Capital One\n\nWith our adoption of Kubernetes at Capital One, we have simultaneously reduced our application delivery time-to-market while providing a common platform for streaming pipelines. We leverage Kubernetes to manage stateful decisioning applications for multiple tenants and provide a host of analytical tools as platform services to help data scientists iteratively improve decision models. We will discuss the challenges in operating these pipelines which consist of Apache Nifi canvases/flows for data ingress/egress, Kafka as persistent stream backbone, Flink for decisioning, and a number of other popular open source data analytics packages such as Apache Drill and Zeppelin forming our “Analytical Environment.”\n\nAbout Keith Gasser\nKeith is a Software Engineer specializing in DevOps and Application Security at Capital One currently working on a team which has built a Kubernetes-based streaming and decisioning pipeline for Capital One Bank."
