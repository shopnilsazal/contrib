description: "Cloning Access Cards to Implants \nAlex Smith @CyberiseMe\n\nEver cloned an office access card but been afraid you'd be caught and searched? In this talk I'll show you how to clone RFID cards to subdermal implants to avoid detection.\n\nThis talk will cover the basics of RFID security, card cloning and RFID implants. It will focus on the AT5577 chip in the new implantable form factor and show how to use it to access RFID controlled security systems.\n\nBIO: Alex is a DIY cyborg, aka grinder. He designs, builds and implants cybernetic devices."
