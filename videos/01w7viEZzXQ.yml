language: English
recordingDate: 1500922133
description: 'Even if you''ve never used Go''s syscall package - in fact even if you''ve only ever written "Hello, world" - you have definitely used syscalls. They provide the interface between your code and the operating system. In this talk we''ll go under the hood to explore what syscalls are, how they work, and how some common Go code makes of use of them. We''ll cover what people mean when they talk about libc / glibc, and look at what syscalls have to do with privileges and permissions, with plenty of demos to illustrate what''s happening.'
