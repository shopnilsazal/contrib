description: "Mike Metzger - Letting the Air Out of Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems\nSince 2008 every new car sold in the US requires some type of Tire Pressure Monitoring System be installed. The most popular uses simple unencrypted RF communications to relay the tire pressure information back to the car ECU. This talk goes over the basic history, implementation, and most importantly the unforeseen issues with privacy and subversion of TPM systems\n\nMike Metzger is a technology consultant offering network, security, virtualization, and programming services for his company Flexible Creations. He has spent the past 14 years in networking and security working for various companies dealing with firewall, IDS/IPS, DLP, network storage, etc. Lately he has become much more involved with physical computing & fabrication and is a member of the Dallas Makerspace and a founder of the Dallas area Embedded Workshop group.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
