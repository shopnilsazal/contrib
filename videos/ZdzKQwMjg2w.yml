description: "Autoscaling a Multi-Platform Kubernetes Cluster Built with kubeadm [I] - Lucas Käldström, Upper Secondary School Student - Individual Maintainer\n\nDoes Kubernetes run on any architecture other than Intel/AMD64? Yes it does, since v1.3.0. \nLucas Käldström (@luxas), a general upper secondary school student, added support for ARM and ARM 64-bit to the core codebase earlier this year. Kubernetes is all about letting you choose the container runtime, the operating system, the environment (cloud vs bare metal) etc., so why wouldn’t you like to choose CPU architecture as well? \n\nThe talk demonstrates Kubernetes’ multi-architecture features in a very practical manner: by having a 10-node cluster of credit-card-sized devices with three architectures (amd64, arm and arm64) in front of the audience. The cluster is deployed with kubeadm. For the demo, a cross-platform nginx workload will be created from the dashboard, deployed to all nodes regardless of architecture, monitored via an auto-updating grafana dashboard and autoscaled by a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler while traffic is generated against the cluster’s Ingress controller. And just to make things more exciting, a node’s power cable may be unplugged by a volunteer from the audience, at any time during the heavy traffic to demonstrate Kubernetes’ auto-healing functions.\n\nAbout Lucas Käldström\nHi there and thanks for finding my talk!\nI'm a Swedish-speaking Upper Secondary School Student from Finland.\n\nI'm really excited about Kubernetes and new emerging technologies.\nI have been engaged in Kubernetes for about two years now and ported Kubernetes to ARM, both 32 and 64-bit as my first larger contribution. I've written an accepted proposal for how Kubernetes should work on multiple platforms. I've been a maintainer for Kubernetes on my spare time since April 2016. I was in the group that started Minikube as well, but then in August 2016 I moved on to maintaining kubeadm, which I have focused on since then."
