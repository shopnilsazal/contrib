title: 'On @annotations - liberate yourselves from demons by Jarek Ratajski'

description: "Symptoms: - tedious code containing only getters and setter, - useless tests that only test mocks and NOT the business of the system, - frustration – you read a lot of books about JEE, Spring, JPA, spend your time on stack overflow findiong out that you always make things wrong, - fear of refactoring - yes, you have tests – but small change somewhere and suddenly injections do not work anymore, - You constantly need a real sorcerer and his XML spells in order to keep system running.\n\nIs that is what you do for living?\n\nLast but not least - you are so jealous hearing that some other teams write great things in Scala, Python or even JavaScript in a few weeks.\n\nI know the problem. It is not Java that is bad ! The cancer is called @Annotations. Something that was introduced to liberate Java developers from XML programming hell. But after few years it became even a bigger mess. Really - @annotations are the Java GOTO.\n\nAfter 16 years of programming with Java EE (and Spring, CDI, OSGi) I am sure that almost (there are few good exceptions) every annotation that you put in code is just a code smell and the proof you just do not know Java possibilities.
