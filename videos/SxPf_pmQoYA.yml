description: "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nWe've seen how easy it is to modify CPythonâ€”it's a C program after all, and one written to be understood and extended by normal human beings. But beyond the slow, deliberative process of adding features to the core language, what is the value of hacking your interpreter?\n\nThis talk presents a practical example of dynamic code instrumentation using hacked interpreters.\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
