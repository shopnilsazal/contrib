title: 'DEF CON 25 Wifi Village - Nick Delewski - Failsafe: Yet Another SimpliSafe Attack Vector'
language: English
recordingDate: 1508455062
description: 'The SimpliSafe alarm system has been marketed plainly since 2008, but scrutiny shows architecture and implementation failings in several system components that make it unsuitable for high-security applications in today''s threat environment. Previous work has demonstrated: *the retrieval of disarm codes via captured RF signal *signal jamming attacks *physical attacks against sensors In this presentation, an experienced network pentester will detail some of his first experiences researching vulnerabilities over the USB protocol. USBMon, python, and general reverse engineering skills will be used to discover and weaponize an attack on weak access controls within the USB functionality of the system''s remote keyfob. The speaker will make recommendations to both consumers/system owners to help mitigate their immediate risk as well as outline some steps device makers can take to avoid similar pitfalls'
