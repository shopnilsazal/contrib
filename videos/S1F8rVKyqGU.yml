recordingDate: 1431531466
description: "by Sharon Steed\n\nDevelopers are trained to communicate to things with a goal in mind. When you're talking to something like, say a computer, you type in your code and it responds by giving you back what you want. Simple and straight-forward. Talking to humans? That's more of a challenge. Why? Because communicating with people requires a special set of skills - namely, empathy and a little bit of storytelling. In an industry filled with brilliant minds, great ideas and mass disruption, so few of the best and brightest know how to tell their compelling story. This workshop will teach you how."
