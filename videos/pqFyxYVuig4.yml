description: "Copy of the slides for this talk are here:https://media.defcon.org/dc-20/presentations/Esden-and-Panel/DEFCON-20-Esden-Panel-Paparazzi-Platform.pdf \n\nThe Paparazzi Platform: Flexible, Open-Source, UAS Software and Hardware\nesden\ndotAero\nmisterj\ncifo\n\nThis presentation introduces the Paparazzi framework, an Open-Source (GPL3 and OSHW CC-by-SA) software and hardware robotics platform focused on Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASes). Paparazzi's power and flexibility enable rapid development and robust control of diverse vehicle types \" from fixed-wing airplanes to multicopters and transitioning aircraft \" while its open nature permit customization and integration with other systems.\n\nWe show the capabilities of the platform and some achievements from all around the world with this platform. We also will show what we are working on and introduce it to the public.\n\nWhat will you do with that powerful tool?\n\nThe Paparazzi autopilots, a multicopter, and the Quadshot \" a VTOL, multirotor, transitioning flying wing \" are presented.\n\nesden received his degree in Computer Science from the University of Applied Sciences, Rosenheim in 2008 and acted as research assistant at the Intelligent Autonomous Systems Group at T.U. Munich until 2009. In 2010 he began work at Joby Energy Inc. as an Embedded Systems and Motor Control Engineer. In 2011 he co-founded Transition Robotics, Inc. where he serves as the Embedded Systems and Avionics Engineer. He is a long term member of the Open-Source community and is core developer of Paparazzi UAV, libopencm3 cortex-m3 open source firmware library, open-bldc open source brushless motor controller, he is also involved with many other Open-Source projects and submitting patches here and there. ;)\nTwitter: @esden\nFacebook: esdentem\nhttp://www.esden.net\n\ndotAero obtained an S.B. in Aerospace Engineering from MIT in 2009 and an M.S.E. (Aerospace Engineering) from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2010 and worked on diverse projects ranging from designs for electrically-propelled spacecraft to stall and surge resistant compressors, and underwater ROVs during his university career.From 2010-2011, he served as the Lead Engineer for Aerodynamics at Joby Energy, Inc. He enjoys working on innovative aerodynamic design concepts for UAVs, which led him to co-found Transition Robotics, Inc. in 2011, where he serves as the Aerodynamics and Controls Engineer. He is designing dedicated airframes for Paparazzi vehicles since 2010.\n\n\nmisterj received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Pomona College in 2002 and worked at Apple Computer, Inc. until 2007. In 2008 he began work at Joby Energy, Inc. and in 2010, he received his M.S.M.E. from San Jose State University with emphases on Mechatronics and Design. In 2011, he co-founded Transition Robotics, Inc. where he serves as the Mechanical Engineer. He is doing mechanical design for Paparazzi dedicated airframes since 2008. He also designs self balancing one wheel skateboards.\n\n\ncifo grew up with model aviation and took Aeronautical Engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. In 2011 he co-founded Transition Robotics, Inc. where he heads up prototyping and flight testing. He is integrating and flying Paparazzi based UAV since 2011."
