description: 'This presentation will dive into hacking wireless security systems present in many residential homes. A number of common wireless sensors are susceptible to a wide range of vulnerabilities including denial of service attacks, replay attacks and information disclosures. Sensors that detect motion, smoke, water leaks, gas leaks and open doors use similar weak communication protocols. Weaknesses in these sensors can present a juicy target to a tech savvy thief. With a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino, it''s possible to exploit these weaknesses as well as create your own robust alarm system. With this system, you can customize text message alerts and detect a denial of service attack. This presentation will discuss how to exploit these vulnerabilities and how to use the same exploits to defend against the dark arts.'
