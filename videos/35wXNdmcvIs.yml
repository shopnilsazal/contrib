description: "By Sam Livingston-Gray\nExperienced developers tend to build up a library of creative problem-solving tools: rubber ducks, code smells, anthropomorphizing code, et cetera.\n\nThese tools map abstract problems into forms our brains are good at solving. But our brains are also good at lying to us.\n\nWe'll talk about some of these tools, when to use them (or not), and how their biases can lead us astray.\n\n“A change in perspective is worth 80 IQ points.” -Alan Kay\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGYJ/"
