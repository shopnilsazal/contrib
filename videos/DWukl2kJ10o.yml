description: "Numpy and pandas are the corner stones of data analysis in python. They allow for efficient data access and manipulation. Yet, they are not always appropriate for more heterogeneous data usage, when access patterns are hard to predict, or when you need to support write parallelism. This is an area where traditional databases systems still shine compared to the traditional data scientist toolset.\n\nThe goal of this tutorial is to give you an idea of how databases can help you dealing with data which are not just numerical, with minimal effort or knowledge. We will focus on Postgresql, an open source database that have powerful extensions to deal with heterogeneous (aka 'schemaless') data, while being simple to use from python."
