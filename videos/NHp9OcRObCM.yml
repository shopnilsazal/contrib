description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Jonathan Maltz, Yelp Inc..\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-38\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/maltzj/want-to-make-a-change-stop-talking-and-start-listening-android-makers-2018\n\nAs Android developers, we’re constantly trying to improve our teams by convincing others to move in a new direction. Whether it’s convincing other engineers to adopt Kotlin or convince your design team to create Android mocks, almost any improvement you want to make requires convincing others to make a change.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss how to effectively create the change you want by focusing on the incentives of others. We’ll start by discussing how to understand what other parties want so that you can make it clear how your initiative helps all stakeholders. Next, we’ll talk about how to identify areas of risk that may prevent your idea from moving forward, as well as how to mitigate that risk. Finally, we’ll discuss the critical role of trust in creating change, and how to use every interaction as a chance to build the trust you need to help you succeed.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
