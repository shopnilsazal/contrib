description: "Are you confident that your code works the way you expect? Is it easy to change? Do you get accurate feedback when you do change it? If the answer to any of these questions is no, the problem is not your code: it's your tests.\n\nWe'll look at the state-of-the-art Ruby testing libraries and frameworks to start you off with an effective testing toolset. In addition to the toolset, we'll also explore the testing mindset. Should I mock this or stub it? Should I write a unit test or an integration test? How do I write tests that allow me to refactor with confidence? If you've ever asked yourself questions like these, this session is for you.\n\nIntended for new testers; those who \"just don't get this testing thing;\" people with brittle, unwieldy test suites they need to work into shape; and everyone in between.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GZSg/"
