description: "Behind the critical success of BioShock Infinite is the game's heart and soul, Elizabeth. Not only did Elizabeth carry the narrative weight of BioShock Infinite on her shoulders, she was also a robust AI that allowed for many systemic interactions. The creation of Elizabeth was an organic process that evolved over time and included members from every department at Irrational. This GDC 2014 presentation from Irrational Games' Shawn Robertson will go over some of the decisions his team made and the lessons they learned as we gave shape to Elizabeth and attempted to bring her to life.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
