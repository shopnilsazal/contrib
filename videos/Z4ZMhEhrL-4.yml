title: 'Embedding the Containerd Runtime for Fun and Profit [I] - Phil Estes, IBM'
recordingDate: 1513363633
description: "Embedding the Containerd Runtime for Fun and Profit [I] - Phil Estes, IBM\n\nThe containerd project, one of the youngest in CNCF, is purpose-built to be an embeddable container runtime expected for use within higher layer container systems like the Docker engine and the Kubernetes orchestrator. Of course, the intent is that it will be used and embedded within a variety of software systems and has been designed for easy consumption via a gRPC API and client library.\n\nIn this talk we'll walk through a straightforward example of building up a container \"client\" written in Go, using today's containerd client library and API. Similar to how the Kubernetes CRI uses the containerd endpoints or how the Docker engine's libcontainerd operates, our small client will have access to all the same capabilities of container lifecycle management and registry interactions provided by containerd.\n\nTo finish our tour of building a fully functioning containerd client, we will pair our new sample application with LinuxKit and the Moby tool project. Using these tools, we'll build a simple virtual machine that embeds containerd and our sample client to test interesting aspects of containerd's capabilities in our own customized Linux OS image.\n\nAbout Phil Estes\nPhil is a Senior Technical Staff Member in the office of the CTO of IBM Cloud. Phil is a core contributor and maintainer on the Docker engine project where he has contributed key features like user namespace support and multi-platform image capabilities. Phil is also a founding maintainer of the containerd project, and participates in the Open Container Initiative (OCI) as a contributor to the development of runc/libcontainer.\n\nPhil guides both IBM product teams and IBM's customers in applying container technology and concepts to their own cloud native efforts. Phil speaks regularly at industry conferences and meetups and enjoys helping customers and developers alike understand this fast growing ecosystem. Phil is a member of the Docker Captains program and maintains an active blog on container topics at https://integratedcode.us. You can find him on Twitter @estesp."
