As everyone knows Skype takes security very seriously according to their own words: \"The security of your information is of the utmost concern to us here at Skype and something we take very seriously\" So we rose up to the challenge and tried to see if we could beat the system filters and/or software out of the box.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will offer the first in depth view & analysis of the bugs that where found in Skype by the vulnerability-lab.com research team in 2011. The presentation will also provide exclusive attack schemes from an attackers point of view which were also used for verification of our findings.\r\n\r\nBuglist:\r\n\r\n-- Skype 5.3.x 2.2.x 5.2.x -- Persistent Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability\r\n-- Skype 5.3.x 2.2.x 5.2.x -- Persistent Software Vulnerability\r\n-- Skype v5.3.x -- Transfer Standby Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\r\n-- Skype v5.2.x and v5.3.x -- Critical Pointer Vulnerability\r\n-- Skype v5.3.x v2.2.x v5.2.x -- Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nAttack schemes:\r\n\r\n-- Client Side Skype Exploitation (Local & Remote)\r\n-- Server Side Exploitation #1 (Local & Remote)\r\n-- Server Side Exploitation #2 (Local & Remote)\r\n-- Denial of Service Exploitation (Local to Remote)\r\n-- Buffer Overflow Exploitation (Remote)\r\n-- Pointer Bug Exploitation (Local)\r\n\r\nAbout Benjamin Kunz\r\n\r\nBenjamin Kunz M.(28) is active as a penetration tester and security analyst for private and public security firms, hosting entities, banks, isp(telecom) and ips. His specialties are security checks(penetrationtests) on services, software, applications, malware analysis, underground economy, military intelligence/cyberwar, reverse engineering, lectures and workshops about IT Security. During his work as a penetration tester and vulnerability researcher, many open- or closed source applications, software and services were formed more secure. In 1997, Benjamin K.M. founded a non-commercial and independent security research group called, \"Global Evolution -- Security Research Group\" which is still active today.\r\n\r\nFrom 2010 to 2011, Benjamin M. and Pim C. (Research Team) identified over 300 zero day vulnerabilities in well known products from companies such as DELL, Barracuda, Mozilla, Kaspersky, McAfee, Google, Cyberoam, Safari, Bitdefender, Asterisk, Telecom, PBX & SonicWall. In 2010 he founded the company \"Evolution Security\". After the firm's establishment arose the Vulnerability Lab as the legal european initiative for vulnerability researchers, analysts, penetration testers, and serious hacker groups. Ben is also the leader of the Contest + Vulnerability-Lab Research Team. He have a lot of stable references by solved events or contests like ePost SecCup, SCS2, EH2008, Har2009, Da-op3n & exclusive zero-day exploitation sessions/releases."
