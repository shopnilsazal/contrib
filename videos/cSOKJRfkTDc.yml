description: "The Beatles once sang, \"I've got to admit it's getting better, a little better all the time, because it can't get more worse\" and that applies directly to the field application security. The successes in building security into common application development frameworks is remarkable and has, in some ways, made secure coding less of an effort to the developer. While much needs to be done in this area, there are many very positive examples of security characteristics built correctly into frameworks. This talk with bring the positive vibe to AppSec California and highlight that things really are getting better in AppSec - all time - if you look in the right places.\"\n\nJim Manico\nManicode Security\nJim Manico is the founder of Manicode Security where he trains software developers on secure coding and security engineering.
