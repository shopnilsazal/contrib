recordingDate: 1502694955
description: 'InterruptedException is what most of us catch, but few of us really understand what it''s coming from. I will try to explain what''s going on under the hood and why it''s so important to restore interrupted status in the thread. We will discuss the very idea of interrupted concurrency in Java and how we must use it effectively, on the level of user code. I wrote an article about a few months ago, but at the presentation we will try to go a bit deeper into details and discuss different use cases: www.yegor256.com/2015/10/20/interrupted-exception.html'
