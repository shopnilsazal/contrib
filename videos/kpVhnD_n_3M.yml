title: 'ElixirConf 2015 - An Elixir Voice Survey Application by Stephen Pallen'
recordingDate: 1444843620
description: "We will walk through the development of a voice survey application using Phoenix, MySql, and the open source Asterisk PBX. We will build a simple web interface to create survey questions and display the results of completed surveys. We will build an Asterisk AGI application that reads the configured questions to a caller and accept touch tone responses which will be saved for later viewing in the Phoenix application. We will then demonstrate the application.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HO20/"
