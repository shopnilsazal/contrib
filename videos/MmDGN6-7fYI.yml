description: "PyData Dallas 2015\nWhether you modelling an earthquake, hurricane, or medical device, Python is there. The language has become so ubiquitous in scientific research that it is the go to tool. In this presentation, I present different modalities that we see Python being used and how it continues to slither its way into new business. Whether you are running on a large cluster or teaching some new students how to get their next big idea done, Python delivers as a language that can be used by all, scale as needed, and not get in your way while it does it."
