description: "by Philippe Coval\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe OCF/IoTivity project aims to answer interoperability issues in the IoTworld from many different contexts to accommodate a huge range devices frommicrocontrollers, to consumer electronics such as Tizen wearables or yourpowerful GNU/Linux system The vision of Iotivity is not restricted to ad hocenvironment but also can be connected to Internet and make the service easilyaccessible by other parties. With cloud access in place, usage scenarios forIoT devices can be enriched immensely.\n\nIn this talk we walk through the steps on how to practically handle IoT usecases that tailored towards various topologies. To introduce the approach usedin IoTivity, we first give a detailed background introduction on IoTivityframework. Then we will present a demo that shows a few examples, from settingup a basic smart home network to accessing the IoT resource via a third partyonline service. Challenges and solutions will be addressed from developmentand implementation aspects for each step of the demo.\n\nWe hope this talk will inspire developers to create new IoT prototypes usingFLOSS,.\n\nThis will be a shared presentation with Ziran Sun from Samsung Open SourceGroup.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 16:00:00"
