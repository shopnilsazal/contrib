description: "Michael Gorven, Facebook\n\nInstagram deploys code 40 times a day to its fleet of thousands of webservers and userbase of 400M monthly active users automatically when engineers land changes. This talk describes the iterative approach we took to building this system, the problems we faced along the way, the solutions we implemented, and the key principles which enable this to work. These principles include a reliable and fast test suite automatically run during code review and before and after landing; an automated canary to detect significant breakages before being widely deployed; good visibility of and stop mechanisms for the automation; good site monitoring and alarming; and a fast rollback mechanism."
