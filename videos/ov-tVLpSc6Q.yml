title: 'MountainWest JavaScript 2015 - The Death of "Write ONce, Run Everywhere" by Steve Lacy'
recordingDate: 1427477144
description: "We’ve all been sold the tale that with one codebase we can support almost any platform you can imagine. After years of using these tools, nothing has really seemed to solve this problem well. Even when applications are built with tools like Phonegap, they never really “feel” right and fail to live up to native user experience expectations. Is this a fundamental failure of the idea “Write Once, Run Everywhere” or a failure of tooling?\nIn this talk I will discuss the future of building real mobile applications using web technologies, and the alternate idea “Learn Once, Write Everywhere”. You will hear about react-native, UX, Phonegap, Titanium, Trigger.io, and the future of mobile web applications.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GVRe/"
