description: "Ernie Souhrada, Pinterest\n\nThe rise of utility computing has revolutionized much about the way organizations think about infrastructure and back-end serving systems compared to the \"\"olden days\"\" of dedicated physical data centers. However, in the final analysis, success is still driven by meeting your SLAs. If services are up and sufficiently performant, you win. If not, you lose.\n\nIn the traditional data center environment, fighting the uptime battle was typically driven by a philosophy I call \"\"Operational Materialism.\"\" The primary goal of OM is preventing failures at the infrastructure layer, and mechanisms for making this happen are plentiful and well-understood, many of which boil down to simply spending enough money to have at least N+1 of anything that might fail and create significant downtime as a result. Redundant power supplies, NIC bonding, replicated SANs, and hot-standby servers are some of the common artifacts of an OM world."
