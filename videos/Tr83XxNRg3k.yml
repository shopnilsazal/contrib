description: "Stately State Machines with Ragel by Ian Duggan\n\nState machines are an important tool in computer programming, and Ragel is a wonderful tool for creating them. Come learn how to use Ragel to compose simple state machines into much more complicated versions useful for parsing and processing all manner of input. We'll progress simple regex-like machines to full-blown context-sensitive scanners capable of ripping-fast processing of protocols and language grammars.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H0nE/"
