title: '#FlinkForward SF 2017: Joe Olson - Using Flink & Queryable State to Buffer...'
recordingDate: 1492195119
description: "Flink's streaming API can be used to construct a scalable, fault tolerant framework for buffering high frequency time series data, with the goal being to output larger, immutable blocks of data. As the data is being buffered into larger blocks, Flink's queryable state feature can be used to service requests for data still in the \"buffering\" state. The high frequency time series data set in this example is electro cardiogram data (EKG) that is buffered from a sample rate in millisecond into multi minute blocks.\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://BashFilms.com"
