description: "By, David Brady\nYour entire nervous systems literally wired to be reprogrammed. Are you working with its strengths? Do you know how to tell if you're not? In this session we'll explore some exciting discoveries in neuroscience and psychology, and then immediately put this knowledge to use creating iterative change inside our brains. Or maybe we'll just monkeypatch some stuff and see what happens. If you want to start or break new habit instantly, start unit testing your own behavior, or if you just think it would be fun to know how to hack a debug breakpoint into somebody else's brain, this talk is for you!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GJEr/"
