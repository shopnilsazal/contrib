This is sad, even the European Court ofHuman Rights and the European Council ackknowledged: Internet Access is HumanRight. In Germany Freifunk activists and initiatives enabled people to accessinternet and communication, education and information sources in more than 400facilities since 2012.\n\nfreifunk.net means more than 15 years of social and technical innovation infree community networks. Beside Germany there are similar projects in morethan 30 countries living these ideas. By sharing knowledge on how to buildfree community networks, freifunk delivers impulses against digital divide andfor free internet access.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 11:00:00"
