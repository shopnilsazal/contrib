description: 'Since its release in 2001, Effective Java has been the de facto standard best-practices guide for the Java platform. The book was last updated in 2008, when Java 6 was released. In the intervening decade, the platform has had three major releases, introducing many new language and library features that significantly affect best practices. The recently released third edition of Effective Java contains one new chapter, fourteen new items, and numerous changes to existing items. This talk covers some highlights from the third edition, concentrating on streams and lambdas.'
