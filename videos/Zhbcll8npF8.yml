title: 'Agile Roots 2010 - Managing Agile: Transforming the Three Dysfunctions of Management'
recordingDate: 1423766980
description: "By: Diana Larsen\n\nManaging Agile involves designing, supporting and reinforcing a system of work to deliver business value. â€œPrevailingâ€ organizational systems often reinforce and reward management behaviors that produce three dysfunctional paradigms: 1) magical thinking, 2) the illusion of control, and 3) the fantasy of individual blame. The transforming antidotes to these dysfunctions emerge from three key strengths of Agile approaches: relying on data and evidence; accepting uncertainty and unpredictability; and maintaining a whole systems view. In this talk, Diana Larsen will describe ways organizations have reduced their dependence on the dysfunctions and built on the strengths of an Agile way of doing business.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GHFi/"
