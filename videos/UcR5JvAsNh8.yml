description: "Andrii Chaichenko - Building a RESTful real-time analytics system with Pyramid\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nCeleraOne tries to bring its vision to Big Data by developing a unique\nplatform for real-time Big Data processing. The platform is capable of\npersonalizing multi-channel user flows, right-in time targeting and\nanalytics while seamlessly scaling to billions of page impression. It\nis currently tailored to the needs of content providers, but of course\nnot limited to.\n\n - The platform’s architecture is based on four main layers:\n - Proxy/Distribution -- OpenResty/LUA for dynamic request forwarding\n - RESTful API -- several Python applications written using Pyramid\nweb framework running under uWSGI server, which serve as an\nintegration point for third party systems;\n - Analytics -- Python API for Big Data querying and distributed\nworkers performing heavy data collection.\n - In-memory Engine -- CeleraOne’s NoSql database which provides both\ndata storage and fast business logic.\n\nIn the talk I would like to give insights on how we use Python in the\narchitecture, which tools and technologies were chosen, and share\nexperiences deploying and running the system in production."
