recordingDate: 1425915190
description: "BY: MATTHEW BEALE\n\nJavaScript is a language awakening from long slumber. Browser vendors have already adopted many features from the ES6 specification ahead of its formal release in 2015, and even implemented some of the early ES7 draft specification. \n\nEmber, to help us build apps today, has provided its own version of many ES6 and ES7 features. As the drafts become specs and browsers add new capabilities, the framework will need to reconfigure itself around them.\n\nHow well does Ember align with these new APIs? Where the framework differs, what might be a path forward?\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GO1R/"
