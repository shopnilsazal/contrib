title: 'Wicked Good Ruby 2013 - RubyMotion under the Hood By Joshua Ballanco'
recordingDate: 1383149093
description: "By Joshua Ballanco\n\nBy now you probably know that RubyMotion is a new toolchain that lets you use familiar Ruby techniques to develop applications for iOS... but do you know what makes it tick? How is RubyMotion different from toolchains such as PhoneGap or Titanium? What does it mean to say that RubyMotion is implemented \"on top of the Objective-C runtime\"? And how the heck do I debug RubyMotion anyway?\n\nI will attempt to answer these questions, and more, by looking deep into the underpinnings of RubyMotion. Along the way, I'll give a bit of an overview of the history of RubyMotion, and maybe even a glimpse at its future.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG7H/"
