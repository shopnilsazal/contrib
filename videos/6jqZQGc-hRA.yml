title: 'Julia Nguyen - Two Households, Both Alike in Dignity: A Not-So-Tragedy of Refactoring Front-end APIs'
recordingDate: 1498043048
description: "Abstract\nIt can feel like a Shakespearean tragedy having to deal with technical debt when starting feature work - especially when the debt was accrued from a pair of star-crossed lovers - two teams working in parallel. Based on her recent work adding Apple Pay support to perk itemization at Indiegogo, Julia Nguyen will be talking about accounting for technical debt in feature work and best practices in refactoring front-end APIs.\n\nBio\nJulia Nguyen is a software engineer, writer, and Prompt speaker from Toronto. Julia is the founder of if me, an open source mental health communication app. She organized mentorship initiatives at the University of Waterloo Women in Computer Science Undergraduate Committee. She is the lead organizer of Southeast Asian Ladies in Tech, and organizes meetups for the San Francisco chapter of Write/Speak/Code."
