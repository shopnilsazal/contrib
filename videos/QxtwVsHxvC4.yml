By Kiran Bhattaram \n\nI have a cursed operating systems textbook --- each chapter I read unearths a new bug in the systems I work on. Come hear my tales of woe:\n\nthe chapter on kernel data structures that conjured up memory leaks INSIDE THE KERNEL!\nthe catastrophic slowdown caused by the syscalls chapter, narrowly averted by the magic of strace!\nthe networking chapter and the 200ms slowdown in EVERY network call we were making!\nAND MORE!\nAlong our journey, we'll acquire some fantastic operating systems tools and incantations you can use to vanquish even the scariest bugs!"
