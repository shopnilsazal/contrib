Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nTSDB: The Past, Present and the Future - Goutham Veeramachaneni, IIT Hyderabad (Advanced Skill Level)\n\nTSDB is the storage engine that powers Prometheus 2.0 and brought most of the drastic improvements in speed and utilization across the board. But it is also a golang library that Prometheus imports and is a solid time-series database that anyone can use. It is undergoing active development and this talk will take you the journey, benchmarks, new features, ghastly bugs and moonshot ideas. This will also help the audience understand the library and hopefully get them to use and contribute to it.\n\nAbout Goutham\nGoutham is a student and a developer from India. His enthusiasm for Ops got him an internship on the infra team of a large company where he worked on Production infrastructure and built the company's monitoring system on top of Prometheus. That was his first encounter with production systems and Prometheus, and last summer, he started contributing to Prometheus and interned with CoreOS, working on Prometheus' new storage engine. He is now a maintainer for TSDB, the engine behind Prometheus 2.0."
