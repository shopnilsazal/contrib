description: 'You’re going to mess up. Probably really terribly. The site’s going to crash. Or get hacked. Or you’re going to accidentally drop the database. Or enable email delivery on staging servers. Something bad is going to happen, eventually, whether you messed up or not. This talk is a talk about mistakes made by companies like GitHub, GitLab, and others, and how you and your team can address them when they pop up.'
