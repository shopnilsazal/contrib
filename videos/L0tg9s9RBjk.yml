description: "Matt Ryanczak - Implementing IPv6 at ARIN\nMatt Ryanczak, Network Operations Manager at the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN), began deploying IPv6 in production in 2003.

ARIN would like to share its IPv6 deployment experiences with you and relay our knowledge of other production IPv6 deployments to help you get a jump start on your own efforts.\n\nMatt will talk in detail about ARIN's deployment, to include information about provider communications, hardware, and software issues. Matt will also address security-related concerns related to IPv6 deployment.\n\nMatt Ryanczak is the Network Operations Manager for the American Registry for Internet Numbers, the nonprofit corporation that manages the distribution of all Internet number resources, including IPv4, IPv6, and ASNs.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
