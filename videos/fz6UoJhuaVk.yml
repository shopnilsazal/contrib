description: "by Bilgin Ibryam\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nKubernetes is awesome! But what does it takes for a Java developer to design,implement and run Cloud Native applications? In this session, we will look atKubernetes from a user point of view and demonstrate how to consume iteffectively. We will discover which concerns Kubernetes addresses and how ithelps to develop highly scalable and resilient Java applications.\n\nIn more details, we will explore the following patterns and principles:\n\n  * Containerizing Applications  * Interacting with Kubernetes  * Observable Interior  * Life Cycle Conformance  * Dynamic Placement  * Declarative Deployment  * Centralized Configurations  * Service Discovery & Load Balancing  * Scheduled Batch Job  * Singleton Service  * Resiliency with Kubernetes\n\n\nRoom: UA2.220 (Guillissen)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 11:55:00"
