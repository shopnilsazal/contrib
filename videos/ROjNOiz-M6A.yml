description: "by Keith Packard\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe Machine is a hardware project at Hewlett Packard Enterprise which takes anew look at computer architecture. With many processors and large amounts ofdirectly addressable storage, The Machine program has offered an equally largeopportunity for developing new system software. Our team at HPE has spent thebetter part of two years writing new software and adapting existing softwareto expose the capabilities of the hardware to application developers.\n\nTaking off from my presentation at LCA 2016, this presentation will explorethe changes we've made throughout the Linux environment, from securityinfrastructure to new file systems.\n\nAs directly addressable storage is such a large part of the new hardware, thispresentation will focus on a couple of important bits of free software whichexpose that to applications, including our Librarian File System and ManagedData Structures libraries.\n\nManaged Data Structures introduces a new application programming paradigmwhere the application works directly on the stable storage form for datastructures, eliminating serialization and de-serialization operations.\n\nFinally, the presentation will describe how the hardware is managed, fromsequencing power to a rack full of high-performance computing hardware,through constructing custom Linux operating systems for each processor andmanaging all of them as parts of a single computing platform.\n\n\nRoom: K.1.105 (La Fontaine)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:00:00"
