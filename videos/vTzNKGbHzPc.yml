description: "Leveled is a pure Erlang Key-Value store, designed specifically as a new backend for Riak KV. Originally started as a personal project, itâ€™s now ready to be used in the real world.\n\nAll backends for Riak KV have limitations: Bitcask has only partial feature support (in particular not supporting secondary indexes, which may also mean it can never support certain CRDT optimisations), leveldb requires a context switch form Erlang to C++ and suffers from side effects from write amplification if you have non-trivial value sizes."
