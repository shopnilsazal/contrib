description: "Quiet and Versatile Rubyist: Using the Tools You've Got by Alex Coles\n\nThere are times when we can work with the technologies we love. And there are times when we have to work with WebSphere and Oracle. The virtues of being opinionated have been extolled since the inception of the Rails framework back in 2005.
