Use canvas + javascript\r\n\r\nOption 1 is often the best unless you need some level of interactivity at which point you're stuck with choosing between flash that has problems with focus on linux, and has never been a favourite of FOSS developers, or using canvas + javascript with incomplete support for Internet Explorer through excanvas.  YUI-flot follows option 3.\r\n\r\nYUI-flot came about as an attempt to bring the popular flot plugin for jQuery into the hands of YUI developers, and in this talk, I'll cover a little bit about what you can do with YUI-Flot, and a little more about what I learnt while developing it.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
