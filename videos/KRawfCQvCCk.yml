description: "Jyrki Pulliainen - Packaging in packaging: dh-virtualenv\n[EuroPython 2014]\n[24 July 2014]\n\nDeploying your software can become a tricky task, regardless of the\nlanguage. In the spirit of the Python conferences, every conference\nneeds at least one packaging talk.\nThis talk is about dh-virtualenv. It's a Python packaging tool aimed\nfor Debian-based systems and for deployment flows that already take\nadvantage of Debian packaging with Python virtualenvs\n\n-----\n\n[Dh-virtualenv][1] is an open source tool developed at Spotify. We use it\nto ease deploying our Python software to production. We built dh-virtualenv as a tool that fits our existing continuous integration flow with a dedicated sbuild server.\nAs we were already packaging software in Debian packages, the\naim of dh-virtualenv was to make transition to virtualenv based installations as smooth as possible.\n\nThis talk covers how you can use dh-virtualenv to help you deploy your\nsoftware to production, where you are already running a Debian-based system, such as Ubuntu, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of the approach over other existing and\npopular techniques. We will discuss the deploying as a problem in\ngeneral, look into building a dh-vritualenv-backed package, and in the\nend, look into how dh-virtualenv was actually made.\n\nGoal is that after this presentation you know how to make your Debian/Ubuntu deployments easier!\n\n[dh-virtualenv][1] if fully open sourced, production tested software,\nlicensed under GPLv2+ and available in Debian testing and unstable.\n\nMore information of it is also available in our [blogpost][2].\n\n\nTalk outline:\n\n1. Introduction & overview (3min)\n    * Who am I?\n    * Why am I fiddling with Python packaging?\n    * What do you get out of this talk?\n2.  Different shortcomings of Python deployments (5min)\n    * Native system packages\n    * Virtualenv based installations\n    * Containers, virtual machine images\n3. dh-virtualenv (10 min)\n    * What is dh-virtualenv?\n    * Thought behind dh-virtualenv\n    * Advantages over others\n    * Requirements for your deployment flow\n    * Short intro to packaging Sentry with dh-virtualenv\n4. How is it built? (10 min)\n    * Debian package building flow primer\n    * How dh-virtualenv fits that flow\n    * What does it do build time and why?\n\n[1]:http://github.com/spotify/dh-virtualenv\n[2]:http://labs.spotify.com/2013/10/10/packaging-in-your-packaging-dh-virtualenv/"
