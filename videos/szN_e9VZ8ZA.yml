description: "Cloud Native Logging 101 [B] - Eduardo Silva, Treasure Data\n\nIn the Cloud Native Era logging is a fundamental piece of the instrumentation life cycle. With applications running as micro services the log information generated is much more and understanding how to implement and manage logging with this new architecture is fundamental.\n\nThis 101 presentation will introduce the concepts of log processing (end-to-end) applied to applications running in orchestrated environments managed by Kubernetes (live demos included).\n\nAbout Eduardo Silva\nEduardo is an Open Source Engineer at Treasure Data. He currently leads the efforts to make logging more scalable in Containerized and Orchestrated systems such as Kubernetes."
