description: "Building and testing is a great use case for containers, both due to the dynamic and isolation aspects. We will show how to run Jenkins at scale on Kubernetes and create Continuous Deployment pipelines.\n\nJenkins is an example of an application that can take advantage of Kubernetes technology to run Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery workloads. Jenkins and Kubernetes can be integrated to transparently use on demand containers to run build agents and jobs, and isolate job execution. It also supports CI/CD-as-code using Jenkins Pipelines and automated deployments to Kubernetes clusters. The presentation will allow a better understanding of how to use Jenkins on Kubernetes for container based, totally dynamic, large scale CI and CD."
