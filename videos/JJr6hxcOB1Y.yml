description: "Is Your Android App Secure?\n\nSam Bowne, Instructor, City College San Francisco\n\nIt's easy to audit Android app security, and very important, because most of them have one or more of the OWASP Mobile Top Ten Risks. I tested the top ten US bank apps, stock trading apps, and insurance apps, and 70% of them were insecure. I'll demonstrate how to find SSL validation failures and how to add Trojans to vulnerable apps to create a Proof-of-Concept. Complete instructions for all these tests are available free at https://samsclass.info/.\n\nSam Bowne (Twitter: @sambowne) Sam has been teaching computer networking and security classes at CCSF since 2000. He has given talks at DEFCON, HOPE, BayThreat, LayerOne, and Toorcon, and taught classes and many other schools and teaching conferences. He has these things: BS, PhD, CEH, CISSP, WCNA, and a lot of T-shirts."
