title: 'What Django can learn from Twisted by Amber "Hawkie" Brown'
recordingDate: 1438658610
description: "Web frameworks like Django are designed around the traditional request-response cycle — a request comes in, a response is generated, and that is delivered to the client. In the day of “single page” applications, where only sections of the page are updated through requests, doing real-time can be clunky. Twisted, and things that build off it, like Django Channels, might be worth thinking about, and this is what this talk will be about.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nJuly 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
