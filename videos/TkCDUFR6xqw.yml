description: "Welcome to Kubernetes - Introduction and Toolkit for Getting Started with Kubernetes [B] - Guinevere Saenger, Samsung SDS\n\nThis talk will focus on the beginning Kubernetes user by providing a basic introduction with explanations and example use cases. The presenter is herself a newcomer to Kubernetes and is thus uniquely placed to present information from a beginnerâ€™s perspective and share her personal strategies for success. Specific examples include: how to find mentors; how to find answers when the docs are confusing; how to get involved with local Kubernetes groups; and finding the best online learning tools. Attendees who are fairly new to tech itself or entered tech through non-traditional ways are especially encouraged to attend in order to add to their toolbox of resources.\n\nAbout Guinevere Saenger\nIn 2016, Guinevere Saenger transitioned from being a full-time professional pianist to a career in tech. To do so, she obtained a spot at the highly competitive Ada Developers Academy in Seattle, a year-long, tuition-free, bootcamp-style software development training program for women and nonbinary people making a mid-life career switch into tech. As part of her training, Guinevere interned at Samsung SDS on the Cloud Native Computing Team, where, after graduating in July 2017, she accepted a full-time software engineer position working on Kubernetes deployment tools such as Kraken. Making her home in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, Guinevere enjoys music, food, and the outdoors."
