description: "PyCon Canada 2015: https://2015.pycon.ca/en/schedule/43/\n\nTalk Description:\nCurrent networks don't have the ability to provision network services quickly and easily.\nWe need rapid provisioning of network services to virtual machines in a data center environment and improve network visibility and reduced operational costs. \n\nSoftware-Defined Networking is a way to start building a more open and dynamic network. It means a network can ramp up or ramp down network resources and adapt to sharp, unpredictable spikes in demand much easier than traditional networks. \n\nTo implement SDN, we use Opendaylight and Mininet (a python library) to rapidly prototype our network and create proof of concepts capable of being demonstrated and proved easily."
