description: "Library design is often all about API design and in Haskell effectful APIs are usually structured as monads or applicative functors. This talk/workshop uses the vehicle of designing a simple effectful library API to explore the differences between power afforded to library implementors and library users when choosing an applicative or monadic design. The API is described denotatively, the denotation guides the implementation, and then various implementations are compared. Finally, the shared structure will be extracted and the choice of applicative or monad highlighted via the use of free structures.\n\nJoseph has a background in biomedical engineering, statistics, and signal processing. He is a self taught functional programmer and entrepreneur currently working on a small company in the space of clinical research operations. His programming interests revolve around the divide between building great products and the mathematical structure that gives them form.\n\nFor more on Lambda Jam, visit http://www.lambdajam.com"
