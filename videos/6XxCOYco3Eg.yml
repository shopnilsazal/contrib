description: 'You might never find the need to sandbox ruby, but trying to sandbox ruby is fun. We get to dive deep into the internals of Ruby and learn all the ways running ruby code securely can fail. We''ll walk through some different approaches and how they can be broken: - REGEX to the Rescue - Threads and $SAFE - JRuby/MacRuby Sandbox - RubyCop -- A ruby static analyzer And after surveying the sandbox scene we''ll draw some conclusions on how to mitigate potential sandbox failures and how Ruby itself can change to make really sandboxing Ruby a reality.'
