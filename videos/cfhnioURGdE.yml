description: "Containerd: The Universal Container Runtime [I] - Justin Cormack, Docker\n\nContainerd is a new community project designed to provide a common runtime for every project that uses containers: Kubernetes, Docker, Amazon ECS, Azure Container Engine and many more, with contributors coming from Docker, Google, Red Hat, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Alibaba and many more companies in the container space. It extends the collaboration on standards around the Open Container Initiative by implementing these standards, and is run by an independent foundation. This project will be a central point of collaboration between the diverse container community and an integration point for vendors, much like the Linux kernel project is.\n\nAlthough containerd was designed to be a \"boring infrastructure\" component that just sits there and works for a huge range of use cases, it is a pretty exciting development for those of us involved in containers. This talk covers the state of the project now, the roadmap, how it fits into broader tools such as Docker and Kubernetes, how it will affect users, and the future roadmap. It is an open project which is seeking a wide range of input, so the talk covers how to get involved and contribute.\n\nAbout Justin Cormack\nJustin Cormack is an engineer at Docker and a maintainer of the Docker engine."
