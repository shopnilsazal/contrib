title: 'GeeCON Prague 2017: Todd Montgomery - Making It Count: Quality is Not Optional'
recordingDate: 1516816639
description: 'All too often quality comes along as an afterthought to the software systems we build. Sometimes quality is not even a concern at all. However, increasingly our systems have to be right the first time. Software is hard to design and implement. Let alone design and implement well. What can we do to be better at designing and delivering better software and systems? Does language choice, such as Java vs. C++ vs. C vs. Erlang really matter in terms of producing quality software? Can you actually produce quality systems on budget and on time? In this session, we will discuss lessons learned from almost a decade of working on NASA software projects that had to work correctly or people could die. And how these lessons continue to impact the speakers mindset and outlook on a daily basis.'
