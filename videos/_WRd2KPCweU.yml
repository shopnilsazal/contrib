description: "Topic of the talk: \nReclaiming control! Negotiations on the places of mobile technology in daily life\n\nNetworked digital devices have become fundamentally intertwined in people’s daily lives. This talk presents results from a case study that examined how the softwarization of everyday life is experienced by users who describe their relation to their devices as intense. The research design consisted of media diaries and trackers installed in participants’ smartphones and computers. These were used as stimuli in the interviews to enable reflection on the role of ICTs in daily life. Results show how the complex intertwinement of digital devices and applications in the everyday evokes manifold feelings. Simultaneously, technology is perceived as an aid in organizing and managing the everyday, but it also induces feelings of losing control, chaos, and burden. It is presented how users actively negotiate their relation to devices and applications based on these feelings.\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018.
