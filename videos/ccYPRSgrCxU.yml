description: "Async Everything  by: Anthony Eden\n\nOne of the best ways to make applications perform well is to develop them to handle things in parallel and asynchronously. From parallel processing to asynchronous IO, when you need an application to perform well you need to think asynchronously. This talk will cover various means of parallel processing and asynchronous communication available to Ruby applications such as threading, using multiple processors and non-blocking IO. It will also cover libraries built to support asynchronous execution such as Resque and EventMachine."
