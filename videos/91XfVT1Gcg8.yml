In this hilarious talk, Corey delves into the details of how the AWS bill goes from a few cents an hour into something suspiciously reminiscent of a phone number.\n\nFrom low hanging fruit to weird Amazon billing gotchas, this talk serves as a survey of all of the sharp edges around Amazon's least understood productâ€”its ridiculous monthly bill.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
