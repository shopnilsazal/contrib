It is because the malicious practice of social engineering is different between in Japan and the U.S. I think it is true. Since I have the both experience of being the company in Japan and the U.S., I would like to consider various technique of social engineering from both cultural glasses, such as tailgating, phishing or vishing method. In my talk, I would like to discuss the workability of several social engineering techniques from both Japanese and U.S. culture. It will support the cultural difference can become the barrier or vulnerable weakness\n\nBIO:\nTomohisa Ishikawa is a Japanese IT security consultant with seven years of experience.
