description: "Valerio Maggio - Traversing Mazes the pythonic way and other Algorithmic Adventures\n[EuroPython 2014]\n[22 July 2014]\n\nGraphs define a powerful mental (and mathematical) model of structure, \nrepresenting the building blocks of formulations and/or solutions \nfor many hard problems. In this talk, graphs and (some of the) main \ngraph-related algorithms will be analysed from a very pythonic angle:\nthe Zen of Python (e.g., beautiful is better than ugly, \nsimple is better than complex, readability counts)."
