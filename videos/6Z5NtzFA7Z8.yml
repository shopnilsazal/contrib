description: "You are predictable. Your passwords are predictable, and so are your PINs. This fact is being used by the hackers, as well as the agencies watching you. But what about your Android lock patterns? Can who you are reveal what patterns you create?\n\nThis presentation will present the result from an analysis of 3400 user-selected patterns. The interesting part is that we collected additional information about the respondents, not just the patterns themselves.\n\nWill being left-handed and having experience with security affect the way you create your lock patterns? There are 389,112 possible patterns. Your full device encryption won't save you if your lock pattern is L - as in \"loser\".\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nMarte has just finished her master degree in computer science at the Norwegian University of Technology and Science and has discovered the beauty of security.\n\nShe likes passwords and colors, resulting in a special interest in graphical passwords. She is probably the only person that has survived after studying the Android Pattern Lock for a whole year."
