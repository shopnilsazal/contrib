description: "PyCon Canada 2015: https://2015.pycon.ca/en/schedule/68/\n\nTalk Description:\nOver Python's long history it has collected a large number of implementations, both active and abandoned (Wikipedia lists 10 implementations alone.) Brett will go over the actively maintained implementations of Python, what makes them unique, and end with an unscientific performance comparison (both Python 2 & 3 interpreters.)\n\n# Actively maintained interpreters\n\n * CPython \n * PyPy\n * IronPython\n * Jython\n\n# Interpreters under development\n\n * Skython?\n * Pyston\n * Pyjion\n\n# Other ways to get a performance boost\n\n * Numba\n * Cython\n\n# Performance comparison\n\nAn exploration of performance using CPython's benchmark suite https://hg.python.org/benchmarks. Data will be made publicly available through a Jupyter notebook."
