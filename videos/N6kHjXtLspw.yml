title: 'Realtime web applications with streaming REST by Brad Gessler'
recordingDate: 1339910194
description: "As more people collaborate on the web with your applications, its not enough to just persist data to the database; it needs to be pushed out to your users web browsers so that they're always working with the freshest data.\n\nIn this session, Brad will show how to build a real-time layer on top of an existing Rails application's authorization and resource logic so that you can build on top of the hard work already invested in your Rails application.\n\nTopics that will be discussed include:\n\nWhy I didn't choose Socket.IO Stream application resources into Backbone.js models to keep data fresh Hook into ActiveRecord to push representations of data into a message queue Message queue naming conventions public/private resource streams Exposing message queues to HTTP Securing streams with existing application authorization logic Considerations for streaming in a production environment"
