description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2017 by David Fournier, Smart & Soft.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-6\n\nAnnounced in 2014, Android Auto was the Google response to Apple CarPlay. It was however complicated for a developer to make Android Auto apps as the development tools were scarce and not really adapted.\nWith the release of Android Auto 2.0 in November 2016, the developer has now a fully functional testing platform with Google releasing an Android Auto simulator and an Android mobile app. This new version has encouraged a growing number of constructors to include Android Auto devices in their cars, and it becomes more appealing to start developing apps for this platform, either specifically or as a spin-off of an already existing app.\n\nIn this session of live coding, we will show how to use the Android Auto SDK to make a small application capable of playing songs and live streams, controllable with touch commands or the user voice. We will show what are the good practices, the functionalities and limits of the SDK while giving the opportunity for attendants to have a quick look of the possibilities offered Android Auto.\nA Github repository containing the code written during the presentation will be available at the end of it.\n\nType: Android development\nExperience: intermediate\n\nAlex Karp Production"
