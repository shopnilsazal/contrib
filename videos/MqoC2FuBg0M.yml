recordingDate: 1530100237
description: "Further information: https://foss-backstage.de/session/evolving-kde-how-we-figured-out-what-we-want-do-together\n\nKDE was founded more than 20 years ago, making it one of the longest-living free software projects. KDE started out creating a desktop for Linux. Over those years the world around KDE has changed rapidly - new devices, different expectations from our users, more and more things happening in the cloud. The good old desktop alone wasn't going to keep us relevant anymore and you could see it in the community. We became more splintered and demotivated while the need for free software for people's day-to-day work grew and grew.\n\nIn this talk I'd like to take you through our long but rewarding efforts of figuring out our place and strategy in a new world and how we did this collaboratively with the whole community."
