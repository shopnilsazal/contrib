description: "Quick and easy browser testing using RSpec and Rails 5.1 by Sam Phippen\n\nTraditionally doing a full stack test of a Rails app with RSpec has been problematic. The browser wouldn't automate, capybara configuration would be a nightmare, and cleaning up your DB was difficult. In Rails 5.1 the new 'system test' type was added to address this. With modern RSpec and Rails, testing every part of your stack including Javascript from a browser is now a breeze.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn about the new system specs in RSpec, how to set them up, and what benefits they provide. If you want to improve your RSpec suite with full stack testing this talk is for you!"
