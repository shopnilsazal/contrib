description: "Automation and DevOps have changed the way organizations deliver products. The shift towards DevOps made it pretty clear that companies are adopting this organizational model in order to facilitate a practice of automated software deployment. While the traditional idea of a 'software release' dissolves away into a continuous cycle of service and delivery improvements, organizations find that their traditional application security solutions are having a hard time to adapt to the new process and security becomes an inhibitor to the complete process. In this session, you'll learn how organizations adopted security into DevOps processes.\n\nJoin us to:\n- Discover which obstacles should be expected and how to overcome them\n- Understand what functionality is key to enable real automation of your AppSec program\n- Explore the benefits of having security as part of your DevOps automation (what's in it for me?)\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
