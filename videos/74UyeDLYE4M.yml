title: 'Linkerd Service Mesh in Production: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt'
recordingDate: 1527706341
description: 'Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH) has transitioned from a publisher best known for its textbook printing business into a global leader in education technology. But to do so, HMH had to evolve its infrastructure from monolithic to microservices-based architecture and give its development teams a reliable, scalable, and performant IaaS to build on. In this webinar, Robert Allen, Director of Engineering at HMH, will share how Linkerd helps them solve for service discovery, reliable failovers, telemetry, and real time provisioning in its cloud native environment, and enables its developers to make blue-green deployments for continuous application delivery.'
