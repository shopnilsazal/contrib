description: "Can you tell the difference between good and bad code? What do you base your judgment on?\n\nOver the years, the Ruby community has built a fairly strong notion of \"the right way\" of writing code. During his thought provoking presentation, Matt will show that things are not simply good vs bad, and that what we call \"pretty\" code might, in fact, just be lipstick on a pig.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG7E/"
