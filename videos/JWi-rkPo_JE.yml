description: "by John Darrington\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThe guile implementation of scheme provides a Turing complete languageenabling any computable problem to be solved. In the community however thereis a perception that scheme is not suited to user interface applications. Thistalk discusses why that perception exists, and aims to counter it bypresenting an example of graphical user interface application using guile-ncurses which may be used to configure and install the GuixSD operating systemon a bare computer.\n\nThe structure of the program will be briefly presented, how it uses the guile-ncurses library and issues which were encountered during its development\n\n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 10:00:00"
