description: "AppSec California 2015 - Day 1, Track 1, Slot 2\n\nTitle\n\n.NET Reversing and Exploitation for Cool Kids\n\nAbstract\n\nJava isn’t the only managed language with bugs. This talk will cover the current state of .NET reverse engineering and exploitation, including practical examples of both application-level and framework vulnerabilities. We’ll cover the various strengths and weaknesses of .NET security features, including bypassing strong-name signing including the GAC. Finally, I will provide a short demo on how to modify the behavior of the .NET framework through DLL byte patching.\n\nBio\n\nKelly Lum has “officially” worked in Information Security since 2003. She recently left an eight-year stint as a code auditor/ penetration tester/ application security director/ bad-ass M.C. in the financial security sector to become a Security Engineer at Tumblr.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
