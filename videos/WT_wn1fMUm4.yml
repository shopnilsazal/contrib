recordingDate: 1502694960
description: 'Graphic processing units (GPUs) are not just for playing games. They play a huge role in accelerating applications that have a large number of parallelizable tasks such as machine learning, data analysis or similar. Learn how Java can exploit the power of GPUs to optimize high-performance computing applications, through both explicit GPU programming and letting the Java JIT compiler transparently off-load work to the GPU. This presentation covers the principles and considerations for GPU programming from Java and looks at the software stack and developer tools available. From laptops to the cloud GPUs are turning up everywhere. After this talk you will be ready to extract the full power of these GPUs from your own application.'
