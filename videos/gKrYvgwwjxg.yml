description: "Better than Life - Manipulation of The Human Brain With The Use of Machines\n\nJust as the understanding of the human genome will soon allow us to control the essential physical processes that create our bodies, knowledge in the manipulation of the human brain with the use of machines will give us the ability to reconstruct ourselves mentally in a way that has only been imagined by the most outlandish of science fiction writers.\n\nThis speech will take you through the history of altered states, from ritual and religion, to drugs and chemicals right through to the future of the technology. You will be introduced to some of the mechanical tools that have existed for years that have only be talked about and affordable by a few. As well as showing you how to build your own home-brew mind machine‚ the presentation also will also be discussing other brain manipulating technologies.\n\nNe0nRa1n has been involved in the computer underground for a decade and is also a world traveler and slacker extraordinaire. In her pursuit to understand how brain waves work, she has spent extensive time in a Buddhist hermitage where she was able to experience meditation first hand. Among her current projects is her quest to find a way to replace expensive chemical antidepressants with affordable Œdigital drugs.\n\nSeveral years back, Jon McClintock received a Computer Science degree from a university of no consequence. Since then, he's bounced back and forth several times between enterprise and embedded software development. Equally comfortable debugging 8-bit microcontrollers using a logic analyser as he is developing highly available, multi-tier applications, Jon enjoys manipulating minds both large and small."
