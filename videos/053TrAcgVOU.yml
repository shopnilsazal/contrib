description: "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#HITB2012KUL (OCT 10-11) REGISTRATION NOW OPEN\nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/ \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPresentation Materials: http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012ams/materials/ \n\nAfter very successful \"Hacking printers for fun and profit\" series of talks, I have decided to continue the research onto PostScript realms -- an old, very powerful and nicely designed programming language, where (as a coincidence or not, given it's numerous security flaws) Adobe owns most PostScript interpreters instances.\n\nThis talk will cover a mix of overlapping areas like:\n\n    Reverse Engineering\n    Embedded Device Security\n    Unconventional Malware\n\nABOUT ANDREI COSTIN\n\nBorn and raised in Moldova, Andrei is a Computer Science graduate of the Politechnic University of Bucharest where he did his thesis work in Biometrics and Image Processing. He is the author of the MiFare Classic Universal toolKit (MFCUK), the first publically available (FOSS) card-only key cracking tool for the MiFare Classic RFID card family.\n\nWhile starting out his IT-career in the Computer Games industry, he has worked in the Telecom field and is currently senior developer at a specialized firm producing custom embedded systems utilizing GSM/UMTS/GPS technologies. He is passionate about IT/App/Info security and has spoken at various security conferences. He usually doesn't have too much free time, but when he does he simply enjoys the Cyprus' shores and sea."
