description: "JavaScript engines - how do they even?\n\nWant to know how JavaScript engines work? Why is JavaScript so fast? What is just-in-time compilation? We’ll look at basic concepts of compilers, challenges posed by modern JavaScript, and how to write compiler-friendly JavaScript.\n\nFranziska Hinkelmann\nFranziska has a Ph.D. in mathematics and is a software engineer on Google’s V8 team. She's an expert on ES6 performance and a Node.js core collaborator. \n\nWhen she's not working hard on making JavaScript and Node faster, she's probably out horseback riding."
