description: "Abstract\nWhile programmers tend to divide themselves into communities along language or paradigm lines, the reality is that the OO and FP communities have a great deal to learn from each other. As developers, we should learn classic OO, learn classical FP, and then strive to rise above them both.\n\nBio\nBrian Goetz is the Java Language Architect at Oracle Corporation, and was the specification lead for JSR-335 (Lambda Expressions for the Java Programming Language.) He is the author of the best-selling Java Concurrency in Practice, as well as over 75 articles on Java development, and has been fascinated by programming since Jimmy Carter was President."
