language: English
recordingDate: 1478816894
description: "Electronic locks are becoming increasingly common on consumer-grade safes, particularly those used to secure guns. This talk explores vulnerabilities of several UL-listed Type 1 \"High Security\" electronic safe locks. Using side-channel attacks, we recover the owner-configured keycodes on two models of these locks from outside of locked safes without any damage to the locks or safes. Discussion includes power-line analysis, timing attacks, and lockout-defeat strategies on embedded devices.\n\nBio:\nAn embedded software developer with a background in electrical engineering, Plore has long been fascinated by computer security and locks. One day he found himself wondering if the trust bestowed on electronic locks was actually misplaced. He decided to investigate."
