description: 'In this talk, we will explore how developers new to functional languages tend to gravitate towards old patterns, and the new patterns they can learn to replace these with. To give this context, we will review how one functional newbie converted an existing Rails application to Phoenix. The goal of this talk is to give a perspective of a newcomer to the Elixir of today.'
