In the face of clear & present threats to \"Body, Mind & Soul\" it was clear: The Cavalry Isn't Coming... it falls to us... the willing & able... and we have to try to have impact. Over the past year, the initiative reduced its focus and increased its momentum. With a focus on public safety & human life we did our best \"Collecting, Connecting, Collaborating\" to ensure the safer technology dependence in: Medical, Automotive, Home Electronics & Public Infrastructure. We will update the DEF CON hearts & minds with lessons learned from our workshops & experiments, successes & failures, and momentum in industry and with public policy makers. Year[0] was encouraging. Year[1] will require more structure and transparency if we are to rise to these challenges... As a year of experimentation comes to an end, we will share where we've been, take our licks, and more importantly outline a path forward...\n\nJoshua Corman is the Chief Technology Officer for Sonatype.
