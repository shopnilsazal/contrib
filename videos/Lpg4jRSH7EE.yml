This is a talk about how to make junior engineers into independent and productive members of your engineering team faster and cheaper by outlining a plan for how to onboard engineers effectively based on data and anecdotes gathered from companies in San Francisco.\n\nI am a web applications developer from the bay area who builds full-stack web applications. I got my MSCS at Stanford but did my undergrad degree in Communication. I am active in the community with organizations like Hackbright Academy, PyLadies, and Girl Geek Dinners.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1T/"
