title: 'Cisco''s Devnet Goes Cloud Native: A Case Study on Transforming to Cloud Native [I] - Matt Johnson'

description: "Cisco's Devnet Goes Cloud Native: A Case Study on Transforming to Cloud Native [I] - Matt Johnson, Cisco\n\nDevNet is Cisco’s developer program through which external developers and partners interface, experiment and innovate using Cisco technologies, products and APIs. Devnet consists of technology innovations, software platforms, and tools needed to reach the full promise of the Software-Driven Enterprise. Our goal is to build the community of enterprise developers and innovators using DevNet’s key principles: Learn, Code, Inspire, and Connect. \n\nDevNet offers multiple services to developers. Content and API navigation via our developer-friendly portal, tailored learning labs that bring Cisco technologies and knowledge home for the developers, sandboxes that enable developers to interact with Cisco products and services in easy and cost effective ways and communities of interest that bring developers together around their main areas of interests.\n\nDevnet has been very successful and as a result, the architecture of the platform coupled with the software transformation that is occurring resulted in the cloudification of the devnet platform. At the core of the cloudification effort is the need to independently scale up the services to accommodate the growing pool of DevNet developers and to rapidly add more services to keep developers engaged and satisfied. Meeting these requirements in an architecture made of multiple monolithic services is expensive and slow. It was time to embark on our journey to transform our offerings into micro services.\n\nGoals of the project:\n- Create a high quality developer experience (learn, code, inspire, connect). This is the vision that we needed to set across the Devnet team, Cisco, and our external partners. Setting this vision and getting buy in across all levels of the organization is key.\n- Create a flexible and agile platform. With a clear vision and alignment, the next set is to execute on the new architecture and enable the flexibility and scalability requirements.\n- Make sure that our investment and resources are building and strengthening the platform. To accomplish this goal, we had to address process issues and invest in the right resources. This is critical to understand at the beginning of the effort and to plan to address and track progress against this important goal.\n- BU content onboarding as strategic and technical advantage. Since the hard work was accomplished in the first 3 goals, this fourth one was achieved as a matter of addressing these Bus early and getting not only their buyin but more importantly, co-development alignment.\n\nThis presentation will discuss the effort we completed in taking Devnet to production with Kubernetes, Prometheus, and monitoring enhancements required. The lessons learned and sample applications created in the developer.cisco.com learning labs will be presented.\n\nAbout Matt Johnson\nTechnical Leader & Developer Evangalist, Cisco"
