description: "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nRoyal FloraHolland is the biggest flower auction in the world. And next to handling a lot of plants and flowers, we also handle a lot of pictures of plants and flowers. Pictures that need to be of a certain quality. We built a fully automized self-improving system to check the image quality by using deep learning models, asynchronous API technologies and Docker/AWS/Gitlab.\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
