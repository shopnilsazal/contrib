description: "Highly Available Services During Maintenance Events - Maisem Ali & Eric Tune, Google\n\nMaintenance events occur and require taking down nodes for various reasons. Eric and Maisem talk about the best practices and lessons learned trying to minimize downtime during routine maintenance events.\n\nThey show how to use StatefulSets and PodDisruptionBudgets to achieve highly available services. They go on to explain what the best practices for performing node maintenance are using scenarios like failed pod evictions, non-responsive kubelets and network bisections.\n\nAbout Maisem Ali\nMaisem has been working on Kubernetes for the last two years. He has heavily contributed to upgradability and upgrade testing between Kubernetes versions, and primarily focuses on the Google Kubernetes Engine control plane\n\nAbout Eric Tune\nEric has worked on Kubernetes since before the first public release. He has contributed to Security, Tenancy, Application Controllers, Charts, Jobs, documentation, and more.
