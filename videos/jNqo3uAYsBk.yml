description: "What Mirai missed: \nMirai was elegantly simple; using default telnet credentials to compromise large numbers of devices. However, in the quest for simplicity, the author missed numerous more significant vulnerabilities. We have spent the last few months researching the security of more than 30 DVR brands and have made discoveries that make the Mirai telnet issue seem almost trivial by comparison. We discovered multiple vulnerabilities which we will share, including wormable remote code execution. We may also disclose a route to fix Mirai-compromised DVRs remotely. However, this method has the side effect of being usable by malicious actors to make Mirai persistent beyond a power off reboot. Further, we will show HOW and WHY we believe XiongMai is at the root cause of these issues, regardless of the DVR brand. Finally, we'll show examples of DVRs using the same base chipset as those vulnerable to Mirai, but doing security well. \nThe camera dildo: \nWhat started as a serious piece of research got hijacked by the press because it was “a bit rude”. The real story wasn’t just that it could be compromised, but the work that went into reverse engineering it to find hidden services, reused code (from a camera drone), and the command injection which can be used to compromise the video stream. \nSamsung smart fridge: \nRipping and analysing the firmware from a Tizen-running smart fridge’s BGA chip, what did we find?"
