description: "In this talk, I am going to briefly talk about \"what cloud is\" and highlight the various types of cloud (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). The bulk of the talk will be about using the fog gem using IaaS. I will discuss fog concepts (collections, models, requests, services, providers) and supporting these with actual examples using fog.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG8Z/"
