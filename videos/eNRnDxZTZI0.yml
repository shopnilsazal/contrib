Most of the use cases are big players that need to\nhandle huge amounts of data and automate complex infrastructures. But\nwhat about actually using it, for you as a developer, to deploy a\nsimple app? In my case, at least, that has not be an usual topic of\ndiscussion when talking about OpenStack. In this talk I'll introduce\nthe OpenStack Python SDK, a project relatively new in the OpenStack\necosystem, and show you step by step how to deploy your own web app\nusing different components in OpenStack."
