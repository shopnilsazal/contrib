description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nVitess and a Kubernetes Operator - Sugu Sougoumarane, YouTube (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nVitess is an open source project started by YouTube to help with scaling of its MySQL databases. It has now gained substantial adoption in the community, especially because it bridges the gap between MySQL and the cloud. This talk will cover the wide range of capabilities Vitess has. We will discuss some case studies of companies that have successfully launched on various Kubernetes environments in GKE and AWS. We will conclude with a demo of the newly-developed Kubernetes Operator for Vitess.\n\nAbout Sugu\nSugu is CTO at PlanetScale. He is also the lead developer and community leader of the Vitess open source project which he co-created at Youtube in 2010. Vitess has helped multiple companies scale MySQL massively. Prior to Vitess, he worked on various scaling and infrastructure projects at YouTube and at PayPal. Sugu is passionate about distributed systems and consensus algorithms. He publishes his ideas about these topics on his blog at http://ssougou.blogspot.com."
