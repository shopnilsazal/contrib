description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\nFriday, September 19 • 3:00pm - 3:45pm\n\nCloud Security at Scale and What it Means for Your Application\n \nCloud computing is all the rage, but few organizations have really thought about what security means for their applications and networks in cloud-centric deployments. Netflix is amongst the largest users of public cloud resources and consumes roughly 1/3 of all the US’s downstream broadband at peak. This talk will cover the processes used at Netflix to deploy and secure large-scale applications to the Cloud. Netflix has developed a suite of architectures, processes, and tools to make security in the Cloud as elegant as possible... most of these are, or will soon be, Open Sourced. Several tools will be previewed in the talk.\n\nThese systems include:\n- Hundreds of applications; with hundreds of production deployments a day ... all using an “immutable server model”\n- Crazy monkeys that roam the clouds to enforce availability models through random instance homicide\n- OCD fish that swim cloudy waters to make sure firewalls are sane and consistent across the globe\n- Inquisitive penguins automatically assess the risk of an application based upon its codebase and interconnections with other applications\n- ... and many more ...\n\n\nSpeaker\n\nBen Hagen\nEngineering Manager, Security Tools and Operations, Netflix\nBen Hagen is likely the only security professional in the world who has won both a presidential election and an Emmy. He loves security and both building and breaking things. Ben currently leads the Security Tools and Operations team at Netflix. During the 2012 US Presidential Election he was in charge of security for the Obama 2012 re-election campaign’s technology program.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
