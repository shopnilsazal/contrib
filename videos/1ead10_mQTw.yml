description: "This 2014 talk from Olivier Deriviere and John Kurlander provides insight into the creative process behind the soundtrack of Remember Me, from facing the challenge of convincing all concerned to take a chance on something so musically different from the standard cyberpunk-genre soundtrack, to distilling the sensation of the game's central theme of memory manipulation from a live orchestra, then seamlessly complementing the live instrumentations with electronic enhancements.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
