description: 'The Danganronpa series is known in Japan -- and increasingly in the West -- for its uniquely charming characters, to the point where each cast member has their own fan base. But behind this eclectic cast is a well-defined and structured process used to create every man, woman, and sociopathic animatronic bear. This session at GDC 2015 from Spike Chunsoft''s Kazutaka Kodaka explains the method and explore the principles behind making memorable game characters and stories.'
