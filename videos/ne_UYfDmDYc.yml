description: "In July 2017, Pinterest formed its first-ever dedicated web performance team. In this talk I will discuss how the performance team got off the ground, set goals, built tools, and made performance a priority at Pinterest.\n\nTopics will include building a regression testing and investigation framework, finding the biggest optimization wins in our codebase, making customized metrics decisions by relating performance to engagement, and understanding what performance tooling developers need."
