description: "We have hacked mruby on non-PC OS. At the RubyConf 2012, we will talk and share our experiences.\n\nOur talks have two parts (actually, we have two small talks)\n\nRuby + iOS = Super awesome!\nmruby for embedded systems\nFirst part (iOS):\nAre you fed up with Objective-C? Now, you can build iOS apps with mruby.\n\nMobiRuby aims to replace Objective-C/C/Java on mobile platforms with Ruby, just like you can use Lua or Mono to build apps on those platforms. In this presentation, I will talk about how to create iOS app using MobiRuby and MobiRuby internals.\n\nSecond part (RTOS):\nThe TOPPERS/ASP and TOPPERS/SSP (http://www.toppers.jp/en/) kernel is a famous RTOS in Japan, as extended and improved kernel for embedded systems, based on the standard profile of Micro ITRON4.0. We have used mruby on TOPPERS RTOS. We will show the issues about embedded systems and how to solve them.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGe9/"
