description: "Learning version control is a bit like learning how to play golf. Once you know the basics of hitting that teeny ball with a gigantic club it's all fun and games but then you get frustrated and throw your bag into the river.\n\nBut once you learn a little more than the basics, you end up realizing that you can drive a golf cart all over the course and that alone is pretty fun.\n\nThis talk is all about the bite-sized bits I've picked up after years of working at GitHub. It'll be fast-paced so you can pick it apart and take at least a couple specific things relevant to your workflow that will make you more productive.\n\nBring a golf club, just in case.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4b/"
