description: "Alexander Sibiryakov - Frontera: open source large-scale web crawling framework\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nIn this talk I'm going to introduce Scrapinghub's new open source\nframework [Frontera][1].  Frontera allows to build real-time\ndistributed web crawlers and website focused ones.\n\nOffering:\n\n - customizable URL metadata storage (RDBMS or Key-Value based),\n - crawling strategies management,\n - transport layer abstraction.\n - fetcher abstraction.\n\nAlong with framework description I'll demonstrate how to build a\ndistributed crawler using [Scrapy][2], Kafka and HBase, and hopefully\npresent some statistics of Spanish internet collected with newly built\ncrawler.  Happy EuroPythoning!\n\n[1]: https://github.com/scrapinghub/frontera\n[2]: http://scrapy.org/"
