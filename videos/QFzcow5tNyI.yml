title: 'Ethics, human rights and blockchain - Sebastian. Porsdam Mann - Codemotion Amsterdam 2018'
recordingDate: 1530191554
description: 'The philosophical study of the identification of the best possible options in any given case is known as ethics. Blockchain technologies can further good causes, but the insights of millennia of great thinkers can also be useful to the blockchain communities. In addition, the human right to enjoy the benefits of the progress of science and its applications and related rights are highly relevant for issues at the intersection of computing and society. This talk explores the synergy between ethics, human rights and blockchain technologies.'
