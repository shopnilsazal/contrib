description: "In this talk Florian Grunow wants to set the focus on some case studies. He doesn't focus too much on the vulnerabilities themselves but more on how the fixes got implemented and how they were able to bypass any mitigations again. The results provide lessons learned to the attendees to help avoid making errors in fixing common security vulnerabilities.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
