title: '#HITB2013AMS D1T1  Travis Goodspeed - Nifty Tricks and Sage Advice for Shellcode on Embedded Systems'
recordingDate: 1369000813
description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2013ams/materials/ \n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\n\nThis lecture presents a bunch of clever tricks that will save you time and headaches when writing exploits for small embedded systems, such as smart meters, thermostats, keyboards, and mice.\n\nYou'll learn how to write tiny shellcode that's quickly portable to any variant of ARM, as well as how to exploit memory corruption on an 8-bit micro that's incapable of executing RAM. You'll learn how to develop an embedded exploit without a debugger, and how to blindly assemble a ROP chain when you don't have a firmware image.\n\nNote: No machines harmed in this lecture had enough RAM to hold CALC.EXE.\n\nABOUT TRAVIS GOODSPEED\n\nTravis Goodspeed is a neighborly reverse engineer from Southern Appalachia, where he is rumored to keep a warehouse full of GoodFET boards and a nifty satellite dish. His prior projects include a dozen key-extraction exploits for Zigbee and WSN devices, bootloader exploits for microcontrollers, and the Facedancer, a tool for emulating USB hardware in Python."
