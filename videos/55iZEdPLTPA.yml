description: "Making a difference, right off the bat!  by: Ashish Dixit\n\nYou've landed a great opportunity to work with some of the smartest people in the industry. You can barely contain the enthusiasm to learn and contribute to the team. You may not have all the required technical skills on day 1, but you are confident that you will get there with the support from your team. It's exciting & stressful at the same time because you need to start contributing right away.\n\nA lot of developers find themselves in these shoes, just as I did in not-too-distant past. This talk offers specific strategies and tactics developers of all skill levels can use to start making an immediate impact. These strategies have enabled me to contribute quickly on a new team and I want to share it with you so that they can help you on each new project or team you work with.\n\nThe talk will primarily focus on:\n\n* Techniques for quickly learning a new codebase\n* Finding ways to have a significant impact quickly\n\nWhile this talk is from the perspective of someone new to the team, I feel that it will also help experienced developers better understand the mindset and needs of new team members necessary to help them onboard new developers quickly and effectively."
