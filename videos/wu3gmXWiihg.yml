description: "Ruby is almost synonymous with Open Source thanks to an amazing community. Managing a successful Open Source project requires maintaining a careful balance of pragmatism, exuberance, and patience.\n\nAs soon as you have your first contributor you have to begin to think about how to manage not just the code but also the people. There are no org charts or managers to lean on for assistance; you have to figure out how to keep your contributors happy and on the right path. The tone you set for your project early on will stick with it for a very long time, so it's important to be sure you're the one setting it rather than allowing it to happen outside your control.\n\nEvan will discuss managing a project as well as how contributors can make life easier for fellow developers.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GZSf/"
