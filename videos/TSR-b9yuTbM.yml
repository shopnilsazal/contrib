recordingDate: 1378506875
description: "Unexpected Stories From a Hacker Who Made it Inside the Government by Peiter Mudge Zatko\n\nHaving had the opportunity to see things from within the hacker community and from a senior position in the DoD, Mudge has some enlightening stories to share, and is picking some of his favorites. He'll discuss Julian's story to him about US government involvement in the origins of Wikileaks, how the DoD accidentally caused Anonymous to target government systems, some of the ways in which the defense industrial base's poor security works financially in its favor, and cases where the government missed opportunities for positive outreach and understanding with this community.\n\nYou'll probably recognize parts of these stories from the news, but there are origins and back stories that are lesser known, and that should make for a good story time."
