description: "Stefan Behnel - Get native with Cython\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\n[Cython][1] is not only an excellent and widely used tool to speed up computational Python code, it's also a very comfortable way to talk to native code and libraries. The Cython compiler translates Python code to C or C++ code, and supports static type annotations to allow direct use of C/C++ data types and functions. The tight integration of all three languages makes it possible to freely mix Python features like generators and comprehensions with C/C++ features like native data types, pointer arithmetic or manually tuned memory management in the same code.\n\nThis talk by a core developer introduces the Cython compiler by\ninteractive code examples and presents recent enhancements in the\nlanguage that continue to make Cython the best choice for the\ndevelopment of fast and portable Python extensions.\n\n**Update:** Examples used in presentation as **[IPython/Jupyter][3]**\nor **[HTML][2]**\n\n[1]: http://cython.org/\n[2]: http://consulting.behnel.de/ep/2015/ep15-cython.ipynb\n[3]: http://consulting.behnel.de/ep/2015/ep15-cython.html"
