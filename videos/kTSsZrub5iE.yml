recordingDate: 1431021466
description: "By, Michael Chan\nReact is the best way to bring interactive UIs to your Rails apps. But using React.js on Rails can be hard. NPM libraries are difficult to include, JSX seems nonsensical, and “can we still use CoffeeScript?”\n\nThere’s not one obvious path for working with React.js on Rails. In this talk, we’ll review the sordid past of Rails and JavaScript, explore the complementarity of React and Rails, and navigate the woes of integrating with NPM. We’ll discover why React is a natural fit for Rails today and how to make Rails love React in the future."
