title: 'EmberConf 2014 Array Computing Properties by David J. Hamilton'
recordingDate: 1399404911
description: "Computed properties are an important feature for any ember.js developer to master. This talk offers an overview of a particular subset of computed properties: array computed properties,\nwhich allow for partial recomputation. This is the feature that saves, for instance, `Ember.computed.filterBy` from having to completely recompute the filtered array when an item is added to its dependent array.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1l/"
