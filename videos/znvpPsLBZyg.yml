description: "RubyConf 2016 - Building HAL: Running Ruby with Your Voice by Jonan Scheffler\n\nWe’ve been living in the future for a full 15 years already and developers are still using antiquated technology like “keyboards” and “mice” to run their applications.\n\nWe’re going to learn to use voice recognition to run our Ruby code so we won’t need to depend on archaic plastic input methods to live our megalomaniacal dreams.\n\nI think we can all agree that the world needs more robots listening to our every word, let’s build an army of them and arm them with Ruby!"
