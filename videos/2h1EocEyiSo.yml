description: "Nobody Expects an Inquisition! - A Programmer’s Guide to Asking Questions by Amanda Quaranto\n\nWhat was the last question you asked someone? Did you actually care what the answer was? Did it improve the conversation? Did it start an interesting discussion? Did it start an argument?\n\nLike many programmers, I’ve relied on deductive reasoning to avoid asking questions - fearing that someone would find out I didn't belong. At the start of this year, I made the decision to change all that. This talk will evaluate tools which improved my professional and personal life.\n\nLet’s learn how to rely less on being intuitive and more on being inquisitive."
