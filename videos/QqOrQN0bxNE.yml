description: "The shell console hasn't changed in 40 years. Time for an update. Use Ruby to make commands that have menus, that you can navigate with the keyboard or your mouse. Type commands anywhere, not just at the bottom prompt. Control your rails apps, web browser, databases, and other tools. Type wiki elements like headings and bullet points. Xiki is implemented in ruby. Make new commands out of simple ruby classes.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGfH/"
