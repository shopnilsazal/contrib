title: '[DevFest Nantes 2017] Debugging Go programs with Delve'
language: French
recordingDate: 1509352385
description: "Speaker : Derek Parker (CoreOS)\n\nDebugging Go can be a difficult task, especially with traditional debuggers such as 'gdb' or 'lldb'. The language has a lot of powerful features which while incredibly useful, can make debugging tough problems tricky. In this talk I will begin by introducing Delve, a Go-specific debugger. Following the introduction I will discuss what makes Go different from other languages, how Delve is different from other debuggers, how it works, and how you can use it to debug your own Go programs.\n\nTo explain what makes Go different from other languages, I will take a deep dive into the Go runtime, and other aspects of Go that set it apart and, consequently, can make it difficult to debug. From there I will explain the internals of Delve and how it works under the hood. Finally, I'll talk through how to use Delve to help fix difficult bugs in your own Go code.\n\nThis talk will be very beneficial for beginner to expert Go programmers."
