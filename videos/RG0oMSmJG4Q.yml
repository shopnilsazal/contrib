recordingDate: 1504280778
description: "Fast, Safe, Pure-Rust Elliptic Curve Cryptography by Isis Lovecruft &  Henry De Valence\n\nThis talk discusses the design and implementation of curve25519-dalek, a pure-Rust implementation of operations on the elliptic curve known as Curve25519. We will discuss the goals of the library and give a brief overview of the implementation strategy. We will also discuss features of the Rust language that allow us to achieve competitive performance without sacrificing safety or readability, and future features that could allow us to achieve more safety and more performance. Finally, we will discuss how -dalek makes it easy to implement complex cryptographic primitives, such as zero-knowledge proofs."
