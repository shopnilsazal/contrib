description: "\"\"Emergent gameplay\"\" is still a buzzword in the field of game design, and it remains an enticing idea because it is the key to near infinite replayability. An important subset of the concept is \"\"emergent narrative,\"\" that is, the unwritten stories that appear out of the simulation itself. This 2014 talk from Paradox's Henrik Fahraeus explores the (often bloody) emergent stories of the open-ended strategy RPG Crusader Kings II, the quest for balance between narrative forms, and the vast untapped potential of this type of game.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
