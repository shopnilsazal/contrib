description: "Last year we proved that the whitelist-based approach of Content Security Policy (CSP) is flawed and proposed an alternative based on 'strict-dynamic' in combination with nonces or hashes.\n\nIn our academic paper (CSP Is Dead, Long Live CSP! On the Insecurity of Whitelists and the Future of Content Security Policy, ACM CCS, 2016), we demonstrated, using automatic checks, that 94.72% of all real-world policies can be trivially bypassed by an attacker with an XSS bug, and 75.81% are bypassable due to whitelists.\n\nThanks to the new 'strict-dynamic' approach, we were finally able to deploy an effective policy to many important Google products, such as GMail, Photos, and others. In this presentation we would like to share our experience, show examples, best practices and common pitfalls.\n\nFinally, we share how we are addressing the recent bypasses of nonce-based policies, such as nonce exfiltration/reuse techniques and dangling markup attacks.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
