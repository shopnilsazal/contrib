description: "Pushing CSP to PROD: Case Study of a Real-World Content-Security Policy Implementation - Brian Holyfield, Erik Larsson\n\nWidespread adoption of Content Security Policy (CSP) by most modern browsers has led many organizations to consider implementing CSP to thwart Cross-Site Scripting attacks in their web applications.  In this session we will walk you through our experience successfully implementing CSP on our customer-facing web application, SendSafely.com, which relies heavily on JavaScript and HTML5. \n\nOur story will arm you with the knowledge you'll want should you decide to go down the same path.  When we initially decided to implement CSP, the BETA version of our website was already live.  Like many sites, our platform grew from something we initially started as a pet project.  Admittedly, building CSP into our site from day one would have been much easier...but not nearly as challenging or fun.   \nWe'll start by walking you through our Content Security Policy, discuss the basic nuances between how each major browser implements CSP, and outline techniques for how we deal these nuances at runtime.   \n\nNext, we'll discuss the basic techniques we used for converting all of our classic \"in-line\" JavaScript to comply with the strict CSP that we developed.  We'll also talk about the not-so-easy task of getting third-party JavaScript to play nicely with CSP (cough, ReCaptcha, cough) and cover some edge cases we ran into related to the newer HTML5 APIs we rely on for certain tasks. \n\nLastly, we'll discuss what we learned from implementing a notification mechanism to report violations of our CSP at runtime.  Needless to say we were surprised by what was reported, and we'll share the results.   \nOur hope is that by telling our story to the world, we'll either save the rainforest or make your life a little easier should you decide to implement CSP (worst case scenario we'll save you the trouble and dissuade you from even trying).\n\n\nSpeakers\n\nBrian Holyfield\nGotham Digital Science\nBrian is a founding member of Gotham Digital Science.
