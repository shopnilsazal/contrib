description: "Groovy, There's a Docker in My Application Pipeline [B] - Kris Buytaert, Inuits\n\nIn the era of Infrastructure as Code we strive to automate everything,\nthis talk will discuss our experiences in automating the deployment of\nbuilding of continuous delivery pipelines and solving testing and application packaging problems. We'll take a populare Open Source dashboard application and show how we build and test the platform using\ncontainers, and we'll also discuss how we use the Jenkins DSL to\nautomate the generation of this pipeline so we can easily repeat this pattern for other applications.\n\n\nBuzzword bingo : Docker, Jenkins, Ruby, Jenkins DSL, Puppet, Groovy,\nDashing.\n\nAbout Kris Buytaert\nKris Buytaert is a long time Linux and Open Source Consultant. He's one of instigators of the devops movement, currently working for Inuits He is frequently speaking at, or organizing different international conferences and has written about the same subjects in different Books, Papers and Articles He spends most of his time working on bridging the gap between developers and operations with a strong focus on High Availability, Scalability , Virtualisation and Large Infrastructure Management projects hence trying to build infrastructures that can survive the 10th floor test, better known today as the cloud while actively promoting the devops idea !
