recordingDate: 1389582781
description: "by Sarah Blackthorne\n\nGetting our clients clear on the story behind their product is critical to creating the best possible product. Using principles of traditional storytelling, we can walk our clients through simple exercises to clarify, solidify, and streamline the product story. I've created exercises to share with you that are engaging, easy-to-use, and versatile enough for a wide-range of product development, but focus on reaching the core of your product story. Spending the 30-45 minutes on these exercises (or any combination thereof) will help your entire team understand the motivation behind your product, provide a structure to your design and development, and help ensure that your consumer hears the exact story your client is hoping to tell.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG4j/"
