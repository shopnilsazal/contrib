description: "What Roleplaying Games Can Teach Us About Open Source Communities by Al Nelson\n\nIn games, a valuable team is made up of characters with varied talents and skills. They need to be adaptable, to communicate, and most of all, to work together. As a team, they can accomplish even the most intimidating quests. It's time we took this mentality to the open source community.\n\nRoleplaying games can teach us a lot about diversity and working as a team if we dig a little deeper. In such games, players take on the role of a fantasy character and participate in quests and adventures with a group of other players. During this talk, I will take popular fantasy classes and relate them to the variety of people who contribute to open source communities every day.\n\nJust like a roleplaying party would fail with only type of character, open source needs the unsung heroes: the technical writers, the artists, the testersâ€”to make the project a reality. By building our 'party' around diverse interests and welcoming newcomers with open arms, open source communities can prosper.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HOG7/"
