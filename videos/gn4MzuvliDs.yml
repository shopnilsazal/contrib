description: "This multidisciplinary GDC 2016 talk from Square Enix Montreal's Antoine Routon is a postmortem of Lara Croft GO, discussing how the developer bridged the gap between two very different franchises, distilled the action-packed adventures of Lara into a puzzle format, and all the lessons that were learned along the way.\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
