description: "By, João Moura\n\nIf you are working on a serious project, you want it to scale. The thing about scale is, you only focus on it once you really need it. I’m the CTO of an soccer social network based in Brazil. To put it mildly, soccer is big in my country. This summer, we focused our marketing on the World Cup, preparing our application to support as many users as possible. To do that, we had to benchmark and improve, but how could we load test? What tool should we use? Those are just some questions that I'll go through in this talk, that will show youhot to address this challenge so stress test you app.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FrUZ/"
