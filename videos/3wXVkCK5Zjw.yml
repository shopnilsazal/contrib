description: "JP Dunning - Katana: Portable Multi-Boot Security Suite\nTired of keeping up with dozens of CDs and flash drives loaded with various Live operating systems and applications? I will be introducing the Katana: Portable Multi-Boot Security Suite; which brings many of the best live operating systems and portable applications together onto a single flash drive. Katana includes live distros like Backtrack, the Ultimate Boot CD, UBCD4Win, Ophcrack, and Trinity Rescue Kit as well as hundreds of portable applications like Wireshark, Angry IP, The Sleuth Kit, ClamAV, and OllyDBG. I will cover how Katana was made, what tools are included, how to add additional distributions and applications, and how to use Katana for every day needs.\n\nJP Dunning is currently a Graduate Student in Computer Science at Virginia Tech. Working as a researcher in the Virginia Tech IT Security lab. Research interests include the fields of wireless and portable security.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
