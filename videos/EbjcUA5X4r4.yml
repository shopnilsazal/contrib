recordingDate: 1383377255
description: "https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-19/dc-19-presentations/PCI-PANEL/DEFCON-19-JackDaniel-PCI-2-PANEL.pdf\n\nBuilding on last year's panel discussion of PCI and its impact on the world of infosec, we are back for more- including \"actionable\" information. Having framed the debates in the initial panel, this year we will focus on what works, what doesn't, and what we can do about it.\n\nCompliance issues in general, and PCI-DSS in particular, are driving security in many organizations. In tight financial times, limited security resources are often exhausted on the \"mandatory\" (compliance) at the expense of the \"optional\" (actual security). We will focus on the information needed to reconcile these issues, and encourage the audience to continue the discussion with us.\n\nJack Daniel is old, and has a Unix Beard, so people mistakenly assume he knows stuff. He still makes no attempt to correct this gross misunderstanding. Jack has proven himself to be an inciteful moderator on compliance topics. He has many years of network and systems administration experience, and a bunch of letters after his name. Jack lives and breathes network security as Product Manager for Tenable.\n\nJames Arlen , CISA, sometimes known as Myrcurial is a cyber-security cyber-consultant usually found in tall buildings wearing a cyber-suit, founder of the Think|Haus hackerspace, columnist at Liquidmatrix Security Digest, Infosec Geek, Hacker, Social Activist, Author, Speaker and Parent.

He writes for newschoolsecurity.com dub cloud.com, and Verizon's security blog.\n\nMartin McKeay is the host and author of the Network Security Blog and Podcast. He is a well known expert in the field of PCI and has worked as a QSA for over four years; he's seen the security compliance can encourage, as well as the lengths people will go to in order to avoid implementing real security. He is an advocate for PCI and compliance while recognizing it's limitation, a dichotomy that sometimes threatens his sanity.\n\nDave Shackleford is a SANS Analyst, instructor and GIAC technical director.
