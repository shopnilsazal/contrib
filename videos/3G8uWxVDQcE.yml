description: "Self-hosted, Scale, and Federation with Kubernetes v1.4 and Beyond - Brandon Philips, CoreOS, Inc.\n\n\"Cloud native architecture is becoming more flexible and accommodating of the increasingly diverse needs of operators. This talk will provide an overview of the latest developments on the open source projects CoreOS develops and contributes to in the Kubernetes ecosystem. This talk will cover the introduction of cluster federation, the status of easy to operate \"\"self-hosted\"\" clusters, and the latest progress on etcd v3, and why all of these developments are pushing the envelope of hyperscale infrastructure. And discuss the user demands that are driving these changes.\n\nWith the rise in demand to run internet services, businesses are all becoming software companies. For businesses to scale and meet these demands, automatic, painless software updates and improved infrastructure are essential. Cloud native infrastructure is designed to meet these demands, and CoreOS is making cloud native solutions available for everyone, with what we call GIFEE: Googleâ€™s infrastructure for everyone. This talk will cover the major investments in open source technology CoreOS is making to enable GIFEE.\"\n\nAbout Brandon\nBrandon Philips is helping to build modern Linux server infrastructure at CoreOS as CTO. Prior to CoreOS, he worked at Rackspace hacking on cloud monitoring and was a Linux kernel developer at SUSE. As a graduate of Oregon State's Open Source Lab he is passionate about open source technologies."
