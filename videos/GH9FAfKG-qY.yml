description: "By Forrest Chang\n\nA short time ago, in an internet not far away ...\n\nIt is a period of Javascript revolution. Rebel Ruby coders, striking \nfrom an obscure repository, have won significant victories against \nevil Javascript Empire.\n\nDuring the battle, Rebel Ruby coders have managed to duplicate the \nEmpire's ultimate weapon, the use of the same language on both server and\nclient sides, but this time with a language with enough meta programming \npower to make the most elegant DSLs on the planet.\n\nPursued by myriad Javascript options, the Rebel Coders race home to \ntheir repositories, custodian of the code that can save their people and \nrestore freedom to Ruby Coders everywhere. \n---\n\nDo you have mixed feelings about the Javascript Revolution? It is a \ntruly exciting time with many options and opportunities. \nUnfortunately, the language of this revolution is Javascript.\n\n\"Javascript is the path to the dark side. Javascript leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.\" \n- Yoda, if he were a coder\n\nWith all this Javascript goodness, what's a Ruby programmer to do? One \nword - Opal. Opal is a source to source ruby to javascript compiler, \ncorelib and a runtime implementation that currently passes 1716 \nrubyspecs w/a reachable goal of passing them all.\n\nYou might be thinking, yet another language that compiles down to \nJavascript. Why should you as a Ruby Coder board care?\n\nMatz once wrote: \n\"For me the purpose of life is partly to have joy. Programmers often feel joy when they can concentrate on the creative side of programming, So Ruby is designed to make programmers happy.\"\n\nAs another Ruby, Opal is designed to make programmer's happy\n\nHere's the top 8 reasons why Opal will make you, the Ruby programmer, happy \n1. It's just Ruby, and a viable one \n2. Greenspun's 10th Rule, Opal Edition \n3. Solves things the Ruby way, making the programmer happy \n4. Frameworks, we don't need no stinking frameworks (but we have some) \n5. Tools you already know and love \n6. Easy integration with Ruby web frameworks \n7. Awesome In Browser tools \n8. New possibilities\n\nThis talk will go over those 8 reasons and more. There will be live code demonstrations.\n\nOpal, this might just be the droid you're looking for.\n\nYou'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss Javascript goodbye. Coming a computer near you.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG40/"
