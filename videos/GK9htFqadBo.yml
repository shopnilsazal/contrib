description: "by Javier D. Garcia-Lasheras\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nIn this talk, we will provide a brief introduction to the State-of-the-Art ofHigh Level Synthesis for FPGA, utterly dominated by privative & vendorspecific solutions but quietly becoming mainstream as algorithm accelerationbecomes a must to reach the computational power we need to move systemintelligence right to the edge.\n\nAs an example of how this can be tackled from a FLOSS approach, we willprovide a practical example on how to use[HDLMake](http://www.ohwr.org/projects/hdl-make/) to merge the FPGA bitstreaminto the Operating System, handling everything as a single Embedded Linuxruntime and providing a convenient abstraction to build & manage productiongrade Cyber-Physical Systems.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 11:30:00"
