title: 'Application Security: Everything we know is wrong - Eoin Keary'

description: "Application Security: Everything we know is wrong - Eoin Keary\n\nThe premise behind this talk is to challenge both the technical controls we recommend to developers and also our actual approach to testing and developing secure software. \nThis talk is sure to challenge the status quo of web security today. \n\n\"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.\" - Albert Einstein \n\nWe continue to rely on a \"pentest\" to secure our applications. Why do we think it is acceptable to perform a time-limited test of an application to help ensure security when a determined attacker may spend 10-100 times longer attempting to find a suitable vulnerability? \n\nOur testing methodologies are non-consistent and rely on the individual and the tools they use; Some carpenters use glue and some use nails when building a wooden house. \n\nWhich is best and why do we accept poor inconsistent quality. \n\nFire and forget scanners won't solve security issues. Attackers take time and skill but our industry accepts the output of a software programme to help ensure security? \nHow can we expect developers to listen to security consultants when the consultant has never written a line of code? \n\nWhy don't we ask 'How much code development have you done, seen as you are assessing my code for security bugs?\" Currently we treat vulnerabilities like XSS and SQLI as different issues but the root causes it the same. -- it's all code injection theory!! Why do we do this and make security bugs over complex?\n\nWhy are we still happy with \"Testing security out\" rather than the more superior \"building security in\"?\n\n\nSpeaker\n\nEoin Keary\nCTO and Founder, BCC Risk Advisory Ltd.\n\nEoin Keary is the CTO and founder of BCC Risk Advisory Ltd. (bccriskadvisory.com) a local Irish company who specialise in secure application development, advisory, penetration testing, Mobile & Cloud security and training.\n\nHe is also an international board member, and secretary of OWASP, The Open Web Application Security Project (owasp.org). During his time in OWASP he has lead the OWASP Testing and Security Code Review Guides and also contributed to OWASP SAMM, ASVS.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
