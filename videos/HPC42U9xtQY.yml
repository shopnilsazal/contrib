description: "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nCausal Inference, AKA how effective is your new product, policy or feature? Inspired by A\\B testing in tech, organizations have turned to randomized testing. However, randomization often fails, leaving us in a biased reality. Join us on our quest to dispel myths about randomized testing and build practical models for effect measurement in business situations, in this Eneco-Heineken joint talk.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/python-and-the-holy-grail-of-causal-inference-dennis-ramondt-huib-keemink\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
