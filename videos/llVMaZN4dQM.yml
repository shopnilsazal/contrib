description: "Storytelling is a fundamental part of game design, but game documentation is notorious for being dry, distant and generally unreadable. In this 2014 talk, Harmonix's Matthew Derby lays out why documents should ignite the creative fire in teams, provoke conversation and help everyone on the project understand the vision of the game.\_\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
