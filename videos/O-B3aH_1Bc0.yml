description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #10\n29 November 2017\nSponsored and Hosted by Kenshoo\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nWeb Mail has grown significantly in the last decade, with 95% of its traffic being generated by automated scripts or “machines”. In this reality of an ever growing mailbox, you, the email user, rightfully expect your email provider to do a good job in organizing your electronic life.\n\nIn this talk we will discuss this challenge, and will present a classification algorithm for message clusters, developed by my team and myself at Yahoo research. The clusters of the messages are generated by a new clustering method, leveraging the HTML structure.\n\nThe classification algorithm was evaluated on a large scale experiment carried over real Yahoo mail traffic and achieved precision and recall rates between 85%-90%. It has been deployed in production in Yahoo mail backend and, as we speak, is sorting the messages in your Yahoo inbox.\n\nIrena Grabovitch-Zuyev is a Senior Research Engineer in Yahoo Research (Oath). She received her bachelor's degree and a master's degree from the Technion. She is a past Google Anita Borg scholar, who strongly believes that increasing women’s representation in the tech is essential. After having several papers accepted to top conferences and filling a few patents, she is confidant that her 3 most successful projects are her kids. \n\nIrena's graduate studies focused on Information Retrieval in Social Networks. In her work in Yahoo, she is mainly working on Automatic Extraction and Classification using machine learning algorithms.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
