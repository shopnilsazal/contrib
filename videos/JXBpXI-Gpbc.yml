description: "DEF CON 16 - Panel: Meet the FEDs\nEver had to sweat through an interrogation or watch some poor sap suffer a similar fate? Have you ever wanted to turn the tables and put those cruel individuals responsible on the chopping block? Well, now you can! With representatives from NSA, NASA, FBI, IRS, DHS, and other fine Federal agencies, you will have an abundance of opportunities to attempt to humiliate, harass, threaten, or even bring them to tears. Go ahead hack away and take your best shot! Remember, what is said on this panel in Vegas, stays on this panel in Vegas...\n\nAgain this year we will have many federal agencies -\n\nInformation Assurance Panel: CERTS, first responder's organizations from agencies including DC3, DHS USCERT, NSA, OSD, and NDU\n\nLaw Enforcement Counterintelligence Panel: including DC3, FBI, IRS, NCIS, NASA, NWC3, US Postal IG\n\nEach of the agency reps make an opening statement regarding their agencies role, then open it up to the audience for questions.\n\nAgencies that will have representatives include: Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3), FBI, IRS, NCIS, NASA, DHS USCERT, DoJ, National White Collar Crime Center (NWC3), NSA, US Postal IG, Office of the Secretary of Defense, National Defense University.\n\nFor years Defcon participants have played \"Spot the Fed.\" For the 3rd year, the feds will play \"Spot the Lamer\". Come out and nominate a Lamer and watch the feds burn'em."
