description: "\"Pythonist view on Microservices & Containerization\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - Arengo]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nMicroservices architecture and containerization are words thrown around when we talk about designing systems that are loosely coupled, although it may sound like buzz words but these key concepts play a very important part in system as a whole.\n\nIn this talk, we will cover how microservices can be implemented in python using available open source frameworks and how it can be deployed independently to scale and perform in production environment. I'll also share several use-cases where it is worth planning and developing system architecture considering microservices/containerization and will also discuss some trade-off of having such architecture.\n\nOutline:\n\n\nOverview of microservices\nImplementing microservices using Python\nAdvantages of microservices over Monolithic / SoA architecture\nOverview of containerization\nHow to containerize Python based services (Docker)\nAdvantages of microservices/containerization over traditional deployment\nCI/CD Approach in microservices and containerization\nUsecases where to use microservices\nTrade-off of using microservices\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
