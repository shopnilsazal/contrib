recordingDate: 1383314117
description: 'This is a pure live demo without slides. I fire up an Erlang VM instance, in which I''ll activate 1000 parallel actors. Then I''ll send out a chaos monkey to produce unpredictible and partially critical situations in the system. During the demo I''ll explain, how this situations are being managed and solved in the running system. Also, the basic mechanisms of the Erlang VM as well as relevant parts of the ecosystem will be explained.'
