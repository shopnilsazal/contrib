description: "AppSec California 2015 - Day 2, Track 2, Slot 2\n\nTitle\n\nWhy Your AppSec Experts Are Killing You\n\nAbstract\n\nSoftware development has been transformed by practices like Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, while application security has remained trapped in expert-based waterfall mode. In this talk, Jeff will show you how you can evolve into a “Continuous Application Security” organization that generates assurance automatically across an entire application security portfolio. Jeff will show you how to bootstrap the “sensor-model-dashboard” feedback loop that makes real time, continuous application security possible.\n\nHe will demonstrate the approach with a new *free* tool called Contrast for Eclipse that brings the power of instrumentation-based application security testing directly into the popular IDE. Check out “Application Security at DevOps Speed and Portfolio Scale” for some background.\n\nBio\n\nCTO of Contrast Security. Continuous Application Security. OWASP. DevOps\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
