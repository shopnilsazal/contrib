description: "Building Single Page Applications with the AngularJS Framework works like a charm.\nIt gives you Dependency Injection, Two-Way Data-Binding and it's built with testability in mind.\n\nAnother feature of AngularJS is localization. This, however, is restricted to datetime, number and currency operations on a filter level.\n\nPascal will show you how to go beyond the basic AngularJS localization support with the angular-translate module, by making use of the provided Two-Way Data-Binding mechanism.\n\nThis talk is especially for people who haven't done much with AngularJS yet.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG36/"
