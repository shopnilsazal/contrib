description: "\"IPv6, DNSSEC, RPKI, etc.: What's the Holdup and How Can We Help?\", by Richard Jimmerson, IETF ISOC\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this video are those of the speaker(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the USENIX Association.**\r\n\r\nYou're busy. We get it. This industry moves fast and you've got your hands full keeping your networks updated and secure from the threat of the day. But why is it taking so long to deploy IPv6, DNSSEC, and other standards coming out of the IETF? These standards are the future of the Internet, but deployment to date has been slow.\r\nThe Internet Society has launched a new initiative that aims to bridge the gap between the IETF standards process and final adoption of those standards by the global operations community. Already deployed the latest and greatest technologies? Work with us on case studies and how-to documents to help other organizations. Ready to deploy IPv6, but don't know where to start? Let us know what you need. We're amassing a collection of detailed, hands-on information that you can easily use to get your organization moving in the right direction. In this talk, I'll explain the new initiative and provide a forum for you to share your needs and your success stories."
