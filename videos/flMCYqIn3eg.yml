language: English
recordingDate: 1520463573
description: 'Sequence classification tasks can be solved in a number of ways, including both traditional ML and deep learning methods. Catch Lauren Tranâ€™s talk at the Women in Machine Learning and Data Science meetup as she discusses the general LSTM, CNN, and SVM algorithms, how they work, and how they are applied in sequence labeling tasks with time series data. She''ll walk through a practical application of applying these algorithms and techniques to financial transaction data to detect signs of financial distress and predict insolvency.'
