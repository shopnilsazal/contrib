description: "RailsConf 2018: Ales on Rails: Making a Smarter Brewery with Ruby by Ben Shippee\n\nRails is a great framework to empower people to work smarter, not harder. I'll be sharing the evolution of technology in a Pittsburgh brewery, from a simple MVP to a production application. This talk will explore how Ruby and Rails was leveraged to help manage brewery data, control aspects of the taproom environment, and automate the tedious parts of the job to a few clicks."
