title: 'RailsConf 2014 - What the Cache?! by Simon Kr√∂ger'
recordingDate: 1399991891
description: "\".. and then cache the hell out of it!\" This is usually how the talk ends when it comes to rails performance tips, but in reality it is where the fun starts. This talk goes way beyond Rails.cache, it explores layered caches, discusses the CPU cost of marshaling, the latency even Memcache adds and how to dodge the unavoidable stampedes that invalidating your caches will cause. This is the tale of how to survive half a billion requests per day with Rails and MySQL (hint: don't query it).\n\nSimon took his experience from 12 years of freelancing for various companies around the globe and working with a very diverse set of technologies to build his dream team at SponsorPay and work with the language he loves - Ruby.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG19/"
