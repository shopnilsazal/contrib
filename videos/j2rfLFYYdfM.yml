Our users swipe for a variety of purposes, like dating to find love, expanding social networks and meeting locals when traveling.\nRecommendation is an important service behind-the-scenes at Tinder, and a good recommendation system needs to be personalized to meet an individual user’s preferences. In this talk, we will discuss a new personalized recommendation approach being developed at Tinder, called TinVec. TinVec embeds users’ preferences into vectors leveraging on the large amount of swipes by Tinder users. We will discuss the design, implementation, and evaluation of TinVec as well as its application to\npersonalized recommendations.\n\nSee Dr. Steve's slides here: https://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/dr-steve-liu-chief-scientist-tinder-at-mlconf-sf-2017"
