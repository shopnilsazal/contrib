title: 'GoGaRuCo 2010 - Polyglot: When Ruby isn''t enough or even sane by: Blake Mizerany'
recordingDate: 1428437966
description: "You're so polyglot and you don't even know it. You may be using Ruby for too much. It's not the holy grail. This talk will pull from my experience at Heroku where I use much more than Ruby everyday; and I'm not just talking JavaScript. Technologies are designed to take on problems of a specific nature. There are those that are great for systems work and those that are not. Some make generating reports a cinch. A few are remarkable at digging through data. Networking can be a nightmare in some. I'll start with a swift but gentle introduction to Ruby's good but not great suits and move us into what to replace them with.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GZSn/"
