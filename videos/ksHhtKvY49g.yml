description: "You are performing a pentest. You just owned the first domain controller. That was easy. All the computers are belong to you. But unfortunately, you can't reach the final goal. The last target is further in the network, non accessible and heavily filtered. Thankfully, one last hope remains. You realize the target domain pulls its updates from the WSUS server of the compromised domain, the one you fully control. Hope is back... But once again, it fails. The only tools available for controlling the updates are not working: they require a network attack that is prevented by the network architecture and the server configuration. All hope is lost...\n\nWe will present you a new approach, allowing you to circumvent these limitations and to exploit this situation in order to deliver updates. Thus, you will be able to control the targeted network from the very WSUS server you own. By extension, this approach may serve as a basis for an air gap attack for disconnected networks.\n\nOur talk will describe vulnerable architectures to this approach and also make some in-context demonstration of the attack with new public tooling. Finally, as nothing is inescapable, we will also explain how you can protect your update architecture."
