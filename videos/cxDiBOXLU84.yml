description: "This talk introduces and illustrates the benefits of mutation testing to assess the quality of test suites. The intuition of this technique is simple: to determine if a test suite can detect bugs in a program, simply inject bugs in this program and check if the tests can detect them.\n\nIn this talk, I cover the following points :\n\n* the key principles of mutation analysis.\n* the Pit tool to perform mutation analysis on Java program to assess the quality of JUnit test suites.\n* the Descartes tool, an extension of Pit to scale mutation analysis to large Java projects\n* concrete examples of weaknesses in the test suite that are revealed by mutation analysis\n* the integration of Descartes in the new check API provided by Github\n\nSpeaker: Benoit Baudry\n\nMore details http://www.breizhjug.org/#/events?q=Mutation%20Testing%20for%20Java"
