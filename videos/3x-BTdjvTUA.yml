description: "Rain & urbanmonkey - Build a Lie Detector/Beat a Lie Detector\nEveryone seems to be acquainted with the idea that the polygraph is fallible and that there a million tricks that can supposedly be used to beat it, but how can you really know for sure? One way would be if you pieced together your own polygraph for the singular reason of trying to beat it and we have done just that. We will take a look at the history of deception detection from the birth of Jesus through the Age of Reason to try and get a grasp on how the modern day polygraph came about. Next comes the show and tell on exactly how the group built its own homebrew polygraph and the hilarity that ensues as we tried it out on our friends and family to answer the question; will they beat the machine, or will the machine beat them?\n\nRain was raised by a coven of nocturnal city attorneys in the then-unspoiled wilderness of Northern Ontario, and has since drawn upon the survival skills learned during these early times to thrive in today's burgeoning culture of new technology. After spending her formative years living under the sea, she then made inroads to Cusco, before subsequently traveling to Lemuria, Skull Island, and briefly and most recently a base camp in Mare Vaporum on the Moon. She currently splits her time between summers in Moaning Moose, Montana and winters in a research laboratory of indeterminate location.\n\nj03b34r is a system analyst in Calgary Alberta.
