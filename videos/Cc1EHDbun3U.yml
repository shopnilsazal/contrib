description: "Before LittleBigPlanet and Trials Evolution allowed users a way to create and share levels online, players could trade personalized content via floppy disk. In 1983, Electronic Arts published Pinball Construction Set with an abstract cover to match an equally experimental game that was one of the first to engender user generated content. In this GDC 2013 class postmortem, Bill Budge, the father of the seminal Pinball entry, will lay out the blueprints for how he constructed his own game and one of the earliest examples of an in-game editor.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
