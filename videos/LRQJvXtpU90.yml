description: 'Python is a great language for prototyping computer vision algorithms, the availability of libraries such as Numpy and Scipy make for rapid development similar to that of Matlab, R and IDL. At the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) we are solving the interesting problem of weather field warping. Warping (aka non-linear image registration) is used, for example, to determine what the predicted temperature will be hourly if we only have predictions every three hours'
