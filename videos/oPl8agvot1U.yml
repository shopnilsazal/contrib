recordingDate: 1337673799
description: 'Greg will be speaking about the map from trauma to survival that One Hundred For Haiti is exploring as it starts a new program called "Moto Logistics" as a development initiative in Haiti. The program might serve as a model to anyone doing development, social, or relief work anywhere in the world as a means of creating jobs and new opportunities from the standpoint of SELF empowerment rather than imposed empowerment.'
