description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2016 in Washington, DC\nhttps://2016.appsecusa.org/\n\nSPArring with the Security of Single Page Applications\n\nWhen SPArring with the security of a Single Page Application (SPA) you need to be like a Mixed Martial Artist (MMA) fighter who understands several specialties to be successful.\n\nIn MMA, a fighter needs to be skilled in several martial arts styles, such as boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai for the stand up portion of the fight. Then, he needs to know wrestling or judo to take the fight to the ground, and once he’s on the ground, he needs to know Jujitsu and Sambo to submit his opponent. \n\nWhen doing battle with a SPA, a pen-tester must become an MMA hacker…A Mixed Multilayer Application Hacker. As an MMA Hacker, you need to understand the multitude of complex application layers that are only getting more complex and interconnected by the day.\n\nThis discussion will include MMA Hacker training on the following application layers:\nInterface layer: Become familiar with SPA frameworks (AngularJS, ReactJS). These SPA frameworks fundamentally change the browser communication that security experts have long understood. \nBackend layer: Dig into different REST API’s and learn how they are used and where to find the weaknesses.\nNetwork layer: Learn more about WebSockets and how they fundamentally change TCP/HTTP as you have always known it to be.\nInterconnectivity layer: Get to know how SPA’s are often interconnected with 3rd party API’s or presentation elements and how this can create security issues that get inherited from trusting the 3rd party.\nTools: Understand what tools are available to help you address these challenges, and the potential gaps exist in the tools we all depend on.\n\nJoin this talk to start your MMA Hacker training today!\n\nDan Kuykendall\nSenior Director, Application Security Products , Rapid7\nDan Kuykendall is the Senior Director of Application Security Products at Rapid7 where he directs the strategic vision, research and product development for the company’s application security solutions. In addition to keeping up with the latest attack patterns, Dan remains focused on one of the toughest aspects of application security - the rapidly evolving web and mobile application development trends.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
