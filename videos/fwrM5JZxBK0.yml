recordingDate: 1475536490
description: "The history of hacking both new and old will be presented in music in this serious all-singing musical revue. Your favorite new hacks, long forgotten hacks, 0days, and computer security lessons will be told in song. It’s all happened before, and it will all happen again. These cautionary tales of hacking, crypto, computer security, reverse engineering, and pen testing will reawaken your passion for getting things right both at work and at home. Think you know all about your servers? Do you really practice what you technically preach? Are your policies being implemented? Come remember what got you fired up about computer security and share these pertinent cautionary songs with your friends and colleagues. This keynote will be sung and performed live with a piano.\n\n===\n\nFabienne Serriere is a French-American hardware hacker. She is currently working full time on her Kickstarter-funded company, KnitYak in Seattle, to bring scriptable custom one-off knitwear to everyone. After five years of open sourcing hardware and software and textile techniques for out of print 80’s consumer knitting machines, she upgraded to a modern 3000 pound industrial knitting machine. She loves all things *nix, open hardware, vintage hardware, ham radio (K7FP), sdr, mathematics, storage clusters, language learning (spoken and computer), and hopes someday to fly to spaaaaaaace."
