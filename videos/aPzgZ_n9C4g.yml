title: 'Jason Vertrees - Introducing the World of Commercial Real Estate Data to App Developers'
recordingDate: 1430493778
description: "PyData Dallas 2015\nMuch of the $15.2T commercial real estate (CRE) world is closed and clandestine. This has held the industry back from adopting technological progress, creating inefficiencies across the entire ecosystem. With the power of the internet at its side, RealMassive is beginning to break open this industry. One area in which we now shed light is commercial real estate availability data, or CRE supply side data. Application developers can now use our freely open RESTful API to augment their applications or services with CRE data and analytics. In this talk, we explore the API and provide a few examples of the power of being able to access and analyze CRE data."
