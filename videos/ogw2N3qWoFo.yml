recordingDate: 1530144007
description: "Atlassian’s strives to be a data driven company that builds collaborative software for teams. Two and a half years ago we launched our analytics platform (i.e. data lake) on AWS which is used by over 1500 internal users each month to gain insights and enforce decisions.\n\nIn this talk we will present a retrospective on our analytics platform covering our blessings (what went well) and our mistakes (what could have been better) as well as talking about what potential next steps we might take to further improve the platform.\n\nThis talk will cover both the technical aspect (i.e. architectural choices) as well as non-technical aspect (i.e. team organisation, our principals and mandate).\n\nRohan Dhupelia is the analytics platform manager of Atlassian. In this role he leads a team of awesome data and software engineers in an effort to further democratise data at Atlassian. The primary focus of Rohan’s career for the last 10+ years have been in the data space having done everything from BI report development to data warehousing and data engineering.\nFor more on YOW!
