description: "Everyone draws inspiration and motivation from different sources. For most, it's often frustration. We make life decisions, define new features, or refactor code when we get too annoyed by current circumstances. This is where [the speaker] admits they has a low tolerance for frustration. Having been frustrated a great deal during his career, [the speaker] will discuss several anti-patterns that they have seen in code and how to use the Dark Side of the Force (frustration, anger, and rage) to escape from them.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGcO/"
