description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nImproving your Kubernetes Workload Security with Hardware Virtualization - Fabian Deutsch, Red Hat & Samuel Ortiz, Intel (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nOn any given node, all Kubernetes workloads are running through software-only isolation. The security concerns related to that level of isolation could be mitigated by using hardware virtualization for both pods and traditional (legacy?) workloads. This talk will present two complementary approaches for doing so: Kata Containers and KubeVirt. We'll be describing how both projects leverage CPU virtualization to implement a stronger security architecture for Kubernetes. When combining both approaches, one can run a wider range of workloads, from untrusted containers through Kata Containers to more traditional, lift and shift applications with KubeVirt.\n\nAbout Samuel\nHe is a Principal Engineer at Intel.\n\nAbout Fabian\nFabian Deutsch is working at Red Hat and used to be much more active in the Fedora community as he is today, worked on the oVirt project for a few years, and is now involved in KubeVirt."
