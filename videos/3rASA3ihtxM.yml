description: "This talk will discuss the back-end implementation of the transaction and payment processing system for the Wingman mobile application. It will show how the requirements of high-demand mobile app interactions can be addressed via the creation of a RESTful API on top of a scalable server-based platform coded entirely in Erlang. It will conclude with a live demonstration where the operational backend will be published to Heroku's hosted service.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGdn/"
