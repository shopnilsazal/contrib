description: "This introductory talk is designed to help students new to functional programming understand how type parameters enable us to more easily reason about the behavior of functions and create APIs that enforce their invariants with type-level constraints. We will cover the principles of universal and existential quantification, review examples of reasoning about behavior from function types, and discuss implications for compositionality in API design. While most examples will be in Haskell, we will discuss how the principles generalize even to code written in unityped languages.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HdDA/"
