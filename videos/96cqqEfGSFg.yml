description: "Inspired by the medieval guild-and-apprentice system, the increasing popularity of bootcamps and apprenticeship programs in software development has great promise but may also bring with it some serious negative side effects. Let's explore the benefits of applying 12th century best practices to the challenge of preparing a new generation of developers, and discuss ways to avoid the mistakes of the past: technologically conservative monocultures comprising and serving a privileged few.\n\nCoraline Ada Ehmke is a speaker, author, teacher, open source advocate and technologist with 20 years of experience in developing apps for the web. As a co-founder of LGBTech.org and founder of OpenSourceForWomen.org, she works diligently to promote diversity and inclusivity in the tech industry. Her current interests include small-application ecosystems, services and APIs, business intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG1R/"
