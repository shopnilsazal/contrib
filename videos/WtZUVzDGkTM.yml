description: "RailsConf 2018: Some Funny Things Happened on The Way to A Service Ecosystem by Chris Hoffman\n\nSo this one time we ran Rails services over AMQP (instead of HTTP). You may be thinking “Why? Was that their first mistake?” It was not. From handling shared models poorly to deploying & operating services with inadequate tooling, we've made...so many mistakes. I'm glad we did; they helped us grow. We have patterns & practices for everything we’ve seen so far, from API contracts to distributed consensus protocols. Over this talk’s 40 minutes, you'll learn things it took us 3 years to grasp. Whether you have a monolith or pine for when you did, you'll be more prepared and better armed than we were."
