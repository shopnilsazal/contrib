description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nFrom Kubelet to Istio: Kubernetes Network Security Demystified - Andrew Martin, ControlPlane (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nKubernetes provides multiple layers of network security including the control plane, etcd, the CNI network, network policies, and - with Istio on top - the requests between applications themselves. In this talk we explore the underlying technologies on which these layers are built using approachable examples and demonstrations. Attendees can expect to gain an understanding of these implementations and the principles behind encryption, identity, and trust in Kubernetes.- What are TLS, X.509, and mutual authentication? - Why cloud native communication should be encrypted by default - Kubernetes component intercommunication - CNI and network policy for applications - Bootstrapping identity with SPIFFE - Mutual TLS, route rules, and destination policies in Istio\n\n\"About Andrew \nAndrew has a strong test-first engineering background gained developing and deploying high volume web applications. Proficient in application development and systems architecture and maintenance, he is comfortable profiling and securing every tier of a bare metal or virtualised web stack, and has battle-hardened experience delivering containerised solutions to enterprise clients. He is a co-founder at https://control-plane.io\""
