description: "Intro to Mocking: Why Unit Testing Doesn't Have To Be So Hard by Daniel Davis\n\nMany developers want to write better code, but simply don't know how to write units tests for:\n\nCode that calls other code (i.e. code with dependencies)\nMethods that have no return value\nCode that throws exceptions\nMocking provides a valuable tool for solving these problems. In this talk, we'll discuss the scenarios in which Mocking is useful, the strategies for addressing each of the cases above and write simple, clean unit tests using the built-in Mock library.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HH6d/"
