description: "By breaking narrative down to its smallest yet non-abstract elements and finding ways to combine and recombine them, one could potentially build a nearly infinite array of narrative opportunities out of these small building blocks. In this GDC 2014 talk, BioShock co-creator Ken Levine explains how it's time to start exploring 'narrative Legos'.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
