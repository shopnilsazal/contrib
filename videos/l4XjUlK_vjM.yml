title: 'Developing in NoSQL with Couchbase and java'
recordingDate: 1377017927
description: "NoSQL has garnered tremendous attention in recent years as the basis of architectures for building large linearly scalable systems. As a document oriented database, Couchbase Server presents the user with a simple approach to storing and retrieving data across a cluster and handles replication, rebalancing and so on.Couchbase Server 2.0, based on the Apache open source license, which builds upon Apache CouchDB and Memcached, has rich querying capabilities of the distributed database through views built atop an always updating incremental map-reduce. We will see how to access the simple and yet powerful constructs using a variety of code samples. These samples will demonstrate how to use the client SDKs for Java, .NET, PHP, Ruby and many other languages. We will also look at some ETL examples for transferring data between Couchbase and Hadoop.Attend this session for a very quick overview of Couchbase NoSQL, the ecosystem and what it means to developers, architects and implementers. We will demonstrate with examples of how to use the different language APIs with liberal but simple code examples on Couchbase to drive home some of these concepts. We will also cover some real-life case studies from big social gaming applications.\n\nJ'ai créé cette vidéo à l'aide de l'application de montage de vidéos YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/editor)."
