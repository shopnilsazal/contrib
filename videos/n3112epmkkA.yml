title: 'GoGaRuCo 2010 - Extending Rails 3 by: Yehuda Katz'
recordingDate: 1428437651
description: "Rails 3 has added quite a number of new ways to extend the framework. These include swapping in a new ORM that still works cleanly with ActionPack, a brand new instrumentation system, and ways to build custom controllers, mixing and matching the pieces that you want. In this talk, Yehuda will give an overview of these new systems, and show some real-world examples of using them in plugins and in your application itself. He will also talk about how to think about using the new Rails architecture to streamline your stack for performance-critical parts of your app, without losing the integration you've come to expect or the features you absolutely need in those cases.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GZSj/"
