title: 'Building and Running an Enterprise-grade Serverless Platform on Kubernetes - Ying Huang'
recordingDate: 1513370315
description: "Building and Running an Enterprise-grade Serverless Platform on Kubernetes - Ying Huang & Quinton Hoole, Huawei\n\nServerless platforms provide functions as a service, and have become a hot topic largely because they allow developers to focus on core business logic, leaving packaging, deployment, monitoring, event propagation, scaling and load balancing to the infrastructure. The serverless billing model is simple - pay-per-invocation - which can being significant benefits for many event-driven applications.\n\nHuawei launched its FunctionStage serverless platform, which is built on Kubernetes, in 2017. In this talk we will explain in detail the design and implementation of FunctionStage. This involved both fairly straightforward function packaging, scheduling, auto-scaling, event triggering and load balancing, as well as some significantly more interesting challenges related to container re-use, on-the-fly micro service provisioning, reliable operation and much more. We will demonstrate the use of our system to solve some complex real-world problems in Huawei Public Cloud.\n\nAbout Quinton Hoole\nQuinton is currently Technical Vice President of Cloud Computing at Huawei. Previously he spent five years at Google, where he was an Engineering Lead on the Kubernetes team, and Technical Lead and Manager of Ads Serving SRE. He was also the founding engineer of the Amazon EC2 cloud computing project (2005-2009) where he lead much of the early design, implementation and operation. As a lead engineer at Nimbula (a startup that was sold to Oracle in 2012), lead the design and development of their Cloud IAAS product (both private and public cloud). His experience prior to EC2 includes telecommunications (call center switches, CTI systems, mobile billing systems), financial (data exchanges, point-of-sale systems), travel (internet booking systems, airline and hotel reservation systems) and mobile (aviation GPS navigation, banking etc).\n\nAbout Ying Huang\nYing is currently a senior software architect at PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) team at Huawei. She played a key role leading the design and implementation of FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) platform in Huawei. Before that, she worked in Microsoft Azure Identity team as an engineer for two years. She also worked in Amazon as a platform software engineer for seven years."
