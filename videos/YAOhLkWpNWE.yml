description: "Ian Clarke, Freenet: Taming the World's Largest Tamagotchi\nSince March 2000 the Freenet project has been the very embodiment of the \"release early, release often\" mantra, gaining invaluable experience of the unpredictable challenges encountered when deploying a P2P architecture on a large scale. \nThis talk will discuss recent developments in the project including our \"next generation\" routing algorithm, and a sophisticated but elegant new load balancing mechanism called \"adaptive rate limiting\". Expect the talk to employ lots of real-world data to illustrate how theory translates to practice when looking after the world's largest Tamagotchi.\n\nIan Clarke is the architect and coordinator of The Freenet Project, and the Chief Executive Officer of Cematics Ltd, a company he founded to realize commercial applications for the Freenet technology. Ian is the co-founder and formerly the Chief Technology Officer of Uprizer Inc., which was successful in raising $4 million in A-round venture capital from investors including Intel Capital. In October 2003, Ian was selected as one of the top 100 innovators under the age of 35 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Technology Review magazine. Ian holds a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science from Edinburgh University, Scotland. He has also worked as a consultant for a number of companies including 3Com, and Logica UK's Space Division. He is originally from County Meath, Ireland."
