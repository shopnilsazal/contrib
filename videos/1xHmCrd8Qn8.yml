description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nContinuously Deliver your Kubernetes Infrastructure - Mikkel Larsen, Zalando SE (Advanced Skill Level)\n\nKubernetes provides the means for making it simple to continuously deliver our apps on top of clusters. But what about the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure? How can we continuously deliver improvements to the infrastructure and be confident that new changes will not have a negative impact on apps running on top? Using the rollout of Kubernetes at Zalando as an example Mikkel will discuss how Zalando manage 60+ production and test clusters, how they went from Kubernetes v1.4 and continuously updated all clusters to the latest stable release, and how they test every change to the cluster configuration. The talk will also take a small dive into the topic of testing clusters and give examples of how you, with little effort, can use and build upon the extensive conformance tests suite from Kubernetes to automatically end to end test changes to your own custom Kubernetes configuration.\n\nAbout Mikkel\nMikkel is a Software Engineer working at Europe's leading online Fashion platform, Zalando since 2016. He works in the Platform Infrastructure team focusing on Kubernetes and AWS infrastructure and has a big interest in Continuous Delivery and automation."
