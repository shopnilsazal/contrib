title: 'Reaktor Breakpoint 2018: Pip Mothersill, Designing the future designer’s toolbox'
recordingDate: 1528979784
description: "One of the founding ideas of pioneering media theorist Marshall McLuhan was that “we shape our tools and then our tools shape us”. In today’s digitally-mediated world, the shape of design and the role of designers in the creative process is very different to what it was even just ten years ago. As our design tools are beginning to understand more of our intuitive human knowledge, they have the ability to either automate our decisions away from us or become more intelligent collaborators in an enhanced creative process. How might our role as designers change in this computationally-mediated future and what tools will we need in our toolbox?\n\nJourneying through the history of computational design and the opportunities and challenges of our artificially intelligent future, this talk will consider the various approaches we have for digitally-enabled creativity today and how we can better design the interactions with our tools to shape the creative future we desire.\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018.
