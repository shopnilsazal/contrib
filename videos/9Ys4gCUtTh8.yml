description: "\"Practical Debugging - Tips, Tricks and Ways to think\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-14 - Arengo]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nWhen we write code, oftentimes things are not working as expected. We followed the tutorial and yet we got an error. We introduce a new feature but something else broke.\n\nHaving to deal with bugs is inevitable. Trying to \"\"debug\"\" what happened or what caused the problem can be really frustrating and timewasting.\n\nThe aim of this talk is go give ways to think &amp; steps to take when we are faced with the process of debugging.\n\nThe language for the examples is going to be Python &amp; the tools used - from the python ecosystem.\n\nThe talk will be practical, with a lot of real-world examples.\n\nThe goal is to cover the following scenarios by showing different ways to approch the problem:\n\nYou followed a tutorial but it's not working. What to do?\nYou introduce new feature but things broke somewhere else in the project. What to do?\nYou are using a popular 3rd party library but something breaks. What to do?\nA bug occurs and you have no idea what or who caused it. What to do?\nYou can't fix or find the bug. What now?\nYou want to generalize your debugging skills. How to do that?\n\nWe will be talking about critical changes, binary search, problem isolation, interactive debuggers, printing, testing, greping and other interesting things.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
