recordingDate: 1477350269
description: "PyData DC 2016\n\nInnovation today appears to be instantaneous in large part due to open source technology. Open Data Science is no exception. Python, a pillar in the Open Data Science bedrock, is well positioned to harvest innovation in software and with Anaconda, it’s also well positioned to capitalize on the latest hardware innovations. Anaconda and Intel are blazing a path for the Python community to take advantage of cognitive computing, including machine learning and deep learning.\n\nIn this keynote, Peter and Robert will talk about how Open Data Science––a connected ecosystem of data, analytics and compute––streamlines the path to high performance and innovation to achieve breakthrough results."
