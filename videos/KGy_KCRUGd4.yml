description: "by Jonathan Marcil, Application Security Engineer at Twitch\n\nAbstract: \nThreat Modeling is a great way to analyze security early in software development by structuring possible attacks, bad actors and countermeasures over a broad view of the targeted system. This talk will describe basic components of a threat model and how to use them effectively. Modeling concepts will be demonstrated using a cryptocurrency ecosystem as example.\n\nby Jonathan Marcil, Application Security Engineer of Twitch\n\nWebsite - https://twitter.com/jonathanmarcil\n\nJonathan Marcil is the former chapter leader of OWASP Montreal and is now based in beautiful Irvine, California.
