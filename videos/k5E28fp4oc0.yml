description: "Hacking Driverless Vehicles by Zoz Cannytrophic Design\n\nAre driverless vehicles ripe for the hacking? Autonomous and unmanned systems are already patrolling our skies and oceans and being tested on our streets and highways. All trends indicate these systems are at an inflection point that will show them rapidly becoming commonplace. It is therefore a salient time for a discussion of the capabilities and potential vulnerabilities of these systems.\n\nThis session will be an informative and light-hearted look at the current state of civil driverless vehicles and what hackers or miscreants might do to mess with them. Topics covered will include common sensors, decision profiles and their potential failure modes that could be exploited. With this talk Zoz aims to both inspire unmanned vehicle fans to think about robustness to adversarial and malicious scenarios, and to give the paranoid false hope of resisting the robot revolution. He will also present details of how students can get involved in the ultimate sports events for robot hacking, the autonomous vehicle competitions.\n\nZoz is a robotics interface designer and rapid prototyping specialist. He is a co-founder of Cannytrophic Design in Boston and CTO of BlueSky in San Francisco. As co-host of the Discovery Channel show 'Prototype This!' he pioneered urban pizza delivery with robotic vehicles, including the first autonomous crossing of an active highway bridge in the USA, and airborne delivery of life preservers at sea from an autonomous aircraft. He also hosts the annual AUVSI Foundation student autonomous robot competitions such as Roboboat and Robosub.\n\nMaterials: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Zoz/DEFCON-21-Zoz-Hacking-Driverless-Vehicles.pdf"
