description: "How to Load 1m Lines of Ruby in 5s by Andrew Metcalf\n\nApplications written in Ruby, Python and several other popular dynamic languages become very slow to boot as they grow to millions of lines of code. Waiting to reload code in development becomes a major frustration and drain on productivity.
