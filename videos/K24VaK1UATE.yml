title: 'AlterConf San Francisco 2015 - Overcoming Mental Heath Hurdles at Work'
recordingDate: 1432928723
description: "by Madalyn Rose Parker\n\nStatistically, 1 in 5 of us suffers from mental illness. Unfortunately, the stigma that follows sickness of the mind keeps discussions surrounding mental wellness to a minimum in the workplace. Iâ€™d like to tell you about my experience as a female engineer who openly shared details of my personal struggle with depression and anxiety with a founder of the company I work for. This spurred a company-wide presentation on ways that emotional and mental hurdles can affect work, different treatment options, and best practices for supporting coworkers. I want to talk about what Olark did to make me feel comfortable taking the leap of faith, what you can look for (and push for) at your workplace, and offer an example of success for those who struggle with mental obstacles."
