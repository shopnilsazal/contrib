description: "RailsConf 2017: Exploring the History of a 12-year-old Rails Application by Nathan Walls\n\nCome on a journey backward through time from the present all the way to August 2005 to see how a living and evolving Rails application started, changed, and continues.\n\nFind out some of the challenges and temptations in maintaining this application. See how different influences have coursed through the application as the team changed, the business grew and as Rails and Ruby evolved.\n\nWe'll explore history through code and learn from some of the developers involved in the application over its lifecycle to build an understanding of where the application is now and how it became what it is."
