description: "by Brandon Philips\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nKubernetes enables teams to focus on developing innovative applications bysimplifying deployment, scaling, and configuration through a simple yetflexible API. The system can support all types of applications: web apps,databases, distributed systems, or even VMs; and can do it on any cloud orbare-metal platform. Our vision is that every organization has access to thisinfrastructure technology, a mission we call #GIFEE: Google Infrastructure ForEveryone.\n\nBut, as Kubernetesâ€™s reach grows, what do real production applications looklike? Where does Kubernetes need to go to continue supporting an ever-widerrange?\n\nJoin Brandon Philips for a look at the status of Kubernetes and at the roadmapfor its future, including automated Kubernetes upgrades, management of complexapplications, integration with cloud providers, and multi-cluster federation.\n\n\nRoom: Janson\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 09:00:00"
