description: "One of the most important lessons I've learned is that programming languages are tools and not all tools are good for all jobs. Some tasks are easier to solve functionally. Some are clearly suited for OO. Others get simpler when you use constraint solving or pattern matching.\n\nLet's go on a whirlwind tour of 4 different programming languages emphasizing different programming techniques: OO, functional, logical, and procedural. You'll leave this talk with a better understanding of which languages are best suited to which types of jobs and a list of resources for learning more.\n\nEVENT:\n\nRubyConf 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAja Hammerly\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TBq__oKUzk"
