Project Tango was the first big step in bringing AR experience to many platforms. But it requires special hardware. ARCore is a fast, performant, Android-scale SDK that enables high-quality augmented reality across millions of qualified mobile devices. During the talk we discuss AR main principles, 3D modeling, object rendering and I will provide some practical tips on how to build AR focused apps.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
