description: "\"Ruby can't scale.\"\n\nTell that to LivingSocial, GroupOn, Gowalla, Sony, and the rest of our community pushing millions of requests per day. Scaling an application isn't about piling up hardware and dropping in the newest database fad, it's the combination of design and refinement.\n\nIn this session, we'll look at refining Ruby code using tools to:\n\nFind CPU-intensive hotspots Measure memory and object allocation Monitor query count and duration Isolate data-store bottlenecks This is not about info-porn. It's about finding the 1% of your code that, through optimization, can dramatically improve performance.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGkf/"
