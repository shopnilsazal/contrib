recordingDate: 1392967961
description: "Richard Thieme- Hacking: The Next Ten Years\nTen years ago hacking was a frontier; ten years from now, hacking will be embedded in everything we do, defined by the context in which it emerges. Real hackers will be pushing the frontiers of information networks, perception management, the wetware/dryware interface, and the exploration of our galactic neighborhood. Mastery means not only having the tools in your hands but knowing that you have them ... and using them to build the Big Picture. Richard Thieme illuminates how to do that.\n\nRichard Thieme is speaking for the seventh year at Def Con. He is a contributing editor for Information Security and has written for Wired, Forbes, Salon, and Secure Business Quarterly. He recently spoke for the FBI's Infragard Superconference, FS-ISAC and the Dept. of the Treasury as well as other hacker cons and numerous businesses and associations. His column Islands in the Clickstream is at www.thiemeworks.com."
