description: "It can take looking at a few thousand bugs, but eventually hacking feels like getting really good at telling the same joke, over and over again. It's OK, the computer still laughs, but why isn't software engineering delivering the reliability and predictability of other engineering disciplines?\n\nThat's a question with an answer. It's not an easy answer, like \"devs are lazy\" or \"tools are bad\". Who are hackers to complain about either? But it's an answer I intend to explore, in true hacker fashion, by seeing traditional boundaries as mostly false, but useful for identifying what to fuzz.\n\nWhy should we separate the humans that write bugs, from the tools the tools they use? Humans write tools. Why these tools in particular?\nWhy would we separate forward and reverse engineering, dev from test? Wait, are those the same thing? Does any other field isolate the creator from the consequences of their creation?\n\nIs this going to be just some fluffy exploratory keynote? No, this is way too long a flight for that. We're going to talk about where I think software and hardware architecture is going to go, with actual code you're welcome to try to break. I'll tell you exactly where to look."
