description: "Robert \"Hackajar\" Imhoff-Dousharm - Economics of Password Cracking in the GPU Era\nhttps://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-19/dc-19-presentations/Imhoff/DEFCON-19-Imhoff-Password-Cracking.pdf\n\nAs this shift to \"General Computing\" and working in the cloud has accelerated in the last 4 years, so has the ability to take advantage of these technologies from an Information Security vantage point. This could not be more apparent than with the sudden uptick in GPU based password cracking technologies. In this presentation we will explore where the current GPU cracking technologies are, what their cost are to implement, and how to deploy and execute them (with demo). Most importantly, we will demonstrate the \"brute force calculator\" which can assist with getting your monies worth. Finally, we will explore where the future lays for this medium and what that means for safe passwords moving into the next decade.\n\nRobert has been working in Information Security for over 12 years. In his travels he was one of the first to publicly demonstrate the downfalls of credit card security in merchant environments. Next, after 2 ? years of research, he demonstrated \"whitelist\" based IDPS technology embedded in within web based code to protect against and detect XSS and Injection Attacks in real-time. Later, he developed and implemented highly customized DNS logging integrated with real-time IDPS technology for protection against 0-day malware threats. He currently is working on a SV Hacker Space and various WiFi security shenanigans.\nTwitter: @hackajar\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/hackajar\nSkype: hackajar"
