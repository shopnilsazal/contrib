description: "This episode of the AI Show is the third in a series talking about the Azure ML Services. The new Azure Machine Learning Services provide an integrated, end-to-end data science experience. It enables data scientists to prepare data, develop experiments, and deploy models at cloud scale.\n\nIn this episode, you will use the Notebooks capability of Azure ML with a remote GPU compute (DSVM). You will use Pandas (Python), Scikit-Learn to train a Machine Learning model and create a deployable ML model.\n\nMore information here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/overview-what-is-azure-ml\n\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/azft-ai"
