description: "\"Streaming: Why should I care?\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - Anfiteatro 2]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nYou think, all that hype about streaming solutions does not affect you? I thought so also. But when playing around with that topic for some time, I realized that it sheds a different light on many topics I struggled with for some time. In this talk I want to share with you what I discovered when switching from a from a database centric view to stream oriented processing. \n\nSplitting your application in smaller services gets easier as you have more natural boundaries\nYou have more options to run different data schema versions in different services (instead of one central db upgrade)\nMore scaling possibilities\nOperations improvements\n\nFor sure, streaming does not solve any problem, but much more than I thought before. And in python you have good support with many streaming clients. I will give some examples and comparisons for working with Kafka and Avro Schemas.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
