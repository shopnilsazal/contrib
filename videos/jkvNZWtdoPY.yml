description: "Reflections on Adjusting Trust: The Mozilla Root Program Tales of running an open and transparent Certificate Authority Program\nby Gerv Markham\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nSeamless secure (TLS) connections on the internet are underpinned by the WebPKI - a system where Certificate Authorities (CAs) issue identity certificatesto people and sites, and clients such as browsers have a \"trusted root\" listof those they think will do that job right. Mozilla runs the only open andtransparently root program, which defines what Firefox (and probably yourLinux distro) trusts; this talk explains how we use that power to make theInternet a safer and more secure place.\n\n\nRoom: H.1301 (Cornil)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 11:40:00"
