title: 'Yucheng Low - SFrame - A Scalable, Out of Core Dataframe for Machine Learning'
recordingDate: 1430493431
description: "PyData Dallas 2015\nMachine learning is hard. Machine learning at scale is even harder. Scaling up machine learning requires not just advances in algorithm implementation, but also more scalable data structures. In this talk, we discuss the SFrame, one of the core data-structures of a new scalable Python machine learning platform called GraphLab Create. The SFrame was designed to enable the manipulation of tables with billions of rows and thousands of columns on a single machine while maintaining a high degree of performance. It shares many of Pandas and Numpy's capabilities, making it easy for Pandas users to get up to speed quickly. In this talk, I will demonstrate the capabilities of the SFrame and its companion datastructure, the SGraph, and discuss some of their architecture and design considerations.\nView slides for this presentation here: http://www.slideshare.net/dato-inc/pydata-talk-47680671"
