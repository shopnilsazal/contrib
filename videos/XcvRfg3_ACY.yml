title: '#HITB2016AMS D1T1 - Escape From The Docker KVM QEMU Machine - Shengping Wang and Xu Liu'
recordingDate: 1466484898
description: "KVM-Qemu and Docker containers are important components of virtualization technology and are widely used by mainstream cloud vendors.\n\nKVM-Qemu is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware which contains virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V) and devices emulated by QEMU in user components. Docker is an open-source and light-weight project that automates the development of applications inside software containers by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux servers. However, any vulnerabilities in these components will bring huge security risks to cloud computing system.\n\nDuring this talk we will break the session down into two parts – in Part 1, Shengping Wang we will cover Docker escape technologies which involves the following aspects:\n\nDocker’s implementation principles\nExploitation of Linux kernel vulnerabilities\nContainer escape technology\nNew methods of escape under the latest version of Docker\nSome amazing operations to kernel objects\nWe will show step-by-step how hackers can launch escape attacks and finally control the host to execute any command they want by utilizing Docker’s features and existing Linux kernel vulnerabilities.\n\nIn Part 2, Xu Liu will talk about QEMU escape technology in which the following topics (and more) will be covered:\n\nAnalysis of memory layout of QEMU process under QEMU + KVM environment\nSeveral amazing security vulnerabilities of QEMU device emulator which were found by 360 Marvel Team\nHow to escape from the virtual machine by making use of the vulnerabilities and special memory mapping features\nOther useful vulnerability exploitation methods of QEMU software.\nThis talk is brand-new and includes never before published material.\n\n======\n\nShengping Wang is a security expert of 360 Marvel Team, which is one of leading security researching teams from Qihoo 360. Shengping has years of working experience in security research and development, mainly about security researching in virtualization and cloud platforms, such like escape and defense technologies in Docker and KVM. Recently, he is leading the development of one virtualization security product for 360 Enterprise Security.\n\n------\n\nXu Liu, now he is an security researching expert of 360 Marvel Team, which is one of leading security researching teams in China. Xu Liu has rich experience in security researching, especially in virtualization platform security, such as escape and defense technologies in Docker, Qemu, Xen platforms etc. Right now, Xu Liu is focusing on providing related defense strategies for Qihoo360’s virtualization security products."
