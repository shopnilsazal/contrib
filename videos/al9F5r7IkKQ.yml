description: "Scaling to 5000+ Unique K8s Deployments, How We Did It [I] - Nicole Hubbard, WP Engine\n\nMost organizations only need to run a couple deployments of their application in Kubernetes. In these situations, deploying onto Kubernetes clusters is relatively straightforward. What happens when you need to simultaneously deploy 5,000 unique instance of your application to different Kubernetes clusters at different providers worldwide?\n\nOver the last year, we have worked to move over 60,000 of our customers' unique workloads from virtual machines onto Kubernetes. I will share our experiences on how to automate and simplify managing unique Kubernetes workloads at scale.\n\nAbout Nicole Hubbard\nNicole Hubbard is an Architect at WP Engine where she focuses on building container based infrastructure, automation and helping teams deploy their applications."
