In this GDC Europe 2015 session tinyBuild's Mike Rose (Party Hard) will explore how video games have tackled bluffing and feinting, with plenty of input from the game designers who have stormed the bluffing beaches, to learn which elements have worked best in digital form.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
