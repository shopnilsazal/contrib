description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2016 in Washington, DC\nhttps://2016.appsecusa.org/\n\nBarbarians at the Gate(way)\n\nThis talk will examine the tools, methods and data behind the DDoS and web attacks against cloud platforms and traditional architectures that are prevalent in the news headlines.\n\nUsing collected information, the presentation will demonstrate what the attackers are using to cause their mischief & mayhem, and examine the timeline and progression of attackers as they move from the historical page defacers to the motivated attacker.\n\nWe will look at their motivations and rationale and try to give you some sort of understanding of what patterns to be aware of for your own protection.\n\nDave Lewis\nGlobal Security Advocate, Akamai Technologies\nDave Lewis has almost two decades of industry experience.
