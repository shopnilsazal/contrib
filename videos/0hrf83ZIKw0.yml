description: "\"Fast product development using Django Rest Framework. #lessonslearned\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-13 - PyCharm Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nA year ago we decided to use Django and, specifically, DRF as the cornerstone of our upcoming fast-iterating web platform. In this talk I discuss why and how the architecture has evolved, key decisions made and the lessons we learned along the way.\n\nI'll share the techniques we used for iterating quickly and how the technology supported (and shaped) them. In addition some quirks and DRF-specific tricks will be brought along the way.\n\nExpect a general talk about how Python (and specifically DRF) can be used as a based for quick product iterations, a discussion regarding how to build and evolve a platform to meet those needs and some DRF-specific tidbits. No previous knowledge is required but experience in web development will make the content more accessible.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
