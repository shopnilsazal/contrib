title: 'An inconvenient Zeus: The rise of Saas targeted malware - Ami Luttwak'
recordingDate: 1392270505
description: "We at Adallom are proposing a 20 minute session where we will showcase a new variant of Zeus which we have found in the wild that specifically targets Salesforce.com users. It remains dormant until the user logs in to SFDC and then discretely piggybacks on the user session, downloads data, and uploads it to a Dropbox account. We will do a live demonstration of an attack as well as show that Salesforce.com shows no record of the attack, meaning it can execute very clandestinely.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
