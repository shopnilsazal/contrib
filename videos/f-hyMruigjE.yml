description: "Ian Mercer\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2016/netfringe/sfcxqr/\n\"For over 10 years I've spent a fair amount of my spare time creating what may well be the \"\"World's Smartest House\"\" and it's all in C# .NET. My code controls almost everything that can be controlled in the house, it speaks, it chats with you on messenger or Slack, it saves energy, it includes a multi-zone audio player, it consults the weather and adjusts the thermostats in an optimal way, ...\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll detail some of what it does, some of how I built it, and maybe a bit of why I did it. I'll talk about the challenges of building software in .NET that has to run 24x7, maybe mention some of my favorite Nuget packages, and I'll try to touch on the future and where I think smart homes are headed.\r\n\r\nI'll also plug my Natural Language Engine for .NET that makes powerful chat bots easy, and my .NET Hierarchical State Machine that makes complex control logic a bit easier.\r\n\r\nIf I have time I'll also show you how I do multiple-inheritance in C# and how I persist objects with no entity classes and no POCOs, just interfaces! I might also touch on Expressions and Expression Visitors, my own Rx and variables-with-history that know what value they had yesterday or even last year.\r\n\r\nRead my blog before you come and bring your pressing smart home questions.\""
