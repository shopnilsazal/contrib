description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nEfficient IoT with Protocol Buffers and gRPC - Vladimir Vivien, {code} (Beginner Skill Level)\n\nBuilding IoT applications that scales with a variety of devices and capabilities, such as network bandwidth, processor, and power consumption, can be a challenge. Furthermore, this can be complicated with a heterogenous development environment with a multitude of languages, communication frameworks, and protocols. This talk discusses how Protocol Buffers, a language and platform neutral serialization mechanism, can be used as an efficient protocol for small embedded devices with constrained bandwidth and power. We will demonstrate how gRPC, along with Protocol Buffers, provides a performant communication framework that can be used across diverse languages and device platforms to create realtime IoT applications.\n\nAbout Vladmir\nVladimir Vivien is a software engineer and author of the book \"\"Learning Go Programming\"\". Currently he works at VMware as a staff engineer in the Cloud Native Application group where he spends time promoting and contributing to open source including Kubernetes."
