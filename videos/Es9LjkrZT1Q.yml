description: "Colin Newell\n\nA practical demonstration of exploiting a Python web application to help illustrate the potential damage a security hole can cause.\n\nI'll discuss how the the accretion of risk leads to compromise.\n\nThe demonstration will be with an application constructed for this talk, using well respected libraries in an apparently secure fashion (mostly). This will not present any new or novel techniques, nor will it critique existing libraries.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1edFsGyEihKJZwaJAJBaJ9yDPWpOVfGZmaA7LkF3VinA/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.p"
