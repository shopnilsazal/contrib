Elixir and Ruby programmer. Father, book devourer, dark beer lover. I think the concept of a delightful user experience should be applied to all parts of life including software libraries, developer tools, APIs, and web UIs in technology as well the onboarding experience for someone into in a new group. I'm passionate about communication between people, both direct and through the use of technology (eg. UX in software). I care about deeply about ways to improve our connections through methods such things as conflict resolution and Nonviolent Communication."
