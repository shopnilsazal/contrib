description: 'There are some exciting new developments happening in the web platform right now. New APIs such as CSS Grid, Web Components, Custom CSS Properties and the Web Animation API. Each on their own is a complex topic worth getting to grips with but what this talk aims to show is how they can be used with each other when used together the result is greater than the sum of its parts. There is only a brief introduction to each topic so some prior knowledge for Web Animations, Custom Properties, CSS Grid and Web Components would help but is not required.'
