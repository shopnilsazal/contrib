description: "Deploying Kubernetes Without Scaring Off Your Security Team [I] - Paul CzarkowskI, Pivotal & Major Hayden, Rackspace\n\nsubtitle: \"The Major Hayden Center For Kubernauts Who Can't Security Good And Wanna Learn To Do Other Stuff Good Too\"\n\nOne of the larger roadblocks we face in the enterprise when trying to adopt new technologies is getting the security and compliance teams onboard. \n\nTools like kubicorn and kubeadm are likely the foundation on which Kubernetes deployments will be performed in the future as they help simplify the deployment and operations of Kubernetes a very complex distributed system. \n\nHowever concerns about security and compliance, which are not as yet addressed by those tools, may act as inhibitors and road blocks to using these them and thus Kubernetes in the enterprise.\n\nThankfully the techniques and tools for deploying Enterprise Linux distributions, securing them, and ensuring compliance already exist and can be very easily combined with kubernetes.\n\nIn this talk weâ€™ll expand upon these enterprise requirements and use cases and show how we can use existing Ansible tooling to deploy kubernetes on bare metal or the cloud, monitor it with common enterprise monitoring tools, secure it with a 2fa SSH bastion, and ensure [DISA STIG] compliance.\n\nAbout Paul Czarkowski\nPaul Czarkowski is a recovering Systems Administrator who has run infrastructure for longer than he cares to admit. After cutting his teeth in the ISP and Gaming industries Paul changed his focus to using (and contributing to) Open Source Software to improve the Operability of complex distributed systems such as Kubernetes and OpenStack. Oh and he makes the best Queso in Texas.\n\nAbout Major Hayden\nMajor Hayden is a principal architect at Rackspace and lives just outside San Antonio, Texas. He automates infrastructure deployments while improving security along the way. He runs icanhazip.com and blogs on major.io. Don't give him new ideas for domain names -- he owns far too many.\n\nWhen he's not at work, he tinkers with amateur radio (W5WUT), reads lots of books, and runs 5Ks from time to time."
