description: 'Most software product organization eventually wrestle with the challenge of refactoring and evolving the architecture, design and code of their products and platforms. Over time code size and complexity increase as successive layers of code, features, integrations, are introduced. Systems become more and more brittle and susceptible to failure, product life cycles grow longer as more safety checks are added in an effort to prevent breakages, and the organization becomes increasingly cautious and uncertain when making changes â€“ further slowing and constraining time to market, and ultimately creating an unvirtuous cycle. One of the biggest challenges in large systems is knowing where to start and how to proceed. This talk will describe proven technical and organizational approaches to modernizing extant systems architectures and code.'
