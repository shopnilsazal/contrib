description: 'Java developers who start with front-end these days have a tough time choosing and adapting to the front-end landscape due to the plethora of different choices available. In this talk, I will walk you through different aspects to consider when choosing between Angular, React & VueJS and will also show how to quickly start being productive with these by using tools like JHipster, Angular-CLI & create-react-app. I will talk about my experience building Angular & React support in JHipster and how you can apply common patterns and use Typescript to apply your Java Knowledge in the front end world.'
