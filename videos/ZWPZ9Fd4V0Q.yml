title: 'Ruby Conf 2011 Parallel Testing World by Shota, Fukumori'
recordingDate: 1323722264
description: 'Ruby (MRI) has an unit-testing library, ''test/unit''. This is used for ruby''s `make test-all`. In February 2011, I committed a patch ("parallel_test") that allows us to run multiple Test::Unit::TestCase-s at the same time. Because of this patch, ruby''s `make test-all` can run tests faster. This patch also affects to existing tests using `test/unit`. In this talk, I take you into the parallel testing world. We''ll talk about general parallel testing, benefits of parallel testing, multi-threaded or multi-process, etc. Then talk about the patch, the story of making the patch and describe how the patch works.'
