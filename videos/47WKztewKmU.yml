He reveals early prototypes, mediates on the lessons learned, discusses the difficulties involved in making sure that both titan and pilot understand exactly what is happening during rodeo, and details what convinced them of the necessity to make large, sweeping changes to rodeo for Titanfall 2.\n\n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
