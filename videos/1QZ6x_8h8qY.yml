description: "Serverless on Kubernetes with Kubeless [A] - Sebastien Goasguen, Bitnami & Nguyen Anh-Tu, Skippbox\n\nServerless is getting lots of attention lately. It is positioned as the next evolution for building distributed applications, going beyond container based systems and letting developers build applications workflows based on triggers and events. The three main public clouds (GCP, Azure and AWS) all have serverless offerings. In this talk we will introduce kubeless, a serverless framework built on top of Kubernetes. It allows Kubernetes users to define functions that are dynamically injected in container runtimes and exposed via HTTP or event triggers. Events are managed by Apache Kafka while HTTP triggers are exposed with Kubernetes services. It is an open source clone of Google cloud functions, and provide similar capabilities than AWS lambda. We will explain kubeless architecture, show how we leverage ThirdPartyResources and an in-cluster controller. Above the interest of serverless, this architecture shows the power of Kubernetes and how it can be used as a platform to build new systems quickly.\n\nAbout Sebastien Goasguen\nSebastien Goasguen is a twenty year open source veteran. A member of the Apache SoftwareFoundation, he worked on Apache CloudStack and Libcloud for several years before diving into the container world. He was the founder of Skippbox, a Kubernetes startup that develops open source tools for Kubernetes users and is now the Senior Director of Cloud Technologies at Bitnami. An avid blogger he enjoys spreading the word about new cutting edge technologies and also trains developers and sysadmins on all things Docker and Kubernetes. Sebastien is the author of the Oâ€™Reilly Docker Cookbook and 60 Recipes for Apache CloudStack.\n\nAbout Nguyen Anh Tu\nNguyen Anh Tu (Tuna) - Software engineer @ Bitnami. A Distributed System enthusiast. Current interests include containerization, microservices, PaaS, serverless. Favorite programming language: Go."
