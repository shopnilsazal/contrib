description: "PyData Carolinas 2016\n\nLearn to deploy your research as a web application. You have been using Jupyter and Python to do some interesting research, build models, visualize results. In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to easily go from a notebook to a Flask web application which you can share.\n\nJupyter is a great notebook environment for Python based data science and exploratory data analysis. You can share the notebooks via a github repository, as html or even on the web using something like JupyterHub. How can we turn the work we have done in the notebook into a real web application?"
