description: "Honza Král - Beyond the basics with Elasticsearch\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nElasticsearch has many use cases, some of them fairly obvious and\nwidely used, like plain searching through documents or analytics. In\nthis talk I would like to go through some of the more advanced\nscenarios we have seen in the wild. Some examples of what we will\ncover:\n\nTrend detection - how you can use the aggregation framework to go\nbeyond simple \"counting\" and make use of the full-text properties of\nElasticsearch.\n\nPercolator - percolator is reversed search and many people use it as\nsuch to drive alerts or \"stored search\" functionality for their\nwebsite, let's look at how we can use it to detect languages, geo\nlocations or drive live search.\n\nIf we end up with some time to spare we can explore some other ideas\nabout how we can utilize the features of a search engine to drive non-\ntrivial data analysis including Geo-enabled search with relevancy."
