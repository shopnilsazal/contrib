description: "PyData London 2014\n\nThe UK has one of strongest digital economies in the world, yet the size and scope of this space is poorly understood through conventional classification systems and datasets. This is not only important for economists but for the people affected by Government policy. In this talk, we will provide an overview of the work Growth Intelligence has done in generating our own classification system to describe businesses using web-based data and python tools and techniques -- including the challenges we still face. We will also look at some situations in which traditional methods fall short of a data driven approach."
