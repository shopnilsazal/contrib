description: "This presentation will cover various topics involved with hacking video games. It will start off with how hacking video games can lead to a career in the security industry. It will then dive into various activities involved with hacking video games from higher level topics such as analyzing relevant business risks and threat modeling down to lower level things like how to change values in memory to gain unlimited ammo in a first-person shooter. Both client side attacks and network-based attacks will be discussed. Common attacks and corresponding protection mechanisms will be covered. Overall, this presentation will cover assessment topics and techniques relevant to assessing many types of software, both related to the video game industry as well as many other industries.\n\nThis presentation has a decent amount of higher level material aimed more at the business level audience members, but will also cover some lower level material that more technical people should enjoy.\n\nCarter Jones\nCigital\nSenior Security Consultant\nCarter Jones is a senior security consultant at Cigital, who has experience both as a consultant and a security researcher.
