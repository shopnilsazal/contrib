recordingDate: 1383941859
description: "Adrian Crenshaw - Programmable HID USB Keystroke Dongle: Using the Teensy as a Pen Testing Device\nThe Programmable HID USB Keystroke Dongle (PHUKD) is a small device based around the Teensy microcontroller development board. It allows users to program in keystrokes and mouse macros that can execute when the device is plugged in, after a set time, or when certain environmental conditions are met (light, noise, temperature, etc.) This device can be used as a replacement for a U3 hacksaw, as a device left behind to execute commands when someone with elevated privileges is likely to be logged in, or give as a Trojan device to unsuspecting targets. Much pwnage should ensue.\n\nAdrian Crenshaw has worked in the IT industry for the last twelve years. He runs the information security website Irongeek.com, which specializes in videos and articles that illustrate how to use various pen-testing and security tools.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
