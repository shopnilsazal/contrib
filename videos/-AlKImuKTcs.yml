description: "Francesc Alted - New Trends In Storing Large Data Silos With Python\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nMy talk is meant to provide an overview of our current set of tools\nfor storing data and how we arrived to these.  Then, in the light of\nthe current bottlenecks, and how hardware and software are evolving,\nprovide a brief overview of the emerging technologies that will be\nimportant for handling Big Data within Python.  Although I expect my\ntalk to be a bit prospective, I won't certainly be trying to predict\nthe future, but rather showing a glimpse on what I expect we would be\ndoing in the next couple of years for properly leveraging modern\narchitectures (bar unexpected revolutions ;).\n\nAs an example of library adapting to recent trends in hardware, I will\nbe showing bcolz (https://github.com/Blosc/bcolz), which implements a\ncouple of data containers (and specially a chunked, columnar 'ctable')\nmeant for storing large datasets efficiently."
