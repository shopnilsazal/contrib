description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Yannick Lemin, TechYOS.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-54\nSlides link: https://speakerdeck.com/theyann/the-sounds-of-android-androidmakers-2018\n\nSound on Android is a topic that is rarely covered, which is why I wanted to shed some lights in my experience with the sound management APIs on Android.\n\nSo in this talk, we'll touch on how sounds actually work programmatically, and we'll talk about how to play a sound on Android in the most simple way. We will also cover the principle of sound focus, what it is, how and when to use it. We'll see what we can do with MIDI as well. And finally, we'll go deeper in the rabbit hole and get introduced to the lower levels of sounds processing with the help of OpenSL ES and the SuperPowered library.\n\nLet's bring the noise.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
