recordingDate: 1464386336
description: "Craig Sebenik, Matterport\n\nMany large companies have strong SRE teams that are a great example to follow. But, applying the techniques seen at larger companies to a smaller company has many challenges. Bringing about change is a combination of culture shifts as well as technical challenges. In this talk, I will discuss many of the concepts that worked at LinkedIn and how I have gradually implemented them over the past year and a half at a start-up."
