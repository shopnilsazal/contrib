title: '#HITB2018AMS D2T2 - Over The Edge: Pwning The Windows Kernel - Rancho Han'
recordingDate: 1524904918
description: "The Microsoft Windows graphics subsystem is a huge and complex subsystem that contains some extremely important components such as the font engine, window manager, graphics device interface and more. In recent years, we have seen several nice kernel exploits such as CVE-2015-2455 (TTF), CVE-2016-0173 (Surface), CVE-2017-8465 (Cursor) and itâ€™s clear that Microsoft is constantly increasing the mitigations for the Windows kernel.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, Tencent ZhanluLab started to look into the Windows graphics subsystem for sandbox escapes and to date we have discovered 15+ kernel vulnerabilities and successfully exploited Windows 10 from the Edge sandbox several times. This talk will be divided into two parts.\n\nIn the first part, we will explain in detail how we analyze the graphics subsystem in depth and discuss several special attack vectors we have found.\n\nIn the second part, will discuss the syscall filter mechanism of the Edge sandbox and introduce three methods to escape from the sandbox to SYSTEM from the Edge content process. These include:\n\n1. Analyzing object actions from the unfiltered syscall functions\n2. Abusing a bug in the Chakra engine to bypass syscall filters\n3. Fuzzing the DxgkInterface functions\n\nWe have written full exploits for each method and the details of these vulnerabilities will also be disclosed in the presentation.\n\n=== \n\nRancho Han is a senior security researcher of Tencent Zhanlu Lab (@ZhanluLab). He has more than six years of information security experience. In the past years, his work involved malware detection, exploit mitigations, and bug hunting. Recently, he focused on the research of windows kernel fuzzing and exploit technique.\n\nHe had participated in Pwn2Own 2017 (as Tencent Security Lance Team), exploited MicroSoft Edge with SYSTEM privilege in less than 1 second."
