title: 'Go and Ruby `by Eleanor McHugh'
recordingDate: 1323742288
description: 'Go is a statically-compiled systems language geared to developing scalable and type-safe applications whilst leveraging type inference to approximate the light touch of a dynamic language. It could be characterised as the static-typing world''s response to Ruby. In this session we''re going to explore the Go language, its tool-chain and idioms such as CSP-based concurrency and dynamically inferred interfaces to see how they influence the design of Go applications. We''ll compare these to equivalent Ruby idioms where they exist, model Go-style concurrency in pure MRI Ruby, and look at interoperability between the two languages. Along the way we''ll meet gotest (Go''s testing and benchmarking framework), CGO (for linking to C libraries), goinstall (the remote package installer) and Go''s powerful reflection and type manipulation features. There''ll be a good mix of Go and Ruby code so that by the end of the session you''ll be comfortable reading Go source code, have a basic feel for developing with the language and the necessary background to start using Go components in your dev projects.'
