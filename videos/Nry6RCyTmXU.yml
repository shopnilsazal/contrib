description: "Anyone moving to Rails 4 has seen the documented examples like this: params.require(:coffee).permit(:all, :the, :things). But if the codebase has multiple controllers (including a few over 1000 lines long), some api endpoints, nested attributes nesting inside attributes that are named things like additional_attributes_attributes, and robust test coverage that has likely caused forbidden attribute grief, then this talk about some of the little/not documented details of the parameters we call strong might be your cup of...coffee.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HLd1/"
