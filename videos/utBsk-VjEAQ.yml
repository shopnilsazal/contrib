description: "\"Much of what we want to do with data involves optimization: whether it's to find a model that best fits the data, or to decide on the optimal action given some information.\n\nWe'll explore the embarrassment of riches Python offers to tackle custom optimization problems: the scipy.optimize package, Sympy for calculus and code generation, Cython for speedups and binding to external libraries.\""
