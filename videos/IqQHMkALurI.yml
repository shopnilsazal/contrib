description: "In Japan, we held 5 competitions called Mini Hardening. Those were derived by original Hardening Project which is constructed by 8 hours playing time and 8 hours reflection time through 2 days. Our one is a bit of different but only using 1 day. The another difference is that we focused on beginners and novices.\nWe have to consider business continuity regarding our investigation and operations when security incident happened. Sometimes operation could be affected to their own business such as password changing. So, we are evaluating scores by using report document. It's technical competition but hard to win without considering about business exactly what it is.\nOn the other hand, original competition is too hard for beginners to participate by its difficulties and costs. That's why I made own competition. Through my this presentation, I will provide my all experiences how to lead own volunteer team, to create lots of environments, to introduce security for beginners.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
