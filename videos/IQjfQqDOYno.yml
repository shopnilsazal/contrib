description: "PyData London 2018\n\nVisualising Natural Language Processing pipelines can be tricky, especially at scale. In this talk I will introduce Pynorama â€“ a visualisation system that is written in Python, easy to setup, scalable, extensible, highly interactive and allows you to browse, analyse and understand your datasets and machine learning models.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/slavimarinov/20180428-pydata-natural-language-processing-with-pynorama\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
