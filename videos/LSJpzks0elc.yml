description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nLightning Talk: I Got your RBAC - kube-rbac-proxy - Frederic Branczyk, CoreOS (Any Skill Level)\n\nKubernetes RBAC is great for authorizing requests to the Kubernetes API, and is a vital component for a secure Kubernetes cluster. Wouldn't it be great to use RBAC to authorize requests to your applications as well? In this lighting talk, Frederic will showcase kube-rbac-proxy, the tool he developed just for this use case. While operating his own Kubernetes cluster, the need came about to protect applications that don't have native authentication and authorization means to utilize the methods available by Kubernetes.\n\nAbout Frederic\nFrederic is an engineer at CoreOS contributing to Prometheus and Kubernetes to build state of the art modern infrastructure and monitoring tools. He discovered his interest in monitoring tools and distributed systems in his previous jobs, where he used machine learning to detect anomalies indicating intrusion attempts. He also worked on projects involving secrets management for distributed applications to build sane and stable infrastructure."
