description: "Attacking TPM Part 2: A Look at the ST19WP18 TPM Device\nChris Tarnovsky Flylogic, Inc.\n\nThe STMicroelectronics ST19WL18P TPM die-level analysis. Companies like Atmel, Infineon and ST are pushing motherboard manufacturers to use these devices. End-users trust these devices to hold passwords and other secrets. Once more, I will show you just how insecure these devices are.\n\nChristopher 'Biggun' Tarnovsky owns Flylogic, Inc. and specializes in analysis of semiconductors from a security \"how strong is it really\" standpoint. Flylogic offers detailed reports on substrate attacks which define if a problem exists. If a problem is identified, we explain in a detailed report all aspects of how the attack was done, level of complexity and so on. This is something we believe is unique and allows the customer to then go back to the chip vendor armed with the knowledge to make them make it better (or possibly use a different part)."
