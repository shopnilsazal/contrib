description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nFunction Composition in a Serverless World - Erwin van Eyk & Timirah James, Platform9 (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nAs serverless applications grow more complex, function _composition_, or the ability for functions to call each other, becomes important. This talk will dive into three different approaches to compose FaaS functions together to form large applications: _Coordinating Functions_ are functions that manage the execution of other functions by calling them directly. _Event-driven Composition_ uses functions emitting and reacting to events on message queue topics. _Workflows_ introduce a mechanism for expressing a graph of function interactions and having a new runtime to manage the execution of these functions. We'll give examples and live demos for each approach, and compare then on the basis of expressiveness, performance, and fault-tolerance; and also on the basis of operational concerns, such as the ease of doing upgrades, and monitoring the overall application's performance.\n\nAbout Erwin\nErwin is a software engineer at Platform9 Inc, where he works on a workflow engine for Fission, a FaaS on top of Kubernetes. At the same time, he is a researcher investigating “Function Composition in FaaS Deployments” in the International Research Team @large, from his office at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Additionally, he leads the industry and academia combined FaaS research effort at the SPEC Cloud Research Group.\n\nAbout Timirah\nTimirah James is a Developer Advocate for Platform9 Systems’ FaaS, Fission, which is built on top of Kubernetes. She is best known for being a thought leader in the Los Angeles and Silicon Beach tech community, her active roles in the hackathon realm, as well as mentoring through her meetup (TechniGal LA) for women exploring the world of STEM. Fun Fact: She is also a noted singer-songwriter, and recently released a song about her love for technology and innovation called “Coderitis”, which can be found on Soundcloud and Spotify!"
