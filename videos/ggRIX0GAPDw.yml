description: "PyData New York City 2017 \n\nModern data analysis pipelines routinely involve gluing together multiple systems and languages: SQL, Python, R, C++, unix tools, and more. This leads to unnecessary complexity and inefficiency. JuliaDB is a fast, productivity-focused, distributed database that, together with the Julia language, forms a single coherent system for everything from data preparation to machine learning with no glue."
