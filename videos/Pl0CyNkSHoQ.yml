description: "Has it ever happened to you on a Friday afternoon, just before closing your laptop, tidying your desk before a long weekend? A weekend that indeed looks now very long in perspective? A server disappeared! A network device that blinks mysteriously and frantically like a Christmas tree. No clues yet to be found? Feeling like calling Watson? Call no one but become Sherlock himself to uncover the truth!\n\nThis session will reveal some of Moriarty’s machinations and some cyber forensics techniques you can use to identify all the clues left over and finally solve the puzzle quickly (before your weekend runs over). Some of the tools of deduction will include:\n\n– remotely pulling the puppet strings\n\n– unlocking the secrets of a locked box\n\n– anticipating the enemy’s first move\n\n– set a decoy to expose the stratagem\n\n===\n\nNicolas Collery has been in the security field for over 15 years, focusing on fighting cybercrime. Passionate about forensics, malware analysis, and now simulating attacks focusing on real-adversaries tactics, techniques and procedure to assess capability to prevent, detect and respond. He has worked on the implementation of some of the current security controls that helps providing security and peace of mind to its customers."
