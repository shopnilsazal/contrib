description: "Information Overload and the Real Cost of Interruptions - Hannah Foxwell, Pivotal\n\nTime is our most precious resource and we’re not using it well. Our attention and our time are being fought over all day every day, and no one is immune to this type of “digital disruption”. In this talk, we’ll look at our evolving relationship with technology and what impact it has on company culture, job satisfaction, productivity and our mental health. We'll also explore some of the ways we can create healthier digital environments in the context of software engineering. Environments where we use our tools to collaborate whilst recognising our need to concentrate. \n\nAbout Hannah Foxwell\nHannah Foxwell is Delivery Manager at Pivotal and HumanOps champion. In large scale enterprises and technology start ups Hannah has always sought to create an environment where engineers can do their best work. This naturally lead to a keen interest in DevOps and Continuous Delivery as she witnessed the positive Human impact these technical practices can have on the teams who adopt them. Hannah continues this work today at Pivotal, helping teams transform how they deliver software."
