description: "Final Fantasy XIV was successfully relaunched as Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn in 2013 after the inauspicious release in 2010 - a first in MMORPG history. In this GDC 2014 presentation, Square Enix's Naoki Yoshida analyzes the causes of the initial failures, and discloses some of the behind-the-scenes decisions/thoughts surrounding the importance of a relaunch, the creation of an MMORPG title within the short span of 2 years and 9 months, and the commitment to a specific business model.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
