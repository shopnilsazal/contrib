description: "Using Containers for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery [I] - Carlos Sanchez, CloudBees\n\nBuilding and testing is a great use case for containers, both due to the dynamic and isolation aspects, but it increases complexity when scaling to multiple nodes and clusters.\n\nJenkins is an example of an application that can take advantage of Kubernetes technology to run Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery workloads. Jenkins and Kubernetes can be integrated to transparently use on demand containers to run build agents and jobs, and isolate job execution. It also supports CI/CD-as-code using Jenkins Pipelines and automated deployments to Kubernetes clusters. The presentation will allow a better understanding of how to use Jenkins on Kubernetes for container based, totally dynamic, large scale CI and CD.\n\nAbout Carlos Sanchez\nCarlos Sanchez specializes in software automation, from build tools to Continuous Delivery. He has spoken at several conferences around the world, including ApacheCON, JavaOne, Fosdem,... Involved in Open Source for more than ten years, he is the author of the Jenkins Kubernetes plugin and a member of the Apache Software Foundation amongst other open source groups, contributing to several projects, such as Jenkins, Apache Maven, or Puppet. He works at CloudBees scaling the Jenkins platform."
