title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2013 - Stuart Sierra - Data, Visibility & Abstraction - Development Using Clojure'
recordingDate: 1380912004
description: "One reason programming is hard is because it is so difficult to observe what is happening when a program runs. Programming languages and libraries rely on abstractions which either hide important details or produce too much information to consume. Developers come to depend on ever-more-sophisticated tools to examine programs and diagnose failures. However, with a little care and design, it is possible to build systems which lend themselves to easier comprehension. This talk will introduce some general guidelines for designing systems which make their data and abstractions more transparent to developers, using code examples in Clojure.\n\nFor more on YOW!
