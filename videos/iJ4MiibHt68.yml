description: "PyData Chicago 2016\n\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/secret/dvt9zZBUVz7b7X\nGithub: https://github.com/esander91\nCode: https://github.com/esander91/GoodEnoughAlgs.\n\nEvolutionary algorithms let us tackle all kinds of impossible problems. Want to design a short delivery route, but there are more possible solutions than atoms in the universe? Well, evolutionary algorithms can't promise to find the optimal solution, but can guarantee finding a pretty great one. I'll give an overview of these algorithms, and how you can use them for your own impossible problems."
