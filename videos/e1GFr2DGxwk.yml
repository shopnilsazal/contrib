description: "konarkmodi - Design considerations while Evaluating, Developing, Deploying a distributed task processing system\n[EuroPython 2014]\n[23 July 2014]\n\nWith the growing world of web, there are numerous use-cases which require tasks to be executed in an asynchronous manner and in a distributed fashion. \nCelery is one of the most robust, scalable, extendable and easy-to-implement frameworks available for distributed task processing. While developing applications using Celery, I have had considerable experience in terms of what design choices one should be aware of while evaluating an existing system or developing one's own system from scratch."
