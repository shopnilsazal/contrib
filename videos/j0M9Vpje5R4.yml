description: "What is it that makes writing secure software so difficult? Why do we keep making the same mistakes over and over again? One challenge is that developers are busy delivering features and meeting deadlines – giving security requirements less priority.\n\nIn this talk you’ll learn to use principles and mindsets from Domain Driven Design combined with a pinch of security awareness, to create secure code – while still focusing on your business features.\n\nYou’ll learn the basic principles of Secure by Design and how to use concepts such as Domain Primitives and Entity Snapshots to harden your code. What a Domain DoS attack is, and how to incorporate security testing in your delivery pipeline. The ideas and tools presented are directly applicable in your daily work."
