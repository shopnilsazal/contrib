description: "AppSecEU 2014 in Cambridge\nhttps://2014.appsec.eu/\n\nDevelopers want to write code and security testers want to break it and both groups have specialized tools supporting these goals. The problem is -- security testers need to know more about application code to do better testing and developers need to be able to quickly address problems found by security testers. This presentation looks at both groups and their respective toolsets and explores ways they can help each other out. \n\nTwo different interactions are examined: \n• How can knowledge of code make application scanning better? \n• How can application scan results be mapped back to specific lines of code? \n\nUsing open source examples built on OWASP ZAP, ThreadFix and Eclipse, the presentation walks through the process of seeding web applications scans with knowledge gleaned from code analysis as well as the mapping of dynamic scan results to specific line of code. The end result is a combination of testing and remediation workflows that help both security testers and software developers be more effective. Particular attention is give to Java/JSP applications and Java/Spring applications and how teams using these frameworks can best benefit from these interactions.\nSpeakers\n\nDan Cornell\nCTO, Denim Group\nDan Cornell has over twelve years of experience architecting and developing web-based software systems.
