recordingDate: 1352494591
description: "There's a lot to love about JRuby. It performs better than just about any other implementation. It has solid, reliable, parallel threading. Its extensions are managed code and won't segfault or interfere with threads or GC. And it gives Ruby access to anything that can run on a JVM, including code written in other languages.\n\nBut how does it work? More importantly, why does it work so well?\n\nThis talk will dig into the nitty-gritty details of how JRuby takes advantage of JVM optimization, threading, GC, and language integration. We'll show why Ruby works so well on top of the JVM and what it means for you. And we'll explore the future of the JVM and how it will make JRuby even better (and JRubyists even happier).\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGfV/"
