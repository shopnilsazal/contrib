description: "by Jan-Simon Möller\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nLAVA and Fuego are great tools individually already. Combining and extendingthem allows for a much broader test coverage than each tool alone can provide.In this presentation, Jan-Simon Möller will present the features of thecombined infrastructure and highlight the tools and work done to integrateboth tools. Also in focus is how to distribute the test infrastructure acrossmultiple sites to include more boards. In the end we'll discuss the lessonslearned and future developments.\n\nThe focus of this talk is to share the experiences made and lessons learned soppl can integrate such tools better in their own environment. It also raisesthe pain-points and open issues when setting up a distributed environment.\n\nEspecially for Automotive, Long-Term-Support, CIP or Consumer Electronics,advancing the Test-harness is essential to raise the bar and strengthen theconfidence in our embedded platforms. Automated testing can improve ourecosystem from two sides: during development (feature does work _and_ does notbreak things) and during maintenance (no regressions through backports).\n\n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 14:30:00"
