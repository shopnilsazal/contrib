description: "How many hours have you wasted building awesome software that nobody uses?\n\nIt's one of the biggest frustrations for developers, and managers trying to keep developers. But there is a solution. User testing is a simple way to keep product development on course. And it's not just for big companies with big budgets.\n\nIn this talk I'll introduce a simple no-frills approach to usability testing tailored specifically for engineers. We'll discuss how to interpret results, and finally how to incorporate the results back into the development cycle.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG5n/"
