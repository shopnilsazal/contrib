description: "React is a fairly new UI library for JavaScript. Yes, there’s literally a ton of those around, but React is a product of out-of-the-box thinking and does things a bit differently than most of the others.\nAll the cool people are using React these days, so let’s jump on that bandwagon and add some more buzzwords (mobile! Topcoat!) for good measure. This talk will give you a quick introduction to what React can do and show you how to write simple components, and we'll take a quick look at how you can make sure your components don’t crash and burn on mobile."
