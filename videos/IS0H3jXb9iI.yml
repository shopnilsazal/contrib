description: "Code to Joy by: Avdi Grimm\n\nI got into Ruby because writing it made me happy, and after all these years it still finds ways to make me grin. Join me for a random walk through the Ruby language and standard library, stopping in to visit some of my favorite tools, hacks and implementation patterns. Some you may know. Others may be more obscure. My goal: to rekindle in you the joy of code, to inspire you to share that joy with your peers and with the next generation of developers, and most importantly, to bring a smile to your face!"
