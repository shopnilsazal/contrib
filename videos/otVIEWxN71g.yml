description: "Ships that pass in the night, and speak each other in passing,\nOnly a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness;\nSo on the ocean of life, we pass and speak one another,\nOnly a look and a voice, then darkness again and a silence.\n\nâ€“ Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, 1863\n\n- - -\n\nThis video was sponsored by the DevTips Patron Community - https://www.patreon.com/DevTips\n\nListen to Travis' Podcast - http://www.travandlos.com/\n\nGet awesomeness emailed to you every thursday - http://travisneilson.com/notes \n\nYou should follow DevTips on Twitter - https://twitter.com/DevTipsShow"
