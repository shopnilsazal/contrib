title: 'The Language of Actors by Vaughn Vernon'
language: English
recordingDate: 1501628586
description: 'Is the Actor Model just a new "shiny object" for developers to chase after, a fad soon to be abandoned? Actually the Actor Model is almost as old as the formal definition of object-oriented programming, and addresses the long-term direction of computing and software development. This talk explains why actors are so vital to the future of software development, and why actors are so exceptionally well suited for use with Domain-Driven Design. Find out how actors speak the Ubiquitous Language of your core business domain and help you reactively scale your systems to today''s and tomorrow''s concurrency demands. Also join my 3-hour hands-on workshop for implementation guidance on the same subject.'
