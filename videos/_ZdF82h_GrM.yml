description: "RubyConf 2017: Buuuuugs iiiiin Spaaaaace! by Colin Fulton\n\nSpace is really cool. From precision electronics, to giant rockets, spacecraft can represent the best of engineering. But sometimes things go wrong. Terribly wrong.\n\nWhat do exploding Soviet rockets have to do with Agile development?\nHow did LISP and Forth hacking save part of the Galileo probe?\nWhat about that time astronauts added life-saving monkey patches... while orbiting the moon!\nExactly how much damage can a little dead code do? (Hint: a lot!)\nThis talk is for anyone whose love of a good space story is rivaled only by their passion for incredibly resilient software."
