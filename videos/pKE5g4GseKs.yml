description: "Ruth Grace Wong and Rodrigo Menezes, Pinterest\n\nJust like many other mid-sized companies, Pinterest runs tens of thousands of machines and hundreds of microservices. This talk describes why and how our engineers migrated our services to Docker, plus stories of how certain elements of the migration were more complicated than expected and caused outages.\n\nWe will go through the containerization plan and architecture at Pinterest, and how we used it to make things easier for developers. We also go into issues we had with performance: networking, java versions, operating system default packages.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
