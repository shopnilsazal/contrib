description: "Pry is the featureful development console for Ruby. From its humble roots as an irb replacement, Pry has grown into an indispensable tool for any Ruby or Rails programmer.\nUsing some real-life examples, I'll explain how to use Pry effectively.\nWe'll start from the beginning, with simple features for exploring libraries and source-code in glorious technicolor. Then we'll move up a level and discuss how to inspect, debug and even modify a program while it is still running. Finally we'll touch on some of Pry's more advanced plugins that can really help you get a feel for what your code is doing.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGad/"
