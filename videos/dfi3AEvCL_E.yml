STUDENT, EURECOM \nTraditionally, network operators have provided some kind of public read-only access to their current view of the BGP routing table, by the means of a \"looking glass‚Äù.\n\nIn this talk we inspect looking glass instances from a security point of view, showing many shortcomings and flaws which could let a malicious entity take control of critical devices connected to them.\n\nIn particular, we will highlight how easy it is for a low-skilled attacker to gain access to core routers within multiple ISP infrastructures.\n\nLuca is currently a research engineer at Eurecom in Sophia-Antipolis (FR). He graduated as a Systems and Networks Engineer at Telecom Paristech and Politecnico di Torino, and is a Debian Developer and an active FLOSS evangelist. Luca's research area includes security of embedded devices, Internet core infrastructure and mobile networks (GSM/LTE).\n\nTwitter: @lucabruno\n\nMariano is currently a Ph.D. student in the Software and Systems Security group of Eurecom in Sophia-Antipolis (France).
