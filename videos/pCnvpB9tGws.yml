description: "RubyConf 2016 - You graduated from bootcamp, now what? by Melanie Gilman\n\nThroughout bootcamp, your biggest worry was finding a job. Now that you’ve found one and you’ve started your career as a developer, what comes next? In this talk, we’ll explore what the career of a bootcamp graduate looks like a few years after the program. We’ll talk about the good and not-so-good parts of being a newly-minted developer. We’ll come away with actionable steps we can take to continue to grow as developers post-bootcamp and be happy and successful, even when we don’t have the mythical perfect job."
