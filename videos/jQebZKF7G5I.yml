title: '#droidconDE 2015: Xavier Hallade â€“ Power optimization for Android'
recordingDate: 1433603785
description: "Find more information here: http://15.droidcon.de/session/power-optimization-android\n\nAndroid devices running on battery need to be optimized for power. If just take a look on the CPU this optimization starts typically with the race to idle, meaning to go to finish the workload as fast as possible. However typical Android devices are running on a SoC with many parts included like CPU, GPU or Audio and Video decoder. All the parts need to be optimized to reduce the power consumption. The Android API provides a number of APIs to help with this and also a power profiling tool can help the developer to understand what hardware parts are active and where he needs to start optimization. \n\nIn the session we will discuss typical causes of high power consumption, how to debug them and provide possible solutions."
