description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nChallenges to Writing Cloud Native Applications - Vallery Lancey, Checkfront (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nCloud native means designing software explicitly for the cloud, not trying to deploy to the cloud in retrospect - shoving a single replica of a monolith into Kubernetes won&rsquo;t cut it. Developing for cloud platforms has many requirements for tooling and behavior of the target cloud platform(s) - for example, maintaining Dockerfiles. There are also many challenges to designing a distributed system that can maintain high consistency, reliability, and availability. We&rsquo;ll explain high level solutions and get into concrete code examples. Key topics are: - Bringing ops requirements into development - Designing for accurate testing - Caching and short term data - Long term storage - Service composition This talk will give developers a foundational understanding of cloud architecture patterns, data management, and requirements building, to empower attendees to hit the ground running.\n\nAbout Vallery\nVallery Lancey is a DevOps Engineer (whatever that means) at Checkfront. She can be found at @vllry on Twitter."
