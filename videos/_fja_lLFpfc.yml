description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nSIG Scheduling Deep Dive – Bobby Salamat & Jonathan Basseri, Google (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nPlease join us for in-depth understanding of Kubernetes Scheduler and its advanced features.In this presentation we talk about the internals of Kubernetes Scheduler and how it keeps track of the cluster resources in order to make scheduling decisions. We will cover the scheduling workflow and the life of a Pod during a scheduling cycle. Then we will talk about some of the advanced scheduling features that enable users to customize placement of their workloads in Kubernetes clusters to achieve higher reliability and/or better resource utilization.This session is most useful for cluster admins or those who want to start contributing to Kubernetes scheduler.\n\nAbout Bobby\nBobby Salamat is co-lead of Kubernetes SIG Scheduling and co-maintainer of Kubernetes default scheduler. He is interested in advanced scheduling techniques to improve resource efficiency of clusters. He is also interested in improving user experience and making default behavior of clusters more intuitive. Before joining Kubernetes, he developed Borg master core at Google.\n\nAbout Jonathan\nHe is a software engineer at Google."
