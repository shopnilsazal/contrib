This presentation will cover a recent penetration test where I came up with a unique avenue to getting over 13,000 shells in just a few minutes by popping one server. I'll be releasing some custom tools to make this simplistic and automate the majority of what was used on this attack. Let's pop a box.\n\nFull Bios available here: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-speakers.html#Kennedy"
