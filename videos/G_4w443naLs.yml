description: "ReproNow: Save time Reproducing and Triaging Security bugs\n\nCrowdsourcing security aka Bug Bounty Programs are adapted by almost all companies today: big, small, mid size. While companies reap a lot of benefits, the challenge is to have a security engineer/engineers reproduce each of the bug, understand the replication method and spend time recreating the security bug that the researcher reported. And sometimes (read all the time) it may also require a lot of going back and forth with the researcher to reproduce the vulnerability. As security engineers we felt the pain as well and we created a tool that solves this challenge and helps organization focus their resources on resolving these vulnerabilities and strengthening their security posture.\n\nOur tool is an open source software and an easy to install chrome/firefox extension. A researcher can install this extension on their browser and record the entire walkthrough of the vulnerability. Our tool captures not only the screen but even Network requests. So, a researcher can capture the entire session and submit this video to the organization. Then the security engineers who validate this can play the video on the tool and see the exploit in action. This makes triaging much easier, saving engineers valuable time. We will be releasing this tool to the community.\n\nSpeakers\n\nVinayendra Nataraja\nSenior Product Security Engineer, Salesforce\nVinayendra Nataraja is a Senior Product Security Engineer at Salesforce and an independent security researcher.
