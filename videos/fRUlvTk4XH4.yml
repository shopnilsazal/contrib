title: '#HITB2012KUL D2T1 - Ollie Whitehouse - Finding the Weak Link in Binaries'
recordingDate: 1354372666
description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS:\nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/materials/ \n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\n\nWith ever increasing OS, compiler and linker defences it is in the interest of researchers and security teams to understand which binaries don't leverage these available protections. The goal maybe to ensure exploitability should a vulnerability be discovered or it may be understanding where other defensive measures need to be deployed.\n\nThis talk will provide a comprehensive review of the available defences and how their presence can be detected without access to source code. The talk will look across a range of binary formats, operating systems and compilers. The talk will also summarize the what, why and how in relation to modern defensive mechanisms while showing how to build the tools to detect.\n\nABOUT OLLIE WHITEHOUSE\n\nOllie is an Associate Director with NCC Group, Europe's largest pure play security services firm. Until December 2011 Ollie was Manager for Security Research & Assessment at RIM (BlackBerry) in EMEA for four years. Ollie has over the past twelve or so years worked for Recx, RIM, Symantec and @stake in a variety of technical consultancy and research roles. He has worked with variety of different platforms and technologies from Windows through to cellular base-band implementations and bootROMs."
