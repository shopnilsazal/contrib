title: 'EmberConf 2014 No more `grunt watch`: Modern build workflows with Broccoli'
recordingDate: 1397386749
description: "Broccoli is the newest JavaScript-based build tool everyone's talking about. It helps you concatenate your scripts, compile your Sass files, and package up your ES6 modulesâ€”all while offering a concise declarative syntax, and blazing fast rebuilds.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, ember-cli is a project to bring an opinionated, Broccoli-based build stack to Ember developers, tuned with their specific needs in mind.\n\nLearn how to use Broccoli and ember-cli to define modern build workflows for your Ember applications, harnessing preprocessors such as Sass and CoffeeScript without losing sub-second rebuild times.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG2y/"
