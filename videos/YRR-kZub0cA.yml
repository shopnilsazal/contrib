We will also describe and demo the ways you can use Seccomp, Apparmor, SELinux and cgroups to make your application containers as secure as possible.\n\nAbout Jess Frazelle\nJess Frazelle is a Software Engineer at Google. She has been a maintainer of Docker, contributor to RunC, Kubernetes and Golang as well as other projects. She loves all things involving Linux namespaces and cgroups and is probably most well known for running desktop applications in containers. She maintained the AppArmor, Seccomp, and SELinux bits in Docker and is quite familiar with locking down containers.\n\nAbout Alex Mohr\nAlex is currently the Technical Lead and Manager of Google Seattle's Kubernetes and Container Engine teams. Previously, he was Engineering Lead for Google Compute Engine's initial public launch, and also lead the design and launch of its VM instance manager subsystem."
