description: "Have you ever peeked over the fence into functional programming land and gazed into a seemingly alien landscape of weird symbols and crazily named concepts? Has your curiosity about functional programming been stymied by complicated words and abstractions? If so, this talk is for you.\n\nWe’re going to take a practical, example-based journey through complex-sounding but deceptively simple functional patterns such as functors, applicatives and the big bad monad. We’ll see how these patterns work, what they’re for and how they are used to make clean, composable code. We’ll also identify the places where functional patterns are quietly being used in our mainstream day to day languages. By the end of the talk, you will be better equipped to take further steps down the functional programming path of enlightenment."
