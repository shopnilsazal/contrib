recordingDate: 1442521845
description: "Stand-Up Comedy that Doesn't Hurt\n\nSumana Harihareswara performs stand-up comedy that assumes you're smart. You'll laugh about the absurdities of capitalism, everyday microaggressions, and HOW DO I PEOPLE. If you've shied away from mainstream comedy because it's so often marginalizing and oppressive, you'll enjoy these observations about:\n* why refusing to use Facebook is like being a vegan\n* public transit and social disasters\n* going through airport security while brown\n* the peculiar hazards of consulting in open source, from LibreOffice templates to Richard Stallman\n* and more.\n\nLink for the apology:\nhttp://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2015/06/27/0\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HGbM/"
