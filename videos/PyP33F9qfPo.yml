title: 'RubyConf 2010 - Programming and minimalism: lessons from Orwell and the Clash by: Jonathan Dahl'
recordingDate: 1428420686
description: 'Programming is writing. A programmer''s job is to express abstract ideas in a specific language - just like the poet, the essayist, and the composer. But while writers and composers spend years improving their style, many programmers think style stops with "two-space indentation". This needs to change. This session will discuss style in music, writing, and software. We''ll look at such diverse sources as George Orwell, Mozart, and punk music, and will find that much of art revolves around complexity and minimalism - just like software. Finally, we''ll look at specific patterns and tools for writing software that is effective, efficient, and beautiful.'
