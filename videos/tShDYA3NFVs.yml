description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nSeptember 16, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe ability to recognize and work with different emotions is fundamental to psychological flexibility and well-being. Neuroscience has contributed to the understanding of the neural bases of emotion, emotion regulation, and emotional intelligence, and has begun to elucidate the brain mechanisms involved in emotion processing. Of great interest is the degree to which these mechanisms demonstrate neuroplasticity in both anatomical and functional levels of the brain.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Dr. Phillippe Goldin"
