title: 'Iteratively Develop Microservices with Speed on Kubernetes  : Build 2018'
language: English
recordingDate: 1525909048
description: "Microservices is an architectural style that can bring many benefits when building cloud-scale apps. But working with microservices can be painful. Developers working on one or two microservices in an app that has 10s find it difficult to reproduce the entire application locally to test their changes. In a team that's working in parallel on different parts of an application, developers often find surprises when they integrate their changes. This session will show you how to rapidly iterate and debug code directly in Kubernetes. You get to use familiar dev tools like Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio with the programming language of your choice, but you are always working on Kubernetes in the cloud, in the context of your team and overall application.\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree"
