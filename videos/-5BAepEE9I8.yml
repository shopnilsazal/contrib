description: "PyData New York City 2017\n\nSlides: https://github.com/yinleon/pydata2017/blob/master/pydata-yin-reverse_img_search.ipynb\n\nWe propose a simple, robust, and scalable reverse image search engine that leverages convolutional features from Keras' pre-trained neural networks and the distance metric from Scikit-Learn's K-Nearest Neighbors. We show example queries using data scraped from Google images, and dive deeper in how we use the search engine to track the proliferation of memes from the dark web."
