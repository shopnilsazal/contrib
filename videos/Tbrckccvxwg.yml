description: "Demo of Kubernetes on Windows Server - Michael Michael, Apprenda\n\nWindows Server, and .NET, currently host 30-50% of enterprise workloads in the Global 2000. For Kubernetes to provide a single distributed application fabric to all enterprise workloads, it must have full integration with Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server containers. In KubeCon London 2016 Apprenda announced that it would lead this development effort and teamed up with Red Hat to extend Kubernetes to the Microsoft ecosystem. In this session we will demo Kubernetes on Windows Server 2016 and discuss its features. \n\nAbout Michael Michael\nMichael Michael (or M2 as he's known) is Apprenda's Senior Director of Product Management.
