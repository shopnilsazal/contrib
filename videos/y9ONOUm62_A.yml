description: "http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/tomasz-baranski\n\nRust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed and concurrency. At the first glance Rust doesn't seem like a functional language. However, closer look reveals features like type inference, immutable data, traits that look a lot like type classes, algebraic data types, pattern matching.\n\nDuring this presentation you will learn functional features of Rust and see some examples of how well-known functional patterns can be implemented in it. Prior knowledge of Rust is not required."
