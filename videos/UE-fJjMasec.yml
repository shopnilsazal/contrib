description: "The emoji that Killed Chrome!! by Julian Squires\n\nOne day, I came back from lunch to discover everyone’s copy of Chrome wouldn’t stop crashing!! How could turning on a printer downstairs cause an office-wide browser outage!?! A glorious part of programming is when a bug reveals the delicate fragility of a system far beyond its scope! Tracing down the culprit will take us on a journey through Unicode, mDNS, gdb, tcpdump, tcpreplay, and Objective-C!!\n\nJulian is an eccentric layabout in Montreal, Canada. He gets paid to slowly program computers fastly."
