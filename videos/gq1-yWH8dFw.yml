description: "Luke Spademan | Thursday 12:30 | Room C\n\nI am 15 year old that came to pyconuk last year and gave a lightening talk on how I made a micro:bit calculator that could then communicate with other micro:bits.\n\nI have since broadened by learning to create the connect 4 game that I hinted at creating, and then combined it with google's neural net framework (tensorflow) and a raspberry pi to add an AI opponent.\n\nI will be showing you what I learnt from developing my ideas, and how I overcame any issues I faced."
