description: "In episode 2 of the MVP Show we join MVP, Dominick Baier, in his hometown of Heidelberg, Germany. He has been a tremendous contributor to the technical community and an MVP for 10+ years, focusing on Visual Studio and development technologies. Together we discuss some of his passions, including identity and access control protocols. In this video\_we also have fun exploring the local highlights from a native point of view. We hope watching this is as fun for you, as we had making it. Any questions or comments? Please don't hesitate to drop us a line below! Who knows, maybe you will be invited to an upcoming video shoot with Seth next!\n\nDominick's blog:\_https://leastprivilege.com/\nBrock's blog:\_https://brockallen.com/\nIdentityServer website:\_https://identityserver.io\nTraining dates:\_https://identityserver.io/training\nDocumentation:\_https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io\nTutorials:\_https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/release/quickstarts/0_overview.html"
