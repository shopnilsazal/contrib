description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2016 in Washington, DC\nhttps://2016.appsecusa.org/\n\nPractical Static Analysis for Continuous Application Security\n\n\nStatic code analysis tools that attempt determine what code does without actually running the code provide an excellent opportunity to perform lightweight security checks as part of the software development lifecycle. Unfortunately, building generic static analysis tools, especially for security, is a costly, time-consuming effort. As a result very few tools exist and commercial tools are very expensive - if they even support your programming language.\n\nThe good news is building targeted static analysis tools for your own environment with rules specific to your needs is much easier! Since static analysis tools can be run at any point in the software development lifecycle, even simple tools enable powerful security assurance when added to continuous integration. This talk will go through straight-forward options for static analysis, from grep to writing rules for existing tools through writing static analysis tools from scratch.\n\nSpeakers\n\nJustin Collins\nCEO, Brakeman Security, Inc\nJustin has been an application security engineer at SurveyMonkey, Twitter, and AT&T Interactive, and is the primary author of Brakeman, an open source static analysis security tool for Ruby on Rails.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
