description: "Lukas Grunwald, RF-ID and Smart-Labes: Myth, Technology and Attacks\nThis talk provides an overview of the RF-ID Smart-Labes, small labels on products with an embedded microchip and an antenna. Smart-Labes store product and serial-number, expiration date etc. and can be read from a distance.\n\nThe Industry is planning to put these labels with an international product code on every product within the next decade, effectively replacing the old bar-code system. Some stores already use Smart-Labes, for example certain pharmacies in the US, and in Europe the Metro Group in their Future Store.\n\nAt the end of this talk there is a practical demonstration of RF-DUMP, my tool to read and write Smart-Labes, check their meta-data and manipulate it.\n\nMr. Lukas Grunwald is CTO of DN-Systems Enterprise Internet Solutions GmbH (Hildesheim/Germany) a globally acting consulting office working mainly in the field of security and internet/eCommerce solutions for enterprises.
