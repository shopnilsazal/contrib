description: "\"Customer Service for Sysadmins\", by H. Wade Minter, TeamSnap Inc.\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this video are those of the speaker(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the USENIX Association.**\r\n\r\nEverybody knows the stereotype of BOFHs, hiding behind the glow of their monitors, disregarding all human interaction that doesn't arrive via IRC. Some of us may even resemble that stereotype to a degree. But whether your customers are internal developers or external users, your personal and company success depends in large part on their perceptions, especially in this era of social media and worldwide feedback. A veteran sysadmin will talk about how his startup, TeamSnap, has built a passionate and devoted following by using simple, inexpensive tools and techniques for listening and responding to customers."
