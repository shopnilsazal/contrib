title: 'DEF CON 18 - Panel - Meet the Feds - Policy, Privacy, Deterrence and Cyber War'
recordingDate: 1383783118
description: "Panel - Meet the Feds - Policy, Privacy, Deterrence and Cyber War\nThis panel of federal agents will discuss cyber policy. How do we conduct robust continuous monitoring across a large multi-organizational enterprise yet stay within the constitutional requirements for privacy, civil rights and civil liberties? What changes are needed in the criminal justice system to increase the deterrence of committing cyber-crime? Once a cyber-crime has occurred - and through investigative efforts is determined to be a nation state - who becomes in charge or better yet who determines if it rises to the level of cyber-war versus espionage?\n\nMike Convertino AF\nJerry Dixon Ex-DHS\nAndy Fried Ex-IRS\nJon Iadonisi Ex-Navy Seal\nKevin Manson Ex-FLETC\nRich Marshall DHS\nMarcus Sachs Ex-DoD, Ex-DHS, Ex-NSC\nRoberta Stempfley DHS\nRandy Vickers US CERT\nLin Wells NDU\nAmit Yoran Ex-DHS\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
