description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18)\n\nSeamless Development Environments on Kubernetes using Telepresence - Ara Pulido, Bitnami (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nWhen developing API extensions or services that deeply integrate with Kubernetes, you may find yourself juggling kubeconfig contexts or iterating through a slow build-push-deploy cycle. Telepresence allows you to develop services locally as if they were running in your cluster. It does this by proxying pods to your local machine and gives your local services seamless access to service discovery and volumes. With Telepresence, you no longer have to maintain Docker Compose files for local orchestration, and you can take full advantage of Kubernetes features such as Ingress, Secrets/ConfigMaps, RBAC and more. In this demo-led session, we&rsquo;ll take a look at how Telepresence works, the different ways you can use it and how it makes iteratively developing on Kubernetes a breeze.\n\nAbout Ara\nAra Pulido is an engineering manager with more than 10 years of experience working on open source companies. She manages the Kubernetes and SRE teams at Bitnami. She is a Certified Kubernetes Administrator."
