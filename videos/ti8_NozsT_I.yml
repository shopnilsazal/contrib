title: 'DEF CON 23 - Ian Kline - LTE Recon and Tracking with RTLSDR'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450307216
description: "Since RTLSDR became a consumer grade RX device, numerous talks and open source tools enabled the community to monitor airplanes, ships, and cars... but come on, what we really want to track are cell phones. If you know how to run cmake and have $50 to pick up an RTLSDR-E4000, I'll make sure you walk out of here with the power to monitor LTE devices around you on a slick Kibana4 dashboard. You'll also get a primer on geolocating the devices if you've got a second E4000 and some basic soldering skills.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nIan has 10 years of experience studying the global RF emissions environment. Professionally, he uses this knowledge to rapidly hack up communication platforms and conduct RF surveys for pentesting and red teaming activities. Personnally, he can be found listening to satellites and building databses of all the cars that park on his block with TPMS. He currently supports Wolf Den Associates as Red Team leader and Digital Signature Specialist."
