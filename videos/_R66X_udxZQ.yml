title: 'Timothy Hopper: Understanding Probabilistic Topic Models By Simulation'
recordingDate: 1449251039
description: "PyData NYC 2015\n\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation and related topic models are often presented in the form of complicated equations and confusing diagrams. I will present LDA as a generative model through probabilistic simulation in simple Python. Simulation will help data scientists to understand the model assumptions and limitations and more effectively use black box LDA implementations.\n\nThose without training in probabilistic graphical models and measure theory, data scientist may have a hard time understanding Latent Dirichlet Allocation and other probabilistic topic models. However, because LDA is a generative model, we can write Python code to generated data based on the model assumptions.\n\nThe talk will progress as follows:\n\nIntroduction to mixture models\nSimulation of mixture models\nIntroduction to grouped data\nSimulation of latent Dirichlet allocation\nFitting and visualizing LDA with Python\n\nSlides available here:  https://github.com/tdhopper/pydata-nyc-2015"
