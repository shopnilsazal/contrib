description: "PyData London 2018\n\nIn this talk we will show how we improved our CV parsing performance by training RNN models using Tensorflow. We will demonstrate how to set up and train a BLSTM sequence labeling model and discuss extensions such as learning line representations, combining RNN and CRF layers and training multilingual models.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/cvanweelden/sequence_labeling_example\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
