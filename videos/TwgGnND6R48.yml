description: "Presented By: Nicholas Tollervey & Simon Davy\n\nWe will describe and (maybe) perform via the medium of Brass Band footfall data collected from the city of Leeds.\n\nIt's likely to be a loud, fun, interesting and musical exposition of big data manipulated with Python.\n\nIt may involve Tubas."
