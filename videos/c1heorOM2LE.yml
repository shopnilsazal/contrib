title: 'Pacific Northwest Scala 2013 Akka in Production: Our Story by Evan Chan'
recordingDate: 1382888607
description: "Everyone in the Scala world is using or looking into using Akka for low-latency, scalable, distributed or concurrent systems. We want to share our story of developing and productionizing multiple Akka apps, including low-latency ingestion and real-time processing systems, and Spark-based applications.\n\nWhen does one use actors vs futures?\nWhy did we go with Logback instead of Akka's built-in logging?\nCan we use Akka with, or in place of, Storm?\nHow did we set up instrumentation and monitoring in production?\nHow does one use VisualVM to debug Akka apps in production?\nWhat happens if the mailbox gets full?\nWhat is our Akka stack like?\nWe will share best practices that we've discovered when building Akka and Scala apps, pitfalls and things we'd like to avoid, and a vision of where we would like to go for ideal Akka monitoring, instrumentation, and debugging facilities.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG6p/"
