description: "Google Tech Talks\nSeptember, 21 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nBrain and computer were wed mid-twentieth century by the McCulloch-Pitts model neuron and Hodgkin-Huxley equations for digital firing in biological neurons. Since then, brain neurons, synapses, firings and networks have been considered analogous to electronic switches, states and circuits in classical computers. But despite extraordinary advances and bold predictions, consciousness seems ever\nmore elusive. On this, and other divisive issues like EEG gamma synchrony, deviations from Hodgkin-Huxley, gap junctions, dendritic\nwebs/hyper-neurons, anesthesia, quantum computers and clear demonstration of functional quantum coherence in warm protein..."
