title: 'Kubernetes Operators: Managing Complex Software with Software [I] - Josh Wood & Jesus Carrillo'
recordingDate: 1491874346
description: "Kubernetes Operators: Managing Complex Software with Software [I] - Josh Wood, CoreOS & Jesus Carrillo, Ticketmaster\n\n\nThe Kubernetes container orchestrator scales and connects stateless applications quite easily. Stateful applications can require more work. Databases, caching systems, and file stores are harder to dynamically manage with data intact, and sometimes come with their own notion of clustering. Operators automate these tasks. Operators are Kubernetes agents that know how to deploy, scale, manage, and even upgrade complex applications.\n\nIn this talk, we'll illustrate the Operator concept, showing how Operators are built atop the Kubernetes third-party resources mechanism, with a close examination of the open source etcd Operator. We'll demonstrate Operators in action, including the extension of the Operator concept to upgrading Kubernetes control plane components themselves. The audience will learn how to deploy Operators, and how to begin developing Operators to manage their own stateful applications.\n\nAbout Jesus Carrillo\nJesus Carrillo is a Senior Systems Engineer at Ticketmaster. He previously worked at AWS and Oracle and is passionate about new technologies and the best way to adopt them. When Jesus is not working he likes to relax and enjoy life.\n\nAbout Joshua Wood\nJosh Woodâ€™s early adoption of the rkt container runtime led him to CoreOS, where he is responsible for documentation. Josh has worked in a variety of roles in innovative startups throughout his career, holding diverse titles from systems admin to product director and CTO. He is passionate about constructing the future of utility computing with open source technologies like Kubernetes and rkt."
