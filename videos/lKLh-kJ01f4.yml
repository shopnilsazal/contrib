description: "Anthony Lai, Jake Appelbaum & Jon Oberheide - The Power of Chinese Security\nIf you visit China, I am sure you would like the Great Wall, however, if you surf the Internet in China, I am sure you hate the Great FireWall (GFW). How a firewall could \"serve\" over 3.8 billion Internet users in China is a readily interesting story for the globe.\n\nIn the presentation and seminar, we will quote case studies and discussions from various forums in China about how Internet censorship impacts them. In addition, we will present technical aspects and diagnosis on how censorship could be achieved on the Internet, content filtering software and instant messenger. Moreover, some tools/software (China or non-China made) used to bypass Internet and content censorship.\n\nThis presentation is suitable to those would like to do business/tours in China.\n\nIn Anthony's technical and work experience, he enjoys reverse engineering, exploitation, malware analysis and penetration testing. He began his DEFCON experience in 2007, and to be frank, people claim he is crazy! Anthony started an organized research group on reverse engineering , malware analysis and forensics in Hong Kong (people there love money instead of hardcore hacking techniques). Anthony is quite concerned about the impact of Internet censorship on our Chinese fellows in China, and he believes as he comes from Hong Kong, it would be \"advantageous\" for him to discuss it openly. He has presented reverse engineering dissection over Green Dam, which is a content filtering software in Hong Kong, and is widely reported by International and Chinese media.\n\nSince the hacker community always supports freedom of information flow, which matches the spirit and philosophy of this presentation, it is fun for him to partner and present with two another researchers to make the presentation fruitful and internationalized.\n\nJake Appelbaum (aka ioerror) is an accomplished photographer, software hacker and world traveler. He works as a developer for The Tor Project and trains interested parties globally on how to effectively use and contribute to the Tor network. He is a founding member of the hacklab Noisebridge in San Francisco where he indulges his interests in magnetics, cryptography and consensus based governance. He was a driving force in the team behind the creation of the Cold Boot Attacks; winning both the Pwnie for Most Innovative Research award and the Usenix Security best student paper award in 2008. Additionally, he was part of the MD5 Collisions Inc. team that created a rogue CA certificate by using a cluster of 200 PS3s funded by the Swiss taxpayers. He is also an ethics enthusiast, a former pornographer and proud Vegan.\n\nJon Oberheide is currently at Scio Security, a security startup founded by Dug Song and himself. He is also wrapping up his PhD thesis at the University of Michigan, where he previously received a BS and MS in Computer Science. Jon has a passion for all things related to security, whether physical, code, or network. In his free time, he picks locks, audits code, analyzes protocols, writes exploits, and patches holes. He believes in monkeys.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 18 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-18-archive.html"
