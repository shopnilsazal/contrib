description: "Differential Privacy and Machine Learning:\nIn this talk, we will give a friendly introduction to Differential Privacy, a rigorous methodology for analyzing data subject to provable privacy guarantees, that has recently been widely deployed in several settings. The talk will specifically focus on the relationship between differential privacy and machine learning, which is surprisingly rich. This includes both the ability to do machine learning subject to differential privacy, and tools arising from differential privacy that can be used to make learning more reliable and robust (even when privacy is not a concern)."
