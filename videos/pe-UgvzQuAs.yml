description: "\"Community teaching practices\n[EuroPython 2017 - Panel - 2017-07-13 - PyCharm Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nIn the last five years we saw many groups dedicated to teach people how to program but any volunteer that is going to start a new teaching group could have hundreds of questions related with concepts order, examples, exercises, libraries and text editor/IDE. Panellists will share their experience when teaching Python to newcomers from different backgrounds as part of their volunteer work for some organisations such as PyLadies, DjangoGirls, Code for Life, Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, etc. Among the panellists we will have\n\n\nMateusz Kuzak, from the Netherlands eScience Center and volunteer for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry;\nAlice Harpole, from the University of Southampton;\nCeline Boudier, from Code for Life;\nRaniere Silva (as moderator), from the Software Sustainability Institute.\n\nAll questions from the audience are welcomed.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
