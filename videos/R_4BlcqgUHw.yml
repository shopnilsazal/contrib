This presentation will provide an introduction to the new Apache Unomi project, currently in incubation. Unomi is a reference implementation of the OASIS ConteXt Server specification aimed at standardizing personalization technologies while addressing privacy issues at the same time. He will simulate a live shopping experience using an iOS device, iBeacons and even an Apple TV to illustrate how Unomi can integrate in real time a wide-variety of devices, ranging from IoT to large web-based applications.'
