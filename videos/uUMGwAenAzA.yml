recordingDate: 1392701383
description: "Sean O'Toole, Mutating the Mutators\nSince the introduction of metamorphic stealth in the computer virus world, it has been suggested that the method can also be used to protect any, even legitimate, code. The only downfall of this technique is that how the engine manipulates the code remains constant. This allows the original code to be obtained by using an optimizer. The next step for this stealth method is to create an engine that will change how the code in manipulated. This speech will outline how to create an engine that integrates random code with alternate encoding of an instruction to create a semi-random set of instructions, which will fit into the metamorphic engine paradigm.\n\nSean O'Toole is fresh out of college for Computer Science and Mathematics. He has been playing around with viruses since high school and had also taken independent studies on computer viruses in college. As well as the above, he also helped institutions such as NCAR use Artificial Life Algorithms for modeling."
