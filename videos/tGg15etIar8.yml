description: "DevOpsDays Chicago 2017 - Ignites- Title: Management or Technical? by Michael Stahnke\n\nHave you ever been pressed in your career about whether you want to go into management or be technical? I get asked this a lot. My answer is always, “why do I have to choose?” I’ll like to dive into the root of this question and then cover ways in which you can be a leader and still be a technical contributor. It’s a challenge, but certainly possible. I’ll draw on my experience over the last five years at Puppet, Inc.\n\nItems Covered:\n\nWhat is technical work anyway?\nPrioritization is most important\nCheck your title when doing technical work\nDon’t put yourself on critical path\nDon’t fall into micromanagement designs\nHow are you improving those around you?"
