description: "by Starr Horne\nMany people assume that the only way to add interesting charts and visualizations to their web applications is via JavaScript. But this isn’t true. You don’t need a 900 kB JavaScript library to generate simple charts. Instead you can use SVG and Ruby.\nOnce you learn how to build your own SVG graphics then it’s possible to do cool things like cache them, or use your own CSS and JavaScript to manipulate them. This presentation will show you how.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GWI5/"
