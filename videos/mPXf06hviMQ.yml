recordingDate: 1506011104
description: "Chief Researcher for Tresata and Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science at Davidson College Dr. Tim Chartier specializes in sports analytics. He frequently consults on data analytics questions, including projects with ESPN Magazine, ESPN’s Sport Science program, NASCAR teams, the NBA, and fantasy sports sites. In 2014, Tim was named the inaugural Math Ambassador for the Mathematical Association of America, which also recognized Dr. Chartier’s ability to communicate math with a national teaching award. His research and scholarship were recognized with the prestigious Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship. Published by Princeton University Press, Tim authored Math Bytes: Google Bombs, Chocolate-Covered Pi, and Other Cool Bits in Computing. Through the Teaching Company, he taught a 24-lecture series entitled Big Data: How Data Analytics Is Transforming the World. In K-12 education, Tim has also worked with Google and Pixar on their educational initiatives. Dr. Chartier has served as a resource for a variety of media inquiries, including appearances with Bloomberg TV, NPR, the CBS Evening News, USA Today, and The New York Times.\n\n\nBeyond a Bit Fit:\nAn emerging and important avenue of sport analytics is biometric data. From the casual athlete tracking steps and sleep to professional athletes tracking heart rate and impact data, biometric data can improve performance and prevent injury. What can we learn from biometric data? How can it aid athletes and coaches? How can you be a bit fitter by analyzing a body’s data? This talk will discuss the data, analysis and insights available and evolving in sports analytics of biometric data."
