description: "Feats of Daring with the Ruby Standard Libaray by Jen Diamond, Stephanie Betancourt, Omowale Oniyide and Josh Loper\n\nThe Standard Librarians are working to make the Ruby Standard Library more accessible to it's users, beginner through advanced. The basis for it is existing ruby-docs. The Stand Librarians have taken it further with explanations that are easier to parse, libraries grouped into categories, examples to try, links aggregated for further study and similar gems listed. This talk will demonstrate the new site, how it was made it and how RGSoC helped make that happen. Ruby's Standard Libraries have a lot of tricks up it's sleeves.
