description: "Filmed at PyData London 2017\n\nDescription\nDataKind UK share their experiences and critical success factors from 3 years of learning-by-doing in using data in the service of humanity.\n\nAbstract\nMost of us will know data for business as the art and science of using proprietary data to solve high value commercial problems. But how can those same techniques be used to solve societal problems as well? From tackling money laundering through network statistics to establishing the true scale of youth homelessness through Bayesian inference, DataKind UK will share examples of how they’ve partnered with charities to use data for good. Reflecting on what has and hasn’t worked in three years, they will share the critical success factors they’ve identified along the way.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
