description: "Synthesizing Video and Turning it into Music! by Jes Wolfe!\n\nI like finding ways to use technology for things that it wasn’t originally meant to do. In this talk, I’ll take you on a tour of a rabbit hole I followed recently: Using a web browser’s 3D graphics capabilities to generate 2D video, and then converting the data in that video into sound, to produce music.\n\nJes Wolfe! is a computer programmer who, in some contexts, refers to themself as an “artist” and/or “musician”, and is especially interested in the artistic consequences of algorithms. They live in a house in the woods in Portland, Oregon and currently work at GitHub."
