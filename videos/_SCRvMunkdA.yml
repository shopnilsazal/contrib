recordingDate: 1438096666
description: 'Struct tags are a great feature of Go, but in the general Go community they receive almost no attention. In this talk we want to show you some of the cleverest and weirdest uses of struct tags weâ€™ve seen. Specifying json and xml fields in struct tags is commonplace, but have you thought about using tags for object-relational mapping, validation functions, defining middleware, or command line options? Come join us for a tour of our favorite practical and impractical uses of an underutilized part of Go.'
