description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2018 by Xavier F. Gouchet, Workwell.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/#session-37\nSlides link: https://gitpitch.com/xgouchet/Talks/AndroidMakers_RockTheGradle#/\n\nMore often than none, Android build.gradle file grow larger and more complex to adapt to specific build constraints and scenarios which are not supported by default. Custom tasks, advanced usages, â€¦ the use cases are infinite.\n\nGradle offers the possibility to integrate custom plugins directly in your project, without the need to make a separate project and publish the artifact in a maven repository. This presentation will walk you through this concept, with a couple of concrete example of plugins you can write yourself.\n\n Alex Karp Production"
