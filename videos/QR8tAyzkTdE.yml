description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nBuilding a Go AI with Kubernetes and TensorFlow - Andrew Jackson & Josh Hoak, Google (Beginner Skill Level)\n\nReinforcement learning approaches can be massively parallelized, so Kubernetes seems like a natural fit, as Kubernetes is all about reducing the overhead for managing applications. However, it can be daunting to wade into Kubernetes and Machine Learning, especially when you add in hardware accelerators like GPUs or TPUs! This talk will break down how you can use Kubernetes and TensorFlow to create, in relatively few lines of code, a tabula rasa AI that can play the game of go, inspired by the AlphaZero algorithm published by Deepmind. This talk will rely on GPUs, TPUs, TensorFlow, KubeFlow, and large-scale Kubernetes Engine clusters.\n\nAbout Josh \nJosh has been a software engineer at Google for the last 6 years, most recently working on Google Kubernetes Engine. Josh learned to program a decade ago writing python scripts to generate go books, and has been a go enthusiast ever since.\n\nAbout Andrew\nAndrew Jackson currently works on machine learning at Google, previously working on the Google Clips camera. Outside of Google, Andrew Jackson serves on the board of directors of the American Go Association."
