description: "Scalable Deployments - How we Deploy Rails app to 100+ Hosts in a Minute by Shota Fukumori\n\nIf you're developing webapps, I guess you deploy sometime using tools like Capistrano. We think existing tools slow for huge apps and a lot of servers.\n\nWe serves cookpad.com, which is a huge Rails app, and the largest recipe site in Japan. It's backed 120+ app servers. We've used Capistrano + SSH + rsync, but it became a bottleneck, slower and slower, as well as server increases. Our developer have wanted to focus on development. Deployments should be done in short time.\n\nIn this talk I'll introduce about our new deploy tool Mamiya, and will talk about how we deploy webapp in a minute.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FrUT/"
