description: "BY: CHRIS HENN\n\nEmber's declarative object model and data-binding make it an excellent fit for building data visualizations that respond to change. This talk presents two ways to think about building dynamic SVG visualizations in Ember in the context of Hadley Wickham's The Grammar of Graphics. Along the way various subjects will be discussed, including code reuse and composition with Ember components and D3, imperative vs. declarative style tradeoffs, and tips and tricks for making visualizations easy to build and use.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GO1P/"
