description: "Passive Fingerprinting of HTTP/2 Clients\n\n\nHTTP/2 is the second major version of the HTTP protocol. It changes the way HTTP is transferred “on the wire” by introducing a full binary protocol that is made up of TCP connections, streams, and frames, rather than a plain-text protocol. Such a fundamental change from HTTP/1.x to HTTP/2, means that client-side and server-side implementations have to incorporate completely new code in order to support new HTTP/2 features. This introduces nuances in protocol implementations, which, in return, might be used to passively fingerprint web clients.\n\nOur research is based on more than 10 million HTTP/2 connections from which we extracted fingerprints for over 40,000 unique user agents across hundreds of implementations.\n\nIn the presentation, I intend provide the following:\n\n• HTTP/2 Overview\n\n- Introduction into the basic elements of the protocol\n\n- a review the different components chosen for the fingerprint format (alongside a discussion on those left out)\n\n- Potential use cases of the proposed fingerprint\n\n- Usage Statistics - prevalence of HTTP/2 usage on Akamai’s platform\n\n• Examples of common HTTP/2 Implementations & Client fingerprints collected during the research\n\n• HTTP/2 support (or the lack of) among common web security tools (Burp suite, sqlmap, etc.)\n\n• Review of attacks over HTTP/2 observed on Akamai’s platform\n\n \n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://akamai.me/2qWIqON  - whitepaper published by Akamai’s Threat-Research Team.\n\n\nElad Shuster\nSecurity Data Analyst, Akamai\nCPA(il), MBA, Security Data Analyst at Akamai, with over 10 years of experience in data analysis across different industries.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
