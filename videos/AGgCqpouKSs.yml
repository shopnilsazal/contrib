description: "Description\nWord2vec is a model of multi-dimensional vector representation of words. Similarity in the vector values often accompanies a semantic relation between words. But exploring the vector space further, we can find more interesting and surprising relations. I will shed some light on the mathematical meaning of the word vectors using an interactive visualization.\n\nAbstract\nWord2vec is a model of multi-dimensional vector representation of words. Exploring the relations in vector space one can find that it surprisingly well preserves semantic analogies between words. In the talk I will use my interactive visualization with pre-trained vectors from GloVe to illustrate the examples and relations.\n\nDot product of normalized vectors often indicates whether two words tend to co-occur in similar contexts. That can be used to find synonyms or antonyms. A solution of a semantic riddle like \"X is to Y as A is to...?\" is probably the word vector closest to A + Y - X. Another interesting aspect is vector projection on a word difference axis. It allows us to extract a specific aspect of a vector, such as gender (e. g. projecting names on a he-she axis) or job prestige (e. g. jobs on a rich-poor axis).\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
