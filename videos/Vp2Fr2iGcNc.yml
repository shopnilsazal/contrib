description: "Alena Hall\nhttp://lanyrd.com/2016/netfringe/sfcxqp/\n\"When designing a reliable solution with lots of moving parts, it's important to look not just into code but in-between code - more at the integration parts of the overall system.\n\nIn this intense talk you will learn about the variety of real-world important aspects to take into account architecting a flexible solution.\n\nSome of the valuable aspects are environment choices, infrastructure planning, preparation and automation, separation of solution parts into independently deployable services, service discovery, replication, resiliency and many more.\n\nYou will explore into the practical architecture of Kubernetes and see how to create and configure Kubernetes cluster in the cloud.\n\nYou will see how to create .NET based microservices (e.g. using F#) and deploy it on Kubernetes.\""
