title: 'DEF CON 17 - Muhaimin Dzulfakar - Advanced MySQL Exploitation'
recordingDate: 1384939627
description: "Advanced MySQL Exploitation\nMuhaimin Dzulfakar Security Consultant, security-assessment.com\n\nThis talk focuses on how MySQL SQL injection vulnerabilities can be used to gain remote code execution on the LAMP and WAMP environments. Attackers performing SQL injection on a MySQL platform must deal with several limitations and constraints. For example, the lack of multiple statements in one query makes MySQL an unpopular platform for remote code execution compared to other platforms. This talk will show that arbitrary code execution is possible on the MySQL platform and explain the techniques. In this presentation, the author will release a new tool titled MySqloit. This tool can be integrated with metasploit and is able to upload and execute shellcodes using a SQL Injection vulnerability in LAMP or WAMP environments.\n\nMuhaimin Dzulfakar is a Security Consultant for Security-Assessment.com, located in Wellington, New Zealand. His primary duties include network and application penetration testing. Muhaimin Dzulfakar has a bachelor degree in Software Engineering from Multimedia University, Kuala Lumpur where he developed his own Intrusion Detection System. His research interests include exploit development methods and post exploitation process.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
