title: '#HITB2018AMS KEYNOTE 2 - A Risk Assessment of Logo Disclosures - Jennifer Leggio'
recordingDate: 1524809558
description: "In the culture of security, research is revered and marketing is abhorred. Sadly, the latter reputation is often earned because vendors often compromise security research, or programs developed to ultimately protect users, in an effort to demonstrate their technical talent or increase sales.\n\nDuring this keynote, Jennifer Leggio will address “logo disclosure” and how it creates sensationalism and spectacle; analyze the difference between authentic bug bounty programs versus those that “virtue signal” through marketing; and, while there is good debate about evolving Coordinated Disclosure, the risk created by companies that violate disclosure to try to diminish competitors, sell more wares, or unethically highlight research prowess. This risk that is created by overly aggressive marketers can outweigh the merits of truly great research.\n\n=== \n\nJennifer Leggio is the Chief Marketing Officer for Flashpoint, where she is responsible for propelling the company’s market leadership and customer acquisition. Jennifer has an almost 20-year history of building compelling positioning, thought leadership, and go-to-market strategies to help shape the security industry. She is also fiercely protective of security research. Jennifer has held senior leadership roles at Cisco, Sourcefire, and Fortinet, and started her tech career at a public relations agency where she took several security startups from stealth to market. She’s been a marketing writer for Forbes and ZDNet, and is now a contributing writer for ZDNet “Zero Day”. She can be reached on Twitter @mediaphyter."
