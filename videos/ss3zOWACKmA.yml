description: "LoRaWAN for exploring the Internet of Things  Talk Hard: A technical, political, and cultural look at LoRaWAN for IoT\nby Benedict Gaster (cuberoo_)\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nEveryone is excited about the The Internet of Things (IoT) and thepossibilities of really seeing the democratization of the internet, devicesfor everyone needs, not just a few! If we are to achieve, then these devicesmust be design and built by everyone, we must create a Zine like industry,beyond the current makers of today, to enable people of all ages, gender(including non-binary), and race, to build devices suited to their own needs.LoRaWAN is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) specification intended forwireless battery operated Things in regional, national or global networks.LoRaWAN target key requirements of Internet of Things such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility and localization services.\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce LoRaWAN as a key radio technology for IoT andwalk through why it is a technologically important development as I show howto build LoRaWAN node applications to explore the possibility of IoT. Thereare a number of LoRaWAN networks emerging across Europe and I will highlightthe political importance of why these networks should be open, supporting OpenData and Open Science and empowering the development of a new set applicationdomains.\n\nThe lecture will involve a demonstration of an LoRaWAN application that willshowcase the both the node and Gateway aspects of a deployed network.\n\nSoon, everything on Earth will be connected via peer-to-peer networking and/orthe public Internet, with a multitude of sensor-driven devices dramaticallychanging our lives and our environment. These devices will be based on a widevariety of devices, ranging from tiny (e.g., microcontrollers) to huge (e.g.,cloud servers), with one thing in common: they will require a radio connectionto a Gateway that is connected to the internet, in some form or another. WhileBluetooth LE or even Wi-fi might be used around the \"smart\" house or within alimited range, the battery limitations of the later and the range limitationsof the former mean it is unlikely that these standards will form the backboneof a IoT network.\n\nFor IoT there are a number of competing radio standards, e.g. LoRa and SigFox,both are long range and provide the ability to build nodes that are very low-power, with a potential battery life of 2 or more years, while providing along range, often in access of 10km. A key feature of these standards is theyare low-bandwidth, often each message is limited to 100 or so bytes, forSigFox even less. Each standard has its drawbacks but SigFox requires moreexpensive chipsets for the Gateway side of things, which is not the case forLoRa, and as such this has seen the development of community, crowd sourced,LoRa networks, based on LoRaWAN. One example of this is The Things Network,who community has been developing Gateways, nodes, cloud backends, andsoftware to run on these, all open source, supporting open data and openscience. In Bristol we are deploying a LoRaWAN network built on existingwireless infrastructure locations, provided by Bristol Wireless.\n\nIn this lecture I will introduce LoRaWAN from a technical perspective,providing examples, and also look at the IoT and LoRaWAN networks from apolitical perspective.\n\nI will bring a portable LoRaWAN network that we have developed at theUniversity of West of England, mostly for testing radio capabilities but alsoallowing us to demo LoRaWAN and IoT on the move, and also some example nodes,some of which will be used by the audience. This will demonstrate the use ofThe Things Network backend infrastructure to provide an internet backend andbring the internet part of Internet of Things. We will provide demos that theaudience will be able to interact with during the session and see the resultslive during the talk.\n\n\nRoom: K.1.105 (La Fontaine)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 11:00:00"
