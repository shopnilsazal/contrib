description: "PyData SV 2014 \nBig Data brings with it particular challenges in any language, mostly in performance. This talk will explain how to get immediate speedups in your Python code by exploiting both timeless programming techniques and fixes specific to Python. We will cover: I. Amongst Our Weaponry 1. How to Time and Profile Python 2. Extracting Loop invariants: constants, lookup tables, even methods! 3. Caching: memoization and heavier things II Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Morse Code 1. Python functions vs C functions 2. Vector operations: NumPy 3. Reducing calls: loops, generators, recursion III. The Semaphore Version of Wuthering Heights 1. Using select instead of Queue 2. Serialization overhead 3. Parallelizing work"
