description: "Richard Marcus, Casino Cheating and Fraud Consultant; Author of American Roulette, The Great Casino Heist, Dirty Poker, World's Greatest Gambling Scams, and Identity Theft, Incorporated\nPresented at the 22nd USENIX Security Symposium\n\nThe talk will open with an entertaining demonstration of what is widely considered the best casino-cheating move ever that made millions and fooled state-of-the-art video surveillance technology only because the move was so simple-stupid. Marcus will move on to cover how modern-day casino cheats use computers to scam tables and how casinos battle back with their own. He will discuss roulette computers, RFID technology, hacking into online gaming, and hacking into land casinos' security systems."
