description: "Functional Javascript: Reverse-engineering the Hype\n\nBegin with the End in Mind. We'll use this timeless adage to examine the hype behind functional programming patterns in javascript. In place of mathematical proofs, we'll look at the end results we can achieve with todays tools, and dive into the functional ideas that drive them in all parts of our front-end stack:\nFunctional Rendering: fn(component, appState) == UI\nData Management: Data flow for humans\nPerformance: First simple, then Fast\nSo leave the math textbooks at home, and get ready for a fast-paced tour of the tools and techniques you can use to get started with functional Javascript apps today."
