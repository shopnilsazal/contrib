description: "Taking the Helm: Delivering Kubernetes-Native Applications - Michelle Noorali and Matt Butcher, Deis & Adnan Abdulhussein, Bitnami\n\n\"The typical workflow for delivering an application on top of Kubernetes involves managing a bunch of manifest files in your Git repositories, and writing new manifests usually means copying lots of boilerplate. There are no standard ways to share and manage whatâ€™s running in your cluster. Enter Helm, a tool that streamlines the creation, deployment and management of Kubernetes-native applications. In this demo-led session, members of the CNCF Helm team show you how you can use Helm to improve your deployment workflows. \n\nThis presentation will cover:\n- The history of Helm\n- Deploying your first Chart\n- Making your application Kubernetes-native with Helm\n- Best practices for creating and configuring Kubernetes Charts\n- Guidelines for contributing official Kubernetes Charts\n- Setting up a Chart Repository to share your own Charts\"\n\nAbout Adnan Abdulhussein\nCore contributor and Chart maintainer on the Kubernetes Helm project\n\nAbout Matt Butcher\nDeis\n\nAbout Michelle Noorali\nCore Maintainer on the Kubernetes Helm project"
