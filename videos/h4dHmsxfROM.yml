description: "Mystic, Hacking the Mind (Influence and NLP)\n\nDo you ever find your self wondering if good social engineers and highly influential people are just born that way? Well, you might be surprised to find out that any human skill can be duplicated including being a master at influence. This is what forms the basis for a field of study known as NLP or Neuro-Linguistic-Programming. In this talk I will give an introduction to what NLP is and how it is used and will also provide you with some tools to help you better understand how you and others are influenced and how to exploit it.\n\nMystic is a strong believer that hacking at it's core has little to do with computers and more to do with how you chose to live your life. His interests go from electronic music to poetry to encryption to designing Texas Hold'em AIs. Once a resident of the San Francisco bay area, he traveled down south to find him self on the beaches of Santa Barbara and after two years is returning to finish school as a Psychology major at UC Santa Cruz."
