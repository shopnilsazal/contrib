description: "In the 1980's, Nintendo had plans for a knitting add-on to the NES, with an interface that resembled Mariopaint, but with patterned sweaters as output. Sadly, this product never saw the light of day. Devastated on hearing this, a group of Airbnb engineers (who knew nothing about machine knitting) set out to hack a knitting machine from the 1980's to be computer-controlled. Learn about how we wrote our own yarn printer API in ruby and printed our first doge meme in yarn. And watch us as we send knit requests to our yarn server, and behold as it knits ugly sweaters from those images!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FixG/"
