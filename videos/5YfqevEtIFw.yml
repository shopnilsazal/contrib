recordingDate: 1497561673
description: "Xianping Qu and Jingjing Ha, Baidu\n\nBaidu has thousands of applications and hundreds of thousands of servers. For high availability and reliability services, our SREs have developed many operation tools and systems. But, these tools are difficult to reuse and scale because of various of different operations concepts, runtime envoriments and operations strategies. Thus, we built a platform named AIOps platform (AI means automation and intelligence) to help SREs more quickly and efficiently develop operations tools. This platform provides unified operations abstract layer, operations strategies, automated scheduling and execution. Thus, SREs can focus on building their custom and advanced features.\n\nIn this talk, we demonstrate the core procedure of AIOps platform by actual cases in the productive environment of the core products at Baidu. The following technologies will be involved and mentioned: the platform architecture, OKB (operations knowledge base), OPAL(operations abstract layer), and practices in failover, auto scaling, etc.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon https://srecon.usenix.org"
