title: 'Building Web-Controlled AR Experiences at the NYTimes - Ramona Harrison'
recordingDate: 1527587567
description: "At The New York Times, we know that news doesnâ€™t wait for our next app release. When we set out to support Augmented Reality (AR) experiences in our newsreader app, it was essential to provide a way for fresh, timely AR stories to be built and deployed outside of the application build processes and normal release cycle.\n\nAlso, did we mention that our solution needed to work cross-platform so that the same AR experience could be authored once and delivered to work seamlessly for both our Android users on ARCore and iOS users on ARKit?\n\nWe explored the existing solutions and ultimately built our own: a web interface for loading and controlling content-agnostic AR experiences to be rendered by the native apps. This talk will survey the landscape of existing cross-platform and web-based AR approaches as well as demonstrate the solution that we built to bring fresh, cross-platform AR experiences to our readers."
