description: "Planes, Raft, and Pods: A Tour of Distributed Systems Within Kubernetes [B] - Bo Ingram, Craftsy\n\nKubernetes does some pretty neat things for you — autoscaling your app, rolling deploys, and more! In this talk, we’ll take a look at how Kubernetes leverages distributed systems to make its magic happen. We’ll do an overview of all components, but we’ll be concentrating on etcd, the controllers, and the scheduler. We’ll examine etcd and take a dive into the Raft algorithm to show how Kubernetes handles distributed state. We’ll take a look at some of the controllers to show how they reconcile the cluster’s state. We’ll also be shining a spotlight on the scheduler and show how we go from unscheduled to happy and running. Lastly, we’ll take the things we’ve learned and show how they work together to deploy an app by tracing an actual deployment through a cluster.\n\nAbout Bo Ingram\nBo Ingram is a Java platform engineer at Craftsy who spends his time flipping back and forth between backend feature development and infrastructure work. He has a problem where he buys more books than he can ever hope to read."
