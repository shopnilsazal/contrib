description: "Are you frustrated with developer response to the OWASP Top 10?\nDo you find yourself begging for security defects to get proper attention?\nDo you feel like you are in the loop on how software is getting built or surprised by what you are finding?\nIs there really any wonder that attackers are finding easy opportunities for malicious fame or gain? Is it possible that most everything we believe about how we endeavor to secure workloads is simply wrong? With the current migration of everything to code, complexity is increasing and so are opportunities to make mistakes. Because of this trend, it is essential that we re-evaluate how to implement security by pushing it as far to the left as possible and accelerating outcomes by making security consumable. Come hear how to engage in next generation security by leveraging the gift of feedback.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
