language: English
recordingDate: 1456428265
description: "Fake Twitter account @PeterMolydeux has been lovingly parodying Peter Molyneux's ambitious game ideas for years. In two weeks, Double Fine Productions' modest plan for a local game jam based on these tweets exploded into an international event, with over a thousand people participating in more than thirty cities worldwide. In this 2013 talk, programmer Anna Kipnis explains how Molyjam was invented, organized, and went viral in such a short time, and why jams like Molyjam are important to stave off creative stagnation. \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
