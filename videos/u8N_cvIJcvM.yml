description: "Perspective of the DoD Chief Security Officer\nRobert F. Lentz\n\nThe last year has been a tipping point for cyber security! Safeguarding the internet and the underlying critical information infrastructures has taken center stage as a National imperative. We share threats&vulnerabilities to these fragile underpinnings critical to our ability to sustain economic growth, foster international stability and achieve national security. Do we adequately collaborate across public and private sector for protection and defense? Is our risk appetite sufficient to manage the polarity between information sharing, access, and security? And what is the Military's role in defense of our cyber national security?\n\nMr. Lentz, as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense in both the Bush and Obama administrations and the first Senior Information Assurance Official for the Department of Defense serving since Nov 2000 will provide his perspective and lessons learned over several decades working in the cyber security field.
