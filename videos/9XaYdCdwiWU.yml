description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/materials/ \n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\n\nDrawing on lessons gleaned from recent hacker indictments, research on surveillance, espionage and counter-intelligence, this talk focuses on practical operational security (OPSEC) measures to avoid detection and prevent arrest by Law Enforcement Officials. The target audience for this talk are hacktivists whose primary mission requires strong online anonymity in the face of intense scrutiny from well funded antagonists.\nStarting with a review of OPSEC goals and moving onto methodologies, techniques and technologies, this presentation will enable the target audience to devise and implement robust OPSEC measures.\n\nEffective OPSEC requires combining strong technology solutions with disciplined cautious actions to minimize the exposure of \"protected information\". The talk will enumerate OPSEC principles and techniques to deny protected information to LEO, and equip hacktivists with the tools necessary to successfully conduct online operations while avoiding capture.\n\nABOUT THE GRUGQ\n\nA licensed manicurist by trade, the grugq rose from the ranks of the PLA's gold farming division to become one of the lead clicky-clicky technologists within the offensive cyber sphere. Currently under the patronage of the Asian Godfather of Hacking, living an austere existence as a practicing Buddhist monk in the mountains of Bangkok, The Grugq continues to advance the art of hiding things from the authorities."
