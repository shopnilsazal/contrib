description: "Real World Automation for Rapid Response\n\nMonzy Merza, Chief Security Evangelist, Splunk\n\nThis talk will discuss how you can automate incident response, with an emphasis on the foundational capabilities required for auto-response and how those capabilities are integrated. It will also highlight specific examples of end-to-end threat detection, response and mitigation. Note that it is very challenging for a talk of this nature to be 'immediately useful' and still be vendor neutral. We are not promoting any specific vendor, but we have to use some specific examples in the security ecosystem to make the content actionable – otherwise it’s too generic.\n\nWe will not be promoting any specific vendor as cyber operations require an ecosystem solution. We will use specific, real world examples of threat-intel, endpoint, network and identity management systems from a number of open source and closed source providers. Splunk is not in the network business, or the threat-intel business or the asset and identity management business, so examples will include other open source and closed source technology vendors.\nThe audience will learn why a balanced approach is required across the infrastructure; how and why to tie the pieces together; and how to conduct faster threat detection and incident response.\n\nEven if attendees don't have the exact product/vendor mix as our examples, they will learn how to think through and apply these tactics in their own environments.\n\nMonty Merza (Twitter: @monzymerza) Monzy serves as the Chief Security Evangelist at Splunk Inc. He has more than 15 years of tactical and cyber security research experience in government and commercial organizations. His experience includes vulnerability management, security product testing, penetration testing, adversary modeling, cyber tools and infrastructure development. Merza has served as content developer and instructor for cyber trainings and red/blue team exercises. He has also been an invited speaker at government and open conferences. Merza's current research is focused on integrated approaches to human driven and automated responses to targeted cyber attacks."
