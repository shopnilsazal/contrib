description: "PRESENTATION MATERIALS: \nhttp://gsec.hitb.org/materials/sg2015/\n\nPRESENTATION ABSTRACT:\nThe traditional security models are failing as they become obsolete in a world where the environment and technology are constantly changing and advancing.\n\nAs the use of personal devices and applications is on the rise such is the demand for broader access to enterprise resources wherever these are.\n\nThe need to allow anytime anywhere access to enterprise resources from any user, including external users, and any device, including devices an organization does not own or control, has challenged the mare existence of the fixed perimeter and the traditional defense mechanisms.\n\nThe enterprise trust model, which mistakenly substituted trust with ownership and control, can no longer be assumed in a BYOD world as access to resources cannot be granted just by relying on appropriate credentials especially if the user’s location and device are not under the enterprise’s control.\n\nIn a world where IT is losing control over devices, users and even it’s own infrastructure a new security model, that takes into account the new realities, must be put in place.\n\nABOUT OFIR ARKIN\n\nOfir Arkin is the VP and Chief Architect at McAfee where he is responsible for driving and coordinating the overall architectural vision across McAfee products.\n\nPrior to his current role, Ofir had served as the CTO for the Security Management Business, and was responsible for driving vision and product strategy for McAfee’s security management business unit.\n\nSince joining McAfee with the Insightix acquisition, Ofir has been leading cross-functional teams on the architecture, strategy and execution of the Data Exchange Layer and the Security Connected Framework. His work in this area created the design and has accelerated the development of DXL, culminating in the release of McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange, the first technology fully leveraging DXL.\n\nPrior to his tenure at McAfee, he founded Insightix, an innovator of real-time security intelligence and control solutions where he served as CTO. He has also authored numerous research papers, patents, patent applications, advisories and influential articles covering information warfare, network visibility, access control, VoIP security and remote OS fingerprinting."
