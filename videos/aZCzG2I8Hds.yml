description: "We take for granted that the goto statement is bad. Instead, we employ alternatives that make our code easier to understand and reason over, namely structured looping constructs such as while-loops and for-loops.\n\nBut have you ever considered that functional programmers look down on our looping constructs (or more specifically, our impure use of variables) in the same way we look down on goto? And they've got a point. By avoiding some of our most time-honoured tricks, we can end up with code that's not only easier to understand and reason over, but that scales better.\n\nJoe Albahari is the inventor of LINQPad and the author of the bestselling book on C# 5. He's written extensively on multithreading and parallel programming, and speaks regularly at user groups and conferences such as YOW! and TechEd.\n\nFor more on YOW!
