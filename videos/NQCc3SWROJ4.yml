title: 'Mira Mezini - Modular Composition of Reactive Applications'
recordingDate: 1498042541
description: "Abstract\nThis talk will present ongoing work in the context of the PACE (Programming Abstractions for Applications in Cloud Environments) ERC Advanced Grant. I will start by presenting core concepts of REScala, a language for concurrent and distributed reactive programming. Next, I will focus on our ongoing work on CorrL, a core language that aims at unifying concepts for reactives, events, and streams to enable a broad range of custom correlation behaviors, be it relational-algebra joins, CEP-style event patterns, RP combinators, or synchronization patterns. The key insight is to separate general-purpose and custom correlation semantics via an extensible effect system that enables fine-grained control over correlation semantics. I will conclude with a more speculative discussion of how I envision CorrLâ€™s concepts to be integrated into REScala and its generalized correlation semantics to be part of a module system for reactive cloud-based applications.\n\nBio\nMira Mezini is professor of computer science at Technische Universitaet Darmstadt, Germany. Together with her students and collaborators, she has made significant contributions in programming language design and implementation with special focus on fostering modularity and adaptability in software, software analysis techniques with special focus on security, and recommender systems for software engineering. She is (co)author of over 150 scientific publications, most of them in renown software engineering and programming language journals and conferences. Mira is member of editorial boards respectively steering committees of several international journals and conferences, such as JOT, TAOSD, AOSD, ECOOP, ESEC. She has served as the General Chair of AOSD 2005, and as the PC chair of AOSD 2008, ECOOP 2011, and ESEC/FSE 2013."
