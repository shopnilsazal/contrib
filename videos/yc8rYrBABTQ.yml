description: "RailsConf 2017: To Code Is Human by Don Werve\n\nProgramming is a deeply mental art. As programmers, we invest large amounts of time in mastering new languages, new techniques, and new tools. But all too often, we neglect our understanding of the most important tool in the developer's toolbox: the programmer's brain itself.\n\nIn this talk, we will combine the art of programming with the science of cognitive psychology, and emerge with a deeper understanding of how to leverage the limits of the human mind to sustainably craft software that is less buggy, easier to understand, and more adaptive in the face of change."
