description: "You've likely heard of Zend Framework, and possibly used versions 1 or 2. In January, the Zend Framework team announced plans for version 3, to be released this year, with major changes, including: splitting components into their own repositories and versions; evolving the ZF2 MVC framework to depend on the new, standalone components; supporting PSR-7 (HTTP Message interfaces) and providing middleware solutions to simplify development and optimize performance; updating the ZF2 MVC to consume PSR-7-based middleware, as well as provide middleware skeletons for serving ZF2-style applications; upgrading to PHP 5.5, and optimizing for PHP 7.\nDiscover how ZF3 will enable custom, Composer-based application stacks; provide both enterprise components and an MVC framework; and future-proof your applications for PHP 7. The session will provide not only a high-level overview of the changes, but detailed code examples. Learn about the new features of Zend Framework 3, and how its new approach enables broader re-use and higher velocity of innovation.\n\nhttps://joind.in/talk/view/14279\n\nCette vidéo vous a plu ?
