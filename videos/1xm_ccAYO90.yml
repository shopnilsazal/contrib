description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nHorizontal Pod Autoscaler Reloaded - Scale on Custom Metrics - Maciej Pytel, Google & Solly Ross, Red Hat (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nHorizontal Pod Autoscaling enables any cloud based service to handle changing demand while keeping resource utilization at the optimal level. In this talk Maciej and Solly will show how the introduction of custom metrics support makes Kubernetes autoscaling more powerful. You are now able to easily express scalability needs of your application and scale more types of workloads. Maciej and Solly will show how you can set it up for your application in just a few minutes and discuss best practices for using Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.\n\nAbout Solly\nSolly Ross is the SIG lead for SIG Autoscaling, and works on Kubernetes and OpenShift at Red Hat, with a focus on autoscaling and metrics. When not dabbling in other parts of the Kubernetes code base, Solly enjoys a wide range of programming topics, and can be found most places online as @directxman12.\n\nAbout Maciej\nMaciej Pytel works on Kubernetes autoscaling at Google, focusing on Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Cluster Autoscaler. Prior to Google, Maciej worked on multiple cloud orchestration projects (usually related to OpenStack) at Codilime."
