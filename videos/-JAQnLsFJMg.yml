description: 'Ever have one of those days where you sit back at the end of the day and realize that you didn''t get anything tangible done? Why do those days happen? Many times is it because we lack focus during the day to complete even the simplest of tasks. Our modern lives don''t allow us to practice focus; in fact they conspire against us being focused. This talk will explain why focus is important to productivity and teach one way you can practice focus through meditation.'
