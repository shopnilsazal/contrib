description: "by Davide Guerri\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nNowadays Trusted Platform Module is present in most computers, and it ismaking its way into embedded platforms as well. In this talk I will explainhow to use the (firmware)TPM2.0 available on the Minnowboard MAX/Turbot (seealso https://fb.me/MinnowBoardMax and https://fb.me/MinnowBoardTurbot) foreveryday's encryption (https://fb.me/tpm2-openssl)\n\nEven though TPMs are cryptographic processors, it is surprisingly hard to usethem for common cryptographic operations like signatures and decryption.\n\nMoreover, as opposed to its predecessor TPM1.2, TPM2.0 gets a very littlesupport in Linux and the TGC Software Stack has no support for the most commonencoding formats (e.g. PEM and DER).\n\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 14:00:00"
