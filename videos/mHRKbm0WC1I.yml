description: "Web development never gets boring to me. Not just because nowadays, new HTML5 technologies are emerging like tubes of spaghetti at a pasta factory - but mostly because there's always something new to learn.\nEven the oldest, most reliable features of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, the basics that we take for granted every day, are full of hidden gems or restrictions.\n\nDuring this talk, we'll take a look at the more obscure parts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and demystify some of them.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG35/"
