title: 'Million Browser Botnet - Jeremiah Grossman   Matt Johanssen'

description: "Online advertising networks can be a web hacker¹s best friend. For mere\npennies per thousand impressions (that means browsers) there are service\nproviders who allow you to broadly distribute arbitrary javascript -- even\nmalicious javascript! You are SUPPOSED to use this ³feature² to show ads,\nto track users, and get clicks, but that doesn¹t mean you have to abide.\nAbsolutely nothing prevents spending $10, $100, or more to create a\nmassive javascript-driven browser botnet instantly. The real-world power\nis spooky cool. We know, because we tested itŠ in-the-wild. Besides\nattacking ourselves we've also tested against a well known target with\nlots of DDoS protectionŠ Akamai.\n\nWith a few lines of HTML5 and javascript code we¹ll demonstrate just how\nyou can easily commandeer browsers to perform DDoS attacks, participate in\nemail spam campaigns, crack hashes and even help brute-force passwords.\nPut simply, instruct browsers to make HTTP requests they didn¹t intend,\neven something as well-known as Cross-Site Request Forgery. With CSRF, no\nzero-days or malware is required. Oh, and there is no patch. The Web is\nsupposed to work this way. Also nice, when the user leaves the page, our\ncode vanishes. No traces. No tracks.\n\nBefore leveraging advertising networks, the reason this attack scenario\ndidn¹t worry many people is because it has always been difficult to scale\nup, which is to say, simultaneously control enough browsers (aka botnets)\nto reach critical mass. Previously, web hackers tried poisoning search\nengine results, phishing users via email, link spamming Facebook, Twitter\nand instant messages, Cross-Site Scripting attacks, publishing rigged open\nproxies, and malicious browser plugins. While all useful methods in\ncertain scenarios, they lack simplicity, invisibility, and most\nimportantly -- scale. That¹s what we want! At a moment¹s notice, we will\nshow how it is possible to run javascript on an impressively large number\nof browsers all at once and no one will be the wiser. Today this is\npossible, and practical.\n\n  -\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
