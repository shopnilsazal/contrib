description: "PyData London 2018\n\nDesign engineers are often faced with the challenge of finding novel and high performing designs with limited information available to them. Bayesian methods lend themselves to design problems where information is limited and beliefs about what is a good design update over time. Using python is a great way to integrate design tools with Bayesian methods and accelerate the design process.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/jimparr19/pydata2018\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
