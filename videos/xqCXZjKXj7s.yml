description: "Why Diversity in Video Games Matters by Imran Khan\n\nWe've always been told that we're \"other\" when playing video games - even if people don't use those words, they never offer us the alternative. There's a default look for what a video game protagonist looks like and, if you do not fit that specific mold, you don't deserve representation. There are some games that try to change this and there are some that reinforce it harder than you thought possible. We have the ability to take hold of our medium and bring it forward so it represents all of us, not just the most marketable among us. The first step to that is identifying the failures our industry has repeated over and over in ignoring diversity. This talk intends to do just that."
