description: "Building Secure ASP.NET Core MVC Applications\n\nBuilding secure applications is a difficult task, especially in combination with building it based on a new application framework. ASP.NET Core is a new open-source and cross-platform framework completely rewritten from scratch. It can run on Windows, Mac and Linux and the framework moved to a more modular based approach which gives more flexibility when creating solutions with it.\n\nHow secure is ASP.NET Core by default? Do the API’s help the developer out doing a good job or is a mistake easily made? In this session, we're going to investigate how ASP.NET Core MVC deals with the above questions related to e.g. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issues. We’re also going to extend it and adapt new web standards and see how we can validate an existing solution for the problems we’ve identified.\n\n\nSecurity Researcher, Veracode\nNiels Tanis has got a background in .NET development, pentesting and security consultancy. He also holds the CSSLP certification and has been involved in breaking, defending and building secure applications.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
