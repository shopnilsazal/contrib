language: English
recordingDate: 1474126182
description: "Maciej Dziergwa\n\nIn 2005 I became keen on programming in Python, but at the time there were no job opportunities for Python developers in Poland.\n\nThatâ€™s why I decided to start my own Python Software House, and today I employ more than 200 people, including over 100 Python developers. Over 11 years of experience in company leadership allows me to see this career path from a wider perspective.\n\nI realize now, how easy it is to make wrong decisions, underestimate threats or undervalue opportunities.\n\nI will gladly share some lessons learnt from working with more than 100 clients, dozens of Python frameworks, and last but not least, a great number of talented developers."
