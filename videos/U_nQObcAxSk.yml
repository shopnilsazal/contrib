recordingDate: 1492119862
description: "Monitor My Socks: Using Prometheus in a Polyglot Open Source Microservices Reference Architecture [I] - Phil Winder, Winder Research/Container Solution\n\nThis presentation describes how Prometheus was integrated into a polyglot microservices application. We will use the \"Sock Shop\", a cloud-native reference microservices architecture to demonstrate some of the best practices and pitfalls of attempting to unify monitoring in real life. Attendees will be able to use this application as a reference point, or as a real life starting point for their own applications.\n\nSpecifically, we will cover:\n- Integrating Prometheus in Java/Go/Node.js/Haskell\n- Best practices: what to monitor and how to structure the monitoring code\n- Pitfalls: what goes wrong and why\n- Demonstrations and descriptions how attendees can try it for themselves\n\nAbout Phil Winder\nPhil Winder is a multi-disciplinary freelance architect working towards the research and development of cutting-edge technology. Most recently he has been developing cloud-based full-stack microservice systems for a range of clients but has a significant past in machine learning and electronics. His company, WinderResearch.com, is collaborating with Container Solutions, a container consultancy, to provide R&D services in the container space.
