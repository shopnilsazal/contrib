description: "Ben Nuttall - Physical computing with Python and Raspberry Pi\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n[Education Summit]\n\nWith the Raspberry Pi, it's easy to do physical computing directly\nfrom Python code - rather than usual embedded hardware engineering in\nC or Assembler.\n\nIn this talk I'll show examples of physical computing projects that\nuse Python on Raspberry Pi and demonstrate the sort of code  used in\nsuch projects.\n\nPhysical computing with Python is very popular in education - as it's\nso engaging, and more interesting than printing to the screen.\n\nThis will be an informative session with learning possibilities to\ngive those new to physical computing a change to get started."
