title: 'Of Death and Dying: A Journey to Trunk Based Development'
recordingDate: 1530193012
description: "Matthias Huttar tells the story of Nora and her Dionysus team. They're brave enough to try out trunk based development to address some of the issues they have with delivering quality fast. This talk is an entertaining story - in the spirit of the Phoenix Project - about a team that moves from Github flow to head based development. It covers the theory of the process from a technical, but also from a cultural stand point.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
