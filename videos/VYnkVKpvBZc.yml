description: "A stereotypical image of a successful game development project involves a perfect plan and its precise execution. However, the reality is often diametrically opposite to that ideal. On the example of The Talos Principle, a game that wasn't even supposed to be made, Croteam's project leaders Davor Hunski and Alen Ladavac talked during GDC 2015 about how the best things in games are creative reactions to emerging circumstances, not implementations of marketing bullet points\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
