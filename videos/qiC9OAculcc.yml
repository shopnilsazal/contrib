description: "This talk runs through examples of services creating more brittle systems with worse failure cases. Building on those failure scenarios, I draw out guidelines for if, when, and how to consider Service Oriented Architecture. Software architecture is informed both by principles of software design and principles of operability; for lots of us, there are new skills to learn there. Also, set to music, this talk becomes a cool remake of StarWars, Episode 1.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H4aN/"
