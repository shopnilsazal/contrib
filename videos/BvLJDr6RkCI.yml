recordingDate: 1432652206
description: "By, Eduardo Gutierrez\nCapybara has allowed us to build complex and ambitious applications with the confidence that everything comes together in the user experience we're targeting. As the capabilities of the web have grown, interactions and behavior in our applications have become more complex and harder to test. Our tests become coupled to CSS selectors, fail intermittently, take longer and our confidence dwindles. In this talk, I'll go over best practices for working with a large Capybara test suite and dig into APIs and options we can use to handle complex apps such as a chat app not written in Ruby."
