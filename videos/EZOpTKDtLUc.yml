description: "by Dana Jacobsen\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nNumber theory is the basis for much of modern cryptography, but it is alsoprovides many interesting small problems for programmers to solve. From one ofthe oldest algorithms to some new ones, we'll look at some ways to implementthem in Perl 6 and how the language helps makes this easier for us. Some ofthe topics covered will be primality, prime generation, factoring, and RSA.\n\n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 11:25:00"
