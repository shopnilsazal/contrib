description: "RailsConf 2018: Human Powered Rails: Automated Crowdsourcing In Your RoR App by Andy Glass\n\nMachine learning and AI are all the rage, but there’s often no replacement for real human input. This talk will explore how to automate the integration of human-work directly into a RoR app, by enabling background workers to request and retrieve data from actual human workers. The secret is Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing marketplace connecting ‘requesters’ who post tasks with ‘workers’ who complete them. Attendees will learn how to automate the completion of human tasks (e.g. price research, image tagging, sentiment analysis, etc) with impressive speed, accuracy and scalability."
