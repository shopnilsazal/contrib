recordingDate: 1391561757
description: "Aaron Higbee: Hack Your Car for Boost and Power!\nWhat happens when you combine a natural hacker, a computer controlled car, and security consultant's discretionary income spent on a pile of parts? A four cylinder, 2.5 liter, 500hp monster daily driver that runs on pump gas. (Pump gas plus computer controlled methanol injection for that extra umph.) \nIf you love the smell of gasoline and want to learn about performance tuning and ECU hacking, then this presentation is for you. If you have the dealer change your oil for fear of voiding the warranty, then you may want to skip this presentation. ?\nAttendees will be introduced to the tools of the trade and tuning concepts that are meant to squeeze out every last drop of power. Concepts will be backed up by practical examples and advice that the audience member can take away and try on their own (?.if they dare). The presentation will cover automotive protocols, sensors, and tuning concepts used in making power. The presentation will cover the role of octane, water injection, and methanol injection as a means of coping with high boost turbocharged applications.\nBasic knowledge of electronic fuel injection and how a motor works is recommended. An understanding of the mechanics of turbochargers and supercharges is a plus but is not required.\nThe presentation will conclude with car modification laws, CARB, emissions testing, SEMA, and privacy concerns about the data an ECU can store.\n\n\n\n\nAaron Higbee is a Managing Partner and co-founder of the Intrepidus Group. He has over 10 years of information security experience with reputed companies like Foundstone, Lucent Technologies, and EarthLink.\nAaron built his information security career on a passion for understanding technology and pushing its limits. It's the natural extension of a curious mind to want to be in control of his cars ECU in order to find out what it really can do. As a gearhead hobbyist, Aaron has spent the past six years exploring ECU tuning and performance modifications. His time and effort has produced heart pounding, neck snapping, dyno proven results, and a passion to share this knowledge with those who are interested.\nAaron is a speaker at leading industry conferences like Black Hat, Def Con, and Hack-In-The-Box. In addition, he is often invited to guest lecture on advanced information security concepts at the nation's top universities including Carnegie Mellon. He has delivered security training courses to over 1000 information security officers of US government agencies and Fortune 500 companies."
