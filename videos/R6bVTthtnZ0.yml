description: "What does it take to deploy an application without any downtime?\n\nMore than most Ruby developers would expect, turns out; what is aggravated by the lack of documentation and other resources on this topic.\n\nIn this talk we'll dive into both development practices (hot compatibility, database migrations, caching) and deployment setup (Heroku, Unicorn, HAProxy), covering everything you need to know in order to ship code without affecting a single customer."
