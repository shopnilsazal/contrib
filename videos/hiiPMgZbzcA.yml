Using Docker, your applications will sit atop an excellent platform for packing, shipping and running low-overhead, isolated execution environments. You will get a brief intro to the Docker ecosystem, get to know the tools and processes needed to create containerized applications, and learn best practices for interacting with the Docker API and CLI.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H4Of/"
