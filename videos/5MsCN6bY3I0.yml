description: "Kenneth Geers: Ipv6 World Update: High Diplomacy & Monster Trucks\n\nAbstract: Governments around the world are investing serious time, effort, and money into the next gen Internet, based on IP version 6. With important mandatory and remarkably close deadlines looming for v6 deployment, much yet remains to be understood about its security and socio-economic implications as well as our readiness to fully embrace it. While Europe and Asia have been trailblazing IPv6 industry for years now, the U.S. Government has mandated that its organizations be IPv6-compliant by June 30, 2008, yet the vague definition of compliance has already confused many considering dual-stack, tunneled and/or native environments. Imagine the bliss of IPv6 telematics, mobility, autoconfiguration, \"mandatory IPSec\" encrypted traffic and enough IPs to globally address everything with a battery or even a reference to a snippet of code for the world to access. Now imagine your firewalls and IDS sensors being blind to IPSec or even just cleartext 6to4 tunneled traffic. Debunking many myths, such as IPv6 \"built-in security\", prior to the transition is key as we watch the beloved IPv4 become legacy, say goodbye to NAT and the 6bone and welcome more DNSSEC, tunnel brokers and distributed PKI firewalls?! This presentation will cover wide-ranging research the authors have conducted and the new paradigm shift necessary to approach IPv6 differently than IPv4, including interviews with some of world's top thinkers about the sleeping giant. Whether it is yet another gov-hyped failed theory like GOSSIB or it is here to stay, you will take away enormous insight into the work that you may be responsible for and dependent on over the next several years."
