title: 'Windows 8 Security: Supporting User Confidence'
recordingDate: 1378233185
description: "Crispin Cowan, Senior Program Manager, Windows Core Security, Microsoft, Inc.\nPresented at the 22nd USENIX Security Symposium\n\nComputing appliances should let users just use the device without having to having to \"be careful\" what they click on. Worse, \"being careful\" doesn't even work anymore, as attackers have invaded nearly every aspect of digital life, and so could be lurking in search engine results, social networks, and even app stores. Windows 8 provides security features such as malware resistance, app isolation, and modernized access controls that defend against attacks by both technical and social means, giving the user the confidence to click what they want. Windows 8 can be used by any member of the family, and network administrators can confidently deploy Windows 8 to their users, without fearing that the user will be co-opted by attackers."
