description: "My good friend Danny Blitz did this presentation at Mountain West Ruby Conference 2009.  It has some really good insights on software development, teams, and life.\n\nIt's with great sadness that I have to tell you that Danny Blitz passed away on August 11, 2012.\n\nhttp://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Daniel-Blitz&lc=7484&pid=159080122&mid=5201518&locale=en_US\n\nHe was a man who had little fear of rejection.  You could sit him down and tell him all the negative things in a given situation and he'd find a way to pick up a positive aspect of it and trumpet the good news.\n\nHe will be missed!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGid/"
