description: "I will show how to use Go's database/sql package, with MySQL as an example. Although the documentation is good, it's dense. I'll discuss idiomatic database/sql code, and cover some topics that can save you time and frustration, and perhaps even prevent serious mistakes.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0W/"
