description: 'Command-line interface is one of the oldest, yet commonly used human-computer interface, where users type textual commands with arguments to get desired results. Developers often provide command-line options for software applications along with graphical user interface. Several programming languages provide standard libraries to help programmers parse and handle command-line arguments. However, both CLI and libraries have evolved all these years, standardizing the way how commands are built and adding along with new functionalities like the use of colours, auto-completion, auto-correction etc. Yet there is a lot of scope for improvement, notably for creating a multilingual interface, obtaining the progress of a command, furthering the use of colours etc.'
