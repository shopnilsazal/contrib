description: "Google Tech Talk (more info below)\r\nJune 6, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Professor Hadley Wickham from Rice University.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nWhat's next for interactive graphics in R?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss the past, present and future of interactive graphics, with a focus on our work developing a next generation graphics canvas for R.  Our initial experiments are very promising - with the right C primitives, it's possible to write fast interactive and dynamic graphics using pure R code. I'll talk about the three new R packages that make this possible (qtbase, qtpaint and plumbr), and discuss the new cranvas package, where we are rewriting the interactive and dynamic graphics tool GGobi with pure R code.\r\n\r\nI'll also show off some custom visualisations of the general social survey and migration patterns within the US.\r\n\r\nThis is joint work with Di Cook, Heike Hofmann, Michael Lawrence, and the Iowa State data visualisation group.\r\n\r\nAbout the Speaker:\r\n\r\nHadley developed ggplot2, one of the most popular graphics packages of R."
