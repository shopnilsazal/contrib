description: "Become a Patron now: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/funfunfunction\n\nThank you so much for being (or considering becoming) a patron of Fun Fun Function!\n\nI have quit my job at Spotify, and I am now part-time consultant and the other part of my time will now be dedicated to Fun Fun Function. Fun Fun Function is now officially my proper part-time job, instead of something that I cram in on the weekends.\n\nSo today I am asking you, if you want, to become a Patron of Fun Fun Function. \n\nAs a patron, you chip in a few bucks every month - whatever amount you feel is appropriate. \nI will use your money to keep the show free for everyone and make the show better. \nAs a patron, you also get some rewards - most importantly the newly opened Fun Fun Forum (https://www.funfunforum.com)."
