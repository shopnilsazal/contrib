description: "Follow me on a journey where we pwn one of the most secure platforms on earth – a giant mammoth that to this day powers the most critical business functions around the world: The Mainframe! Be it a wire transfer, an ATM withdrawal, or flight booking, you can be sure that you’ve used the trusted services of a mainframe at least once during the last 24 hours.\n\nCICS or the Customer Information Control System was developed by IBM to host and develop interactive application mainly on z/OS as well as handle an important volume of transactions. It is the most widely deployed transaction system in the world with more than 20 billion transactions a day relying on its services.  Indeed for every person that withdraws money, there is a good to fair chance that multiple CICS applications are involved somewhere in the chain of request. Same goes for banking operators when creating a new account, handling refunds, etc.\n\nIn this talk, I will present methods on pentesting mainframe applications, deploying shells and elevating privileges on the system,  all starting with zero authentication. If you are interested in mainframes or merely curious to see a what a shell looks like on MVS, you’ll want to attend this session.\n\n===\n\nAyoub is a pentester working for Wavestone, a consulting firm based in France. He got interested in Mainframe security in 2014 when, during an audit, he noticed the big security gap between this platform and standard systems like Windows and Unix. A gap that does not make much sense because z/OS has been around for a while and is used by most major companies to perform critical business operations: wire transfer, claim refunds, bookings, etc. If you want to test some of the tools showcased during the talk, you can check out his tools: https://github.com/ayoul3/ or blog https://zospentest.tumblr.com"
