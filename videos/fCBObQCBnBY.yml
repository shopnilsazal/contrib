title: 'Alex Thomas - Vocabulary Analysis of Job Descriptions'
recordingDate: 1500906151
description: "Description\nWe will explore how to do some basic natural language processing (NLP) on the text including tokenization and stemming to combine word forms, and stop word removal and sentence detection to examine word sequences (n-grams). We will then look at the distribution of the vocabulary terms and n-grams in our data set using term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF.IDF).\n\nAbstract\nIn the initial analysis of a data set it is useful to gather informative summaries. This includes evaluating the available fields, by finding unique counts or by calculating summary statistics such as averages for numerical fields. These summaries help in understanding what is in the data itself, the underlying quality, and illuminate potential paths for further exploration. In structured data, this a straightforward task, but for unstructured text, different types of summaries are needed. Some useful examples for text data include a count of the number of documents in which a term occurs, and the number of times a term occurs in a document. Since vocabulary terms often have variant forms, e.g. “performs” and “performing”, it is useful to pre-process and combine these forms before computing distributions. Oftentimes, we want to look at sequences of words, for example we may want to count the number of times “data science” occurs, and not just “data” and “science”. We will use the pandas Python Data Analysis Library and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to process a data set of job descriptions posted by employers in the United States, and look at the difference in vocabularies across different job segments.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
