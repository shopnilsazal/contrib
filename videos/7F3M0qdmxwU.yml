description: "Many of us came to Ruby by way of Rails (including yours truly about six years ago). We came because our current solutions were clumsy and inconvenient. We came because we appreciated the relative simplicity that Rails offered. And we came because we believe that change is often a good thing.\n\nBut not all changes are beneficial.\n\nOver several blog posts, books, and a couple of years, the Rails community has begun to choose complexity over simplicity.
