description: "By, Randy Coulman\nWe all run into legacy code. Sometimes, we even write it ourselves. Working with legacy code can be a daunting challenge, but there are ways to tackle it. The Gilded Rose code kata is a coding exercise for practicing refactoring and testing skills in a legacy codebase.\n\nIn this presentation, I use the Gilded Rose kata to demonstrate techniques for safely working with a legacy codebase and using pure baby-step refactorings to improve the design.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FV8n/"
