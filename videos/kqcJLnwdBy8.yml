recordingDate: 1433006400
description: "Python is the perfect language to build with little effort a framework to control and hack the growth of a company. Being import.io data scientist for the last 2 years, I've come across many different problems and needs on how to wrangle data, clean data, report on it and make predictions. In this talk I will cover all main analytics and data science needs of a start-up using Python, numpy, pandas, and sklearn. We will go through examples of how to wrangle analytics and KPIs in Python, and make simple models to do basic predictions that can really make the difference in the business world. For every use case I there will be snippets of code using IPython notebooks and some will be run as live demos.\n\nIgnacio Elola"
