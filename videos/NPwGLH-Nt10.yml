description: "DevOpsDays Boston 2017- Why You Need to Stop Using 'THE' Staging Server by Chloe Condon\n\nOld staging methodology is broken for modern development. In fact, the staging server is left over from when we built monolithic applications. Find out why microservice architectures are driving ephemeral testing environments & why every sized dev shop should deliver true continuous deployment.\n\nStaging servers slow down development with merge conflicts, slow iteration loops, and manhour intensive processes. To build better software faster containers and infrastructure as code are key in 2017. Dev Ops professionals miss this talk at their own peril."
