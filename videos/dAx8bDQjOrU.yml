Binary protocols are making a comeback in popularity. We will looks at the advantages and disadvantages of binary as well as how some of the protocols such as Flatbuffers, Capn'n Proto, Protobuf, etc differ.\n\nAbout Jason Smith\nJason is a backend engineer who has 10 years of experience in building integrations, and yet he still doesn't hate SOAP. He is a devout student of the K.I.S.S. philosophy. He has become focused on microservices, and the best practices for developing in a distributed environment."
