description: "Writing REST APIs is often the first choice when exploring distributed architectures. HTTP is well known and well understood protocol which helps when going through architectural revolution. This is why most of the applications have HTTP server at their heart. However was the choice of HTTP server an informed one, or did it come with the framework? What is the architecture of your HTTP server and tradeoffs that come with it?\n\nMain focus of this talk is presenting the design and internal architecture of two commonly used HTTP servers: Tomcat and Undertow. What are the differences in threading model? How are requests processed before they reach controller class? Which parameters to tune and how to measure that tuning helped? You will get to know all this after visiting my presentation."
