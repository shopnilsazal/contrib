description: "Ruby 2 Methodology by Akira Matsuda\n\nThis talk focuses on \"Method\" in Ruby.\n\nAlthough Method is the key feature of an OOP language like Ruby, Ruby's Method is still drastically evolving. This session is a quick tour on new features and changes around Method in recent versions of the Ruby language. Not just introducing the APIs, we'll also show you lots of interesting stories behind these features, and real-world code examples. Through this session, you'll probably learn some modern methods of Ruby programming that you did never know.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/H0pe/"
