title: '#HITBGSEC 2017 CommSec D1 - Execute Code On A Forensic Workstation - F. Lukavsky & W. Ettlinger'
recordingDate: 1505711850
description: "EnCase Forensic Imager is a tool used by forensic investigators to gather evidence from storage media. We used a custom tool to fuzz the file system parser code of this product and found a buffer overflow vulnerability in the LVM2 parser.\n\nWe demonstrate our approach we used to fuzz EnCase Forensic Imager, describe the technical details of the vulnerability and show how this vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the investigatorâ€™s machine. We wrap up our talk by discussing the impact of this vulnerability on forensic evidence.\n\n=== \n\nFlorian Lukavsky started his hacker career in early ages, bypassing parental control systems. Since then, he reported numerous zero-day vulnerabilities responsibly to software vendors and conducted hundreds of pentests and security reviews as a CREST certified, ethical hacker.\n\nToday, Florian Lukavsky heads SEC Consult in Singapore and the APAC region. With offices in Europe, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia, SEC Consult is an international leader in application security services, information security consultancy and provides innovative security solutions like CyberTrap. Having defined security standards and regulations in Europe, SEC Consult and Florian are now devoting their expertise to aid Singaporean organizations to be ahead of cyber criminals.\n\n---\n\nWolfgang Ettlinger has worked as a technical security consultant for SEC Consult for the past 4 years. He graduated MSc Secure Information Systems at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria. He has an interest in many information security topics ranging from binary exploitation to cryptography. In the past years, Wolfgang Ettlinger published several security advisories demonstrating vulnerabilities in multiple software products."
