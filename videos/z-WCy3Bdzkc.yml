recordingDate: 1384985092
description: "Hacking the Apple TV and Where your Forensic Data Lives\nKevin Estis Security Researcher\nRandy Robbins Security Researcher\n\nThis is a primer for both newbie Apple TV hackers and digital forensics investigators. The intent of the presentation is to show how easy it is to modify an Apple TV to run 3rd-party applications and also point out where the Apple TV tracks your activities (including files played, applications installed, and connected networks).\n\nKevin Estis has over 17 years experience in finding bad people on good networks...and vice-versa. His Master's project in Digital Forensics was on Apple TV forensics so that he could convince he wife that an Apple TV would be put to good use. Since then he's broken and fixed the Apple TV more times than he can count.\n\nRandy Robbins has many years of experience in IT Security and breaking stuff. Armed with a Master's Degree in Digital Forensics, he is working to spread the knowledge of secure computing to whomever will listen to his rantings.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
