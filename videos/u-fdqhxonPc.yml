We will show you how configure multiple configurations for your test setup (example: OS & Browser combos), how to create a test plan, and execute a test. We also cover how tests can link to the work your team needs to do to fix problems and all activity has full traceability with test run history and links between work and executed tests. \n\nFor more information see our documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/manual-test/?view=vsts\n\nSpeaker: Donovan Brown"
