description: "by Jan Dittrich and Charlie Kritschmar\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nUX Design is often understood as creating an interface and testing if it isusable. But it can also include finding out what would be useful and servesusers’ needs.\n\nMethods to analyze user needs exits, however, they may assume a lot ofresources or don’t consider community driven work.\n\nWe want to demonstrate methods we used for Wikidata and Mediawiki to *research user needs * use the findings to improve our software\n\nWe want to particularly highlight\n\n  * How to do this with few resources  * How to involve an open source community  * How to involve team members who are not designers\n\nWe hope to enable participants of the session to use the methods in theirprojects and communities and encourage to develop the methods further.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:00:00"
