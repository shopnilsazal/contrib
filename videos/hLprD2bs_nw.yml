recordingDate: 1383377400
description: "Vulnerability Databases (VDBs) have provided information about security vulnerabilities for over 10 years. This has put VDBs in a unique position to understand and analyze vulnerability trends and changes in the security industry. This panel presentation will examine vulnerability information over the past several years with an emphasis on understanding security researchers, quality of research, vendors, disclosure trends and the value of security vulnerabilities. The emotional debate surrounding Full Disclosure has raged on for decades. This panel will use grounded data to discuss salient points of the debate to hopefully determine trends that may influence the debate. Maybe even in a positive fashion!\n\nFull Bios are available here: \nhttps://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-19/dc-19-speakers.html#Panel0day"
