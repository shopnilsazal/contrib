description: "Tony Kapela - Fashonably Late - What Your Networks RTT Says About Itself\nFashonably Late - What Your Networks RTT Says About Itself\n\nIn this session, we will explore network fingerprinting through the use of high-frequency active probes to determine the network's delay. We will also discuss how signal analysis techniques on those delay measurements can be employed to characterize a network's performance and configuration. Using examples from a real-world enterprise network, various layer-1 and layer-2 features will be exposed including: a router or switch's queuing behavior, evidence of unrelated cross-traffic, and the presence of a configured monitoring or \"span\" port, perhaps indicating the presence of an eavesdropper.\n\nTony Kapela still has too much time on his hands. He's spoken at the past two Defcons with Adam Shand and Bruce Potter on various wireless network topics, and was a pannelist at Rubicon 5.\n\nCurrently He is spending time volunteering in a network research lab at the University Of Wisconsin, Madison, and does freelance network engineering & RF system design.\n\nFor balance, Tony often climbs radio towers (it's not really work, is it?) and hones his skills at bass guitar and percussion performance."
