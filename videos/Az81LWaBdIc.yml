description: "Yulia Zozulya\n\nDevelopers make peculiar users. We’re very picky on what settings we want, and if we can tweak something we will.

Knowing this, when making tools for developers, we often face many challenges and interesting scenarios on how to best define settings, what the defaults should be and how to make them easily discoverable. This session will provide some examples of what developers typically request in terms of features, how tricky it can be to balance between the variety of requested options and the aim for simplicity."
