title: 'Why you should mock your IoT device during development and how to do this? by Antoni Kędracki'

description: "Someone once said, \"hardware is hard\". I couldn’t agree more. You modify your design. Order a prototype to be manufactured. Wait a couple of days/weeks for it. Then you test it only to find yet another bug. Then you repeat the whole process. Delays are to be expected. In the meantime, you would like to work on your mobile application. But how can you do that without being able to connect to an actual device?\n\nIn my talk, I would like to explain why I think the answer to this question is a hardware mock. This imitation can be constructed from off-the-shelf development boards with minimal electronic engineering skills. They allow the application development team to start work even before the first hardware prototypes arrive. They can be also used to magically multiply the available prototypes so that each developer has access to one.\n\nI will then continue by showing a working mock setup for a simple Bluetooth LE enabled device."
