description: "Are you an aspiring entrepreneur with a passion for Ruby? Do you think Ruby can help you on your path to creating a successful internet startup? I was once in your same shoes. When I entered the Ruby community I had no open source, no accolades, and no visibility. Over the course of several years I inserted myself into the Ruby ecosystem, got myself to San Francisco, and founded GitHub with a team of kickass Ruby developers. This talk will chronicle those events and I'll shower you with insights on how to make the same journey from anonymous hacker to successful entrepreneur!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GXlE/"
