description: "Stefan Baerisch - A Deep Look at Logging\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nDo you know what your application did last night? Python logging can help you.\n\nThis talk you will show you how to implement a systematic logging\napproach without boilerplate code and how to set up the Python logging\nmodule for different needs in production systems.  We will see how to\nwork with log files and other logging endpoints.  We will address the\ndata protection concerns that come up when logging  from application\nwith personal  information. We will also look at the performance\nimplications of logging. We will then cover best practices - how to\nstructure logging, what to include in a log message, and how to\nconfigure logging for different use cases.\n\nWe will use the Python standard logging module to implement logging.\nThis talk is useful to beginners with some experience.  An\nunderstanding of decorators is useful, but not required.  Some\nexperience in web programming is a plus."
