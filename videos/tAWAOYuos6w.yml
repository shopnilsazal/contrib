description: "By Ian Colle\nAs the size and performance requirements of cloud deployments increases, storage architects are increasingly seeking new architectures that scale.\n\nCeph is a fully open source distributed object store, network block device, and file system designed for reliability, performance, and scalability from terabytes to exabytes. Ceph utilizes a novel placement algorithm (CRUSH), active storage nodes, and peer-to-peer gossip protocols to avoid the scalability and reliability problems associated with centralized controllers and lookup tables.\n\nCeph's architecture is based on RADOS, an object store with support for snapshots and distributed computation. Ceph offers a Swift and S3-compatible REST API for seamless data access to RADOS. Ceph's network block device can be used to store large images and volumes in RADOS, supporting thin provisioning and snapshots. Ceph has native support for Qemu/KVM, libvirt, CloudStack and OpenStack which makes it an attractive storage option for cloud deployments.\n\nAs a result of participating in this session, attendees will gain a full understanding of the Ceph architecture, its current status, and plans for future development. Attendees will also learn how Ceph integrates with OpenStack to provide a unified object and block storage service.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0G/"
