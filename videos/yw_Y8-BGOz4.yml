description: "Nicholas Tollervey - Lessons learned with asyncio (\"Look ma, I wrote a distributed hash table!\")\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nThis talk introduces the asyncio module. I'll cover what it's for, how\nit works and describe how I used it to write a real-world networked\napplication (a distributed hash table). We'll explore the event loop,\ncoroutines, futures and networking with examples from my code. This\nwon't be an exhaustive exposition. Rather, attendees will grasp enough\nof asyncio to continue with their own studies.\n\nBy the end of this introductory talk I hope attendees will want to\nlearn more about asyncio and perhaps give it a try in their own\nprojects."
