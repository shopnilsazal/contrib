recordingDate: 1528977003
description: "What to do when your meticulous design process hits a snag? Or when you follow every step and still don't reach the intended outcome?\n\nProcesses are integral to how we work, navigating us through ambiguity. However, strict processes can also weaken our ability to deliver if we're unable to respond to change.\n\nWhether in the upstream or iterating on nitty gritty details, hear how principles commonly adopted by agile software development can help you continuously learn and improve your work.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. How to overcome obstacles in your design work and learn from failures?\n2. How to increase your and your team's adaptability to respond to change?\n3. How to adopt and work with flexible guiding principles instead of strict processes?\n\nBreakpoint is a conference for developers and designers who value real talk, tangible outcomes and quick results. The latest edition of Breakpoint was held in Helsinki, Finland in May 2018.
