description: "RailsConf 2018: Mechanically Confident by Adam Cuppy\n\nThe idea that confidence is solely the result of positive self-talk is circular: If I believed in my ability to talk myself up, I would. But if I did, I wouldn't need to talk myself up. It's not as simple as having faith.\n\nThere's a thread amongst all peak performers and skilled practitioners: specific habits, routines, and processes that wrap uncertainty and create confidence. Oscar-winning actors rehearse, pro-drivers do laps, chefs prep.\n\nThis talk will help you recognize and design habits, routines, and practices that embed confidence into the body."
