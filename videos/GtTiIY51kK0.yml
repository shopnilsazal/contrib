recordingDate: 1529904970
description: "The Swagger specification is all grown up with it's new enterprisey name, OpenAPI and there's a whole set of new features in V3, like links and callbacks. This session will explore what's new in OpenAPI V3 while designing and building an HTTP API.\n\nMost Swagger/OpenAPI users started by generating their OpenAPI from an API implementation. As developers gain experience, many start to change their approach to start with an OpenAPI description and build an implementation from that. We will compare the approaches and talk about the advantages of Contract First with OpenAPI."
