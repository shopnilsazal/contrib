description: "by Matt Jordan\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nThere are many considerations when building a large SIP infrastructure. Thistalk will focus on some of the key challenges and decisions that must be madewhen designing such a system, and how Asterisk can be deployed as ahorizontally scalable application server in such a system.\n\nWhile there is no right way to build a large SIP infrastructure, there arecertainly wrong ways. Often, design decisions have to be made early in theconstruction of an infrastructure that balance trade-offs affectingperformance, scalability, and ease of development/deployment.\n\nThis talk will explore these trade-offs and design decisions when buildingsuch an infrastructure using Kamailio and Asterisk. This includesinvestigating considerations surrounding: * Managing SIP location andregistration * Call routing * SIP subscriptions and event handling *Communications application development\n\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 11:10:00"
