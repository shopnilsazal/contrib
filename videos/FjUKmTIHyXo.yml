description: 'What happens when we prototype an app entirely in FP? From choosing a functional database to building http apis and designing templates and stylesheets—it is possible these days, to stay entirely in FP land! In this talk I will share my experience in building functional prototypes with Clojure & Clojurescript using the following libraries: Datomic, Ring, Om, and Garden. I’ll discuss how we can trade popular databases, web toolkits, template engines, and even less and sass in favor of simpler libraries that embrace immutable data as a “Sequence of Values”.'
