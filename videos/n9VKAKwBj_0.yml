description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nUnderstanding Distributed Consensus in etcd and Kubernetes - Laura Frank, Codeship (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nThe Raft consensus algorithm is at the core of etcd, allowing you to run highly available services across your Kubernetes cluster. But how exactly does quorum work, what happens when a node goes down, and how do all of the machines agree on the actual state of your services? Where is the Raft log stored, and how can you inspect it? Come away with deeper understanding of two of Raft&rsquo;s main responsibilities, log replication and leader election, and be better equipped to make informed choices about your service declarations and cluster configurations.\n\nAbout Laura\nAs the Director of Engineering at CloudBees and a Docker Captain, Laura's primary focus is making tools for other developers. At CloudBees, she works on improving the Docker infrastructure of the Codeship product and overall experience for all users of the CI/CD platform. Previously, she worked on several open source projects to support Docker in the early stages of the project, including Panamax and ImageLayers. She currently lives in Vienna."
