Now is a good time to take stock of Kubernetes' image building support from the perspective of different types of users. In this session, we'll look at a little history of building images for use with Kubernetes. We will review and demo some specific examples with working in this space dating back to the very beginning of Kubernetes and containerized applications, then lead a conversation around some of the challenges and techniques when either building images on or for Kubernetes. Challenges that need to be considered when building images on kubernetes include dependencies on a local docker daemon, security/privilege requirements, and caching+reuse of build artifacts.\n\nAbout Ben\nBen Parees is a Principal Engineer on OpenShift. He serves as the lead for the Developer Experience team which focuses on workflows that take developers from source code to PaaS deployed Docker image based applications, including continuous integration and delivery flows.\n\nAbout Matt\nMatthew co-founded and was the original Tech Lead for the Google Container Registry product, and has been involved with Docker at Google since the beginning. These days, Matthew is focused on Uber TLing container development and firmly believes that we can do better than Dockerfiles. He is the principal author of github.com/google/containerregistry and github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker which enable the construction and manipulation of Docker images without a Docker daemon or root. As a part of building better container images, Matthew believes we should kick the Distro out of our containers. Come see why at his talk!\n\nWant to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?
