title: 'Ryan West, Codifying Data Science Intuition'
recordingDate: 1506020117
description: "Ryan West is a Machine Learning Engineer at Nexosis, Inc. He has worked on implementing traditional data science workflows into Nexosis’ automated machine learning platform and generalizing time series models to forecast on datasets across multiple industries. Ryan is also a Venture for America fellow, a program for young professionals that provides the resources and ongoing support to prepare fellows to become successful entrepreneurs. He holds a B.S. in Systems Science and Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis as well as a B.A. in Physics from Knox College where he coauthored a publication on the electronic structure of aryl-substituted BIAN complexes of iron dibromide.\n\n\nCodifying Data Science Intuition: Using Decision Theory to Automate Time Series Model Selection:\nWhile models generated from cross-sectional data can utilize cross-validation for model selection, most time series models cannot be cross-validated due to the temporal structure of the data used to create them. It is possible to employ a rolling cross-validation technique, however this process is computationally expensive and provides no indication of the long-term forecast accuracies of the models.\n\nThe purpose of this talk is to elaborate how decision theory can be used to automate time series model selection in order to streamline the manual process of validation and testing. By creating consecutive, temporally independent holdout sets, performance metrics for each model’s prediction on each holdout set are fed into a decision function to select an unbiased model. The decision function helps minimize the poorest performance of each model across all holdout sets in order to counteract the possibility of choosing a model that overfits or underfits the holdout sets. Not only does this process improve forecast accuracy, but it also reduces computation time by only requiring the creation of a fixed number of proposed forecasting models."
