description: "Abstract: \nBrowser fingerprinting and user behavior tracking are powerful techniques used by most fraud and bot detection solutions. These are implemented as JavaScript snippets running the user browser. In this presentation, we’ll demystify what kind of signals these snippets collect. We'll then describe why these signals are unreliable, propose attacks against defenses relying on them and finally show demos of POC attacks.\n\nby Mayank Dhiman, Principal Security Researcher of Stealth Security\n\nMayank Dhiman serves as Stealth Security’s Principal Security Researcher.
