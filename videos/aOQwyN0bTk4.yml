Today, you can get a Kubernetes cluster in the matter of minutes practically anywhere and the operator experience is getting better each day because of the hard work and collaboration of the community. However, the developer story is still growing. This talk will explore what developers need to successfully build top notch cloud native applications.\n\nAbout Michelle Noorali\nMichelle is a Core Maintainer on the Kubernetes Helm project. She co-leads SIG-Apps which is the Kubernetes special interest group for running and managing applications and workloads on Kubernetes."
