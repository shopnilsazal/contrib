description: 'There is often a lot of talk about full-stack developers, but with few exceptions such developers only touch on a subset of the technologies and practices that constitute a full stack. The focus is largely on using web frameworks and databases, but device drivers, middleware development and other forms of systems programming are normally missing from the ''full stack''. This talk, however, has little to do with that: it actually is about stacks. They appear all over code and computer science, from call stacks to undo lists to common examples for testing and specification. This talk will use the stack as its vehicle to drive through a number of topics of interest and relevance to the modern developer, from state machines to functional programming, from unit tests to concurrency, from the code to the real full stack of development.'
