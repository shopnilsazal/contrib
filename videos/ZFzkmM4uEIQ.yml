description: "By Rein Henrichs\nReally? Math? With the boring formulas and definitions and proofs? Yes, math. But not that kind of math! The kind of math that challenges our creativity. The kind of math that explores the beautiful patterns that connect seemingly unrelated things in wonderful and surprising ways. The kind of math the helps us understand the problems we solve and the programs we write, makes complex things simpler, difficult things easier, and slow things faster. The kind of math that just might make you excited about learning math for the first time. The kind of math that you didn't even know was math. So come get some math in your Ruby. I think you'll like it.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG0p/"
