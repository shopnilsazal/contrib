description: "Edward Gomez | Friday 12:00 | Room L\n\nLas Cumbres Observatory is not just a collection of 18 telescopes spread across the globe, we are also scientific institution and centre for astronomy education. For the last 8 years we have been building and operating telescopes which are controlled using Python. Our unique part has been developing a robotic brain which sorts through 10s of thousands of requests from thousands of scientists and educators, and schedules them efficiently on our network, autonomous, 24/7. I will show how 99% of our operations, science and education work uses Python.\n\nLink to slides: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7i0opxnkl28sk01/PyCon2017.key?dl=0"
