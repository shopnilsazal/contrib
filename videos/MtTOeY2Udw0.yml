description: "Search engines optimization (SEO) is a technique that is being used by web sites owners in order to improve visibility and traffic to their web site.\n\nThe presentation shows what happens when threat actors get into the world of SEO campaigns and abuse SEO optimization techniques in order to promote their favorite web sites. Moreover, we will present how those threat actors add to the arsenal of optimization techniques all kind of web attack techniques such as: SQL injection, content spamming and open redirects, in order to manipulate search engines ranking.\nWe will also try to evaluate whether those SEO campaigns achieved their goal by measuring the promoted web sites in terms of traffic ranking, level of users'; engagement and traffic sources.\n\nFinally, we will try to determine why such SEO campaigns were successful and suggest possible solutions that would help with detecting and mitigating future SEO campaigns.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
