Iâ€™m going to explain why you should learn prototypes, and how they work.\n\nComplete series playlist: \"Object creation in JavaScript\"\nhttps://goo.gl/ELUE4B\n\nYouâ€™re probably used to doing inheritance with classes. JavaScript achieves inheritance using prototypes. The real-world analogy used when teaching classes is a blueprint - you have a blueprint of a building, and you use that blueprint to build buildings. The real-world analogy to a prototype is a delegate, a person that has been elected into office that will act on your behalf. \n\nThis video is for you if you are coming from another programming language into JavaScript and youâ€™re already somewhat familiar with object oriented programming. You know what classes and inheritance is, but youâ€™re confused about how object orientation is done in JavaScript. \n\n\nI'm also active on:\nâ€¢ Twitter https://twitter.com/mpjme\nâ€¢ Medium https://medium.com/@mpjme\nâ€¢ Quora https://www.quora.com/profile/Mattias-Petter-Johansson"
