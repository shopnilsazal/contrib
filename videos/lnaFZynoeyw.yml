description: "by Andreas Worm\r\n\r\nThe talk will introduce Sahi and what features make it easy to use for beginners. Furthermore I will present some highlights and neat features for daily usage such as nightly builds. I'll show how fast one can advance in writing testscripts for their web applications, it's pretty intuitive. The automated creation of testlogs will be shown and the possibility of multi-threaded playback.\r\n\r\nSahi is a tester friendly tool. It abstracts out most difficulties that testers face while automating web applications. Some salient features include excellent recorder, platform and browser independence, no XPaths, no waits, multithreaded playback, excellent Java interaction and inbuilt reporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
