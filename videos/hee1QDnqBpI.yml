title: 'Lea Böhm: What people need to be happy at work & how you can influence a diverse team environment'
recordingDate: 1432981541
description: "A lot of studies have investigated lately how happy and engaged people are at work. They found that a big influencer is the team atmosphere and the relationship you have with your boss. Being engaged describes a state where you feel energized, involved and effective. Looking at the numbers, we'll find that there are only about 16% of people that are truly engaged at work. The talk will give an insight on things that lead to a happier work environment, give inspiration for what you can do to actively shape a happy work environment and how this will establish the foundation for more diversity within your team.\n\nLea Böhm"
