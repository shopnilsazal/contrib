description: "\"How to build up a Python community and empower women\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-12 - PythonAnywhere Room]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nIn 2012 not a lot of people were interested in Python in the relatively small city of Tirana, the capital of Albania. Even fewer girls were interested in Python. During (Jona Azizaj and me) our talk we will share the story of how we, a small but dedicated group of people, jump started the community in a small country like Albania and what other small cities and countries should avoid during their first steps in developing a Python community in similar conditions. Most important we will share tips and tricks on how to keep the Python spirit alive for a long time after the first enthusiastic steps, with the goal that our shared experience will help other communities to make the first steps or grow even further. Also nowadays we are witnessing that the number of girls involved in technical fields, especially development, is really low and we are going to present what as the influence on low participation of girls and the steps we should take to fix it.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
