description: "by: Ben Scofield\n\nThere are more smart people building software now than there have been at any point in the past, which means that it's more important than ever to stay on top of new developments, libraries, frameworks, and everything else. To really take advantage of this wealth of innovation, however, you've got to look beyond your normal community -- what's going on in Python? And how can we use that to make our Ruby lives easier? In this session, we'll explore that question. We'll look at actual examples of code and concepts borrowed and reimplemented to form a better idea of when it's appropriate and when it'll fall flat."
