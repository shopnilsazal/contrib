description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?  Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nHappy Helming with Service Catalog - Jeremy Rickard, Microsoft (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nHelm has emerged as a popular tool for distributing and using applications on Kubernetes. The kubernetes/charts repo has almost 150 different packages today! Helm works by bundling Kubernetes resources together into an easy to use package and allows you to specify dependencies on other packages, enabling deployment of services like databases alongside your application.  But what if you wanted to use a managed database from a cloud provider, instead of running it in your cluster? What if it was as simple as selecting it from a catalog? The service-catalog project is being built to bring this capability to the Kubernetes eco-system using the Open Service Broker API. In this talk, Jeremy will introduce service-catalog and the new resources it brings to Kubernetes. He will also demo how you can use Helm to deliver an application configured to use services provided by the service catalog.\n\nAbout Jeremy\nJeremy Rickard is a software engineer at Microsoft in Colorado working on the Open Service Broker for Azure. Before that, he worked at VMware and helped build infrastructure and services that support VMware Cloud Services."
