recordingDate: 1425915299
description: "BY: BRYAN LANGSLET\n\nYou've heard the hype about web components, but what does the spec provide other than small, re-usable chunks of markup?\n\nWeb components provide an incredibly powerful and declarative way of structuring web apps. The Polymer platform in particular holds many hidden secrets, including a paradigm shift for interaction design: an animation library that bridges the gap between application states, providing a sense of context and clarity of purpose as you move through an app experience.\n\nWe will show you how to leverage the power of Ember 2.0 and Polymer to create remarkable user experiences.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GO1T/"
