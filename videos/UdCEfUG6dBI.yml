description: "Jonah Horowitz, Netflix\n\nHow does Netflix scale SRE? How do we manage over 70 million customers around the world without a 24/7 operations center? With tens of thousands of Linux instances in a distributed system architecture, and thousands of daily production changes, it's an environment that's both challenging and exciting. Netflix had to change how our teams run applications in production and adopt a true DevOps culture. We also learned how to give teams the tools they need to be successful.\n\nIn this talk you'll hear from one of Netflix's CORE SREs about the challenges we've learned from and tools we use to keep everything running. Throughout the talk we'll discuss how Netflix views the role of the SRE and how it differs from the traditional Systems Administrator role. It also explains why freedom and responsibility are key, trust is required, and chaos is your friend."
