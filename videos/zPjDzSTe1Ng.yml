description: "by Liviu Chircu\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nWhen moving from a linear processing architecture to an event-oriented one,OpenSIPS becomes able to handle more advanced SIP scenarios, as well as toperform complex integrations with external applications.\n\nThe new OpenSIPS version follows a Subscribe/Notify model, which allows theSIP routing to be driven by events. These events are triggered from bothinside and outside OpenSIPS, and are internally dispatched by OpenSIPS to theright process/subscriber.\n\nDuring this presentation, I will show how the asynchronous architecture revampof the upcoming OpenSIPS 2.3 facilitates a series of state-of-the-artintegrations (SIP transaction pausing while push notifications are takingeffect, custom suspend-resume logic while waiting for an external event,etc.).\n\nThe discussion will also include OpenSIPS scripting, and how we tweaked it toincorporate all these changes in a simple, straightforward, and efficientmanner.\n\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 14:05:00"
