description: "RubyConf 2016 - Surgically Refactoring Ruby with Suture by Justin Searls\n\nThe next feature means changing legacy code. The estimate just says \"PAIN\" in red ink. Your hands tremble as you claim the card from the wall.\n\nFor all of Ruby's breakthroughs, refactoring is as painful as 2004, when Feathers' book released. It's time we Make Refactors Great Again.\n\nThat's why I wrote Suture, a gem to help at every step:\n\nIn development, new code is verified against recorded calls\nIn staging, old & new code is ensured side-by-side\nIn production, unexpected errors fall back to the old code\nWith renewed confidence and without fear, you grab the card. You've got this."
