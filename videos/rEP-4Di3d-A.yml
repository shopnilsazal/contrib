description: "\"Simple ETL in python 3.5+ with Bonobo\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-12 - Arengo]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nSimple is better than complex, right? That’s true for data pipelines too.\n\nFor more than 5 years, I hacked together extract-transform-load (ETL) processes in various different positions (ETL is just a fancy term for «bunch of things that take data somewhere and put it elsewhere, eventually transformed»).\n\nI did it as a founder, as a consultant, as a technical co-founder, for some side projects, and now in a big corp (to be continued…).\n\nIn each case, I felt frustrated with the tools available, and in some serious cases, I had to hack things myself to get the job done.\n\nhttps://www.bonobo-project.org/\n\nBonobo is the repackaging of my past experiences for python 3.5+, and grasping the basics should not take more than the length of the presentation.\n\nTopics outline (subject to small changes) :\n\n• INTRO : State of the art / different tools for different needs.\n\n• Where does it come from.\n\n• Writing a data processor.\n\n• Running and monitoring data jobs.\n\n• OUTRO : The road ahead.\n\n• Q&A\n\nBonobo is the glue you need to tie together regular functions in a transformation graph (think unix pipes). Execution strategies are abstracted so you can focus on the real operations. As a result, you can engineer simple and testable systems, using the same good computer development practices as you use in -insert your favorite field here-.\n\nSpoiler : there is no «big data» in this talk.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
