description: "by Christophe Thiriot\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nIt is probably unnecessary to explain the perils of a GAFAM centralized web inthis devroom. But we offer the idea that recentralizing one's data into apersonal cloud allows for MORE than only privacy.\n\nIn today's web our data are kept into silos. Several companies each own afragment of one's digital identity. Google has the emails, Facebook hasfriends pictures, mobile providers have a timeline of my location, my eventsare so mixed up.\n\nAs FOSS developer, it is our responsibility to provide an open-sourcealternative to these. But convincing friends and families of the importance ofit is not easy, an it is not possible to replace a network-effect system byjust doing an open source alternative.\n\nWe posit a possible first step is to move (or at least copy) our data from thecloud, aka someone's else computer, back to one's computer. And then to useall this data comming from different sources to create mashups that siloscannot provide.\n\nIn this talk, we will create one such use case, from retrieving some data froma provider, mashing it up against some of user's data and providing a newusage. This app is made as a simple web app, installable.\n\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 10:30:00"
