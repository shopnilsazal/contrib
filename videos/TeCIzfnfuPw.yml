recordingDate: 1515101016
description: "This week, James is joined by friend of the show Frank Krueger, independent app developer, who shows us Continuous, a Professional C# & F# IDE for iPad, that Frank developers in F# with Xamarin. Continuous enables any developer to write full Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Forms applications interactively with a live REPL that is always debugging your code. Continuous works with C# and F# to build not only applications, but libraries and scripts that can easily be exported. Frank talks about his inspiration for Continuous, open source technology that enabled the creation of Continuous, and to get started using Continuous with some live coding.\n\nShow Links:\n\nContinuous Professional C# & F# IDE: http://continuous.codes/\nFrank's Blog: http://praeclarum.org/\nFrank on GitHub: https://github.com/praeclarum\nFollow @praeclarum: https://twitter.com/praeclarum\n\nFind James on Twitter: http://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno \nGitHub: http://github.com/jamesmontemagno\nBlog: https://montemagno.com\nand his weekly development podcast Merge Conflict: http://www.mergeconflict.fm\n\nNever Miss an Episode: https://twitter.com/thexamarinshow\nFollow @TheXamarinShow\n\nUseful Links:\n\nXamarin Developer Center & Blog: https://developer.xamarin.com/\nXamarin and Azure: https://www.xamarin.com/azure\nMobile DevOps: https://www.xamarin.com/mobile-devops\nXamarin University Self-Guided: https://university.xamarin.com/self-guided\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree"
