description: "Functional languages raise the bar to what can be achieved with data systems. This talk will explain how a small team of Clojure developers approached the problem of a highly-coupled application infrastructure and provided easy access to the data within the risk domain of a large investment bank. We will show why Clojure made a good choice for providing consistent data feeds from inconsistent sources.\n\nWe will also describe some of the development patterns and processes that we used along the way.  \n\n\n\nLiked the song? It's \"Tank\" by Seatbelts"
