description: "Ana Paula Carvalho\n\nPython is very ubiquitous due to its simplicity, versatility and enormous library collections. These features make Python the go-to language in many domains ranging from science to business used by skilled computer scientists and people with little to no coding experience.\n\nThis talk is aimed at complete newcomers to Python, and at sparking their curiosity to explore it, by showing how much we can achieve with little code in fields such as web development, games, scientific simulations, machine learning, cryptography and many others.\n\nFurthermore, it hopes to inspire the audience to improve its area of expertise with Python, to explore other domains, to teach, to learn, to create and to engage with the Python community.\n\nApologies for some of the picture corruption in this video and a/v sync issues. We had a some first day glitches in our recording set up."
