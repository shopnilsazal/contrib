description: "PyData Seattle 2015\nThis talk will give a broad, accessible overview of pandas’ internal structure and help explain how pandas works behind the scenes, including the libraries it relies on, its internal data structures (NDFrame, BlockManager, Index, etc), and how they all tie together to provide a flexible and performant API. I’ll also explore how you can use this background to build up a better intuition about how to use pandas effectively.\n\nMaterials available here:\nInteractive slides: http://bit.ly/1M5ISBn\nPDF slides: http://bit.ly/1hkGJGu"
