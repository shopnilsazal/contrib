title: '[DevFest Nantes 2014] AngularDart 1.0 and beyond !'
recordingDate: 1417093607
description: "AngularJS is awesome and acclaimed, but few days ago AngularDart 1.0 has just landed and is the most structured and easy to understand version of Angular yet.\nIt keeps all the powerful features of its parent such as the two-way binding, the dependency injection but brings many changes and improvements on the APIs. For instance, it standardizes the way of registering core components to ease the immersion into the Dart version of Angular.\nDuring this talk, I'll show the changes from AngularJS and I'll introduce the Dartisms which provides all its power to this whole new version of the framework.\n\nPr√©sentation par Pierre Reliquet\n\nSlides : http://pierrereliquet.github.io/talks/angulardart_1.0_beyond/index.html#/"
