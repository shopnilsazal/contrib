description: "Ever since the Agile Manifesto was first published in 2001, Agile development methods have consistently grown in popularity, even in non-software development environments. It looks like nowadays, everyone wants to be Agile. But are we using Agile correctly or are we blindly trying to implement frameworks - such as Scrum - in our teams and projects without even considering whether it fits our needs? Speaking at GDC 2014, Crytek's Patrick Payne answers that question by sharing some stories of success and failure from the company's games Crysis 3 and Ryse, and the lessons learned from them.\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more. We post a fresh GDC video every weekday.
