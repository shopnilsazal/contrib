description: "by: Tyler Jennings and Michael Cerna\n\nWhat happens when your little Rails app makes it big time? What would you learn about your system if you had to double capacity every three months? How do you scale the human side to keep up with the success of the business? There are all questions we've been forced to answer at Groupon and we'd like to share some of our success with you. In this experience report we'll talk about the technology and process behind Groupon and how Rails is scaled in the fastest growing company ever."
