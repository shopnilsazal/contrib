description: "NMRC Collective,The NMRC Warez 2005 Extravaganza\nSimple Nomad, NMRC\nNMRC Collective: HellNBak, Disturbing; ertia,  Weasel,  jrandom, MadHat, \n\nLock up your children and mid-sized barnyard animals, NMRC is coming to DEF CON13. From their underground bunker located somewhere in North America, NMRC will emerge with your basic shitload of handy tools and toys, geared for helping the humble hacker in everyday chores. Look for crypto, utilities, and other hackerish tools to bring your hacker dreams alive. Most of these tools are being presented for the first time at DEF CON.\n\nNomad Mobile Research Centre (NMRC) is a hacker collective, and has been around since 1996. NMRC has released numerous papers, advisories, FAQs, and tools over the years, and believes that hackers have something good to give to society.Unfortunately most of the world doesn't believe in their definition of \"good\".\n\nNMRC has distinguished itself in the realm of hackerdom in the following ways over other hacker groups: 1) They maintain friends of all hat colors; 2) They were the first hacker group to spell Centre with an \"e\" on the end; and 3) They live to hack and hack to live, unless of course they find free pr0n."
