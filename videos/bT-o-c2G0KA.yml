language: French
recordingDate: 1447316683
description: "Scrolling is one of the most important gesture on mobile platforms. Indeed, it easily allows users to access a fairly large amount of content just by swiping their fingers on screen. In order to implement such gestures, the Android SDK comes with a bunch of scrolling containers: View, ListView, RecyclerView, ScrollView, etc. While using these components independently is relatively simple, it starts getting complicated when nesting themâ€¦ In this session we will go through a complete overview of how Android deals with scrolling in general and how to master the scrolling mechanism to create compelling mobile user experience.\n\nPresented by Cyril MOTTIER"
