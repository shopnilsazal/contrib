description: "In this talk Miika will be discussing the steps it took to own a bankâ€™s infrastructure years ago. He will be describing how he gained the initial foothold in DMZ, what it took to get past the forbidding firewall and AV into the internal network and how he finally ended up in the DC. Along the way he will be reflecting on the features (weaknesses), tools and techniques and discuss how they have changed over the years.\n\n===\n\nMiika has worked as a technical security specialist in Nixu for almost twenty years. During this time he has discovered vulnerabilities and other weaknesses in wide range of systems from vegetable scales to web banks and telecommunications networks. On top of that he has also participated in incident repsonse and computer forensics investigations."
