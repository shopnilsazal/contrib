description: "The demands on applications have never been more intense. The users on the web, combined with mobile devices, ask for highly responsive applications. Our customers, thanks to open competition and perceived agility, expect tomorrow's features be delivered today. “Are you done yet” are the dreaded words of the corporate grind.\n\nSeveral tools have risen to address those demands for speed. While that's wonderful, speed in the absence of discipline is hard to sustain. In this keynote we will discuss the practices that can help alleviate the pains while helping us cope with the demands, the reasons to do so, and the approach we can take to achieve that."
