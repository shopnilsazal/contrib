title: 'Use After Free Exploitation - OWASP AppSecUSA 2014'
recordingDate: 1412100002
description: "Recorded at AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver\nhttp://2014.appsecusa.org/\n\nThursday, September 18 â€¢ 10:30am - 11:15am\n\nUse After Free Exploitation\n\nUse After Free vulnerabilities are the cause of a large number of web browser and client-side compromises. Software bugs residing on the heap can be difficult to detect through standard debugging and QA. This presentation will first define the Use After Free vulnerability class, and then dive deep into detecting the bug in a debugger and weaponizing it into a working exploit against Internet Explorer. We will also cover the concept of memory leaks which can allow for a complete Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) bypass.\n\nSpeakers\n\nStephen Sims\nConsultant\nStephen Sims is an industry expert with over 15 years of experience in information technology and security.
