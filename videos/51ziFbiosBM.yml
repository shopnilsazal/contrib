description: "Ian Goldberg - Using the Internet Pseudonymously III: It's Alive!\n\nThe Freedom Network from Zero-Knowledge Systems allows users to maintain their privacy while on the Internet (WWW, email, IRC, etc.) by giving them cryptographically-protected pseudonyms (``nyms''). Not even Zero-Knowledge knows the identities behind the nyms (hence the name).\n\nFreedom has been up, running, and available for download since December. In this session, I will talk about the privacy-enhancing technology behind Freedom, what we've learned in deploying it to the world, and how various \nother groups have reacted.\n\nIan Goldberg is Chief Scientist and Head Cypherpunk of Zero-Knowledge Systems, a Canadian company producing Internet privacy software for consumers. He is simultaneously completing his PhD from UC Berkeley in the field of Computer Security and Privacy. Ian has in the past been known to find security holes in Netscape's SSL implementation, to break cryptographic algorithms used in GSM cell phones, and to throw a lot of parties. \n\nDEF CON 8.0 was held July 28th - 30th, 2000, in Las Vegas, Nevada USA"
