description: 'Most if not all web applications built in Ruby have need for a RESTful API. They have become a fundamental part of the application building process. Meet Grape, a Rack micro-framework built from the ground up to provide a simple, powerful DSL for RESTful API development. Grape is built on an opinionated base and easy-to-use support for everything from API versioning to authorization and serialization. Then go beyond API development and learn about GrapeDoc, a way to automatically publish API documentation with social features based on your Grape API.'
