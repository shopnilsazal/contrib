description: "Hacking Sleep: How to Build Your Very Own Sleep Lab\nNe0nRa1n Researcher\nKeith Biddulph Researcher\n\nWhat is sleep? What happens when we don't get enough of it? Can it be hacked? Now that electronics are cheaper and more portable than ever before, a new generation of hackers have found themselves with the ability to build their own machines to measure and analyze the human body in ways only available to universities and hospitals in the past. This presentation will cover some current theories on the science of sleep and sleep disorders, as well as explain how to build your own home-brew sleep lab and read the data that you'll collect from it.\n\nNe0nRa1n is nothing more than a girl of dubious credentials who has a flare for presenting pseudo-scientific evidence with hopes of trying to redefine our current concept of reality, one brain at a time.\n\nKeith Biddulph has been a tinkerer at heart from a very early age. Whether dealing with software or hardware, he has a passion for understanding how any gadget, program, or complicated system works from the ground up. Keith received his Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering at Oregon State University and works for a software company in Waterloo, Ontario.\n\nFor copies of the slides and additional materials please see the DEF CON 17 Archive here: https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-17-archive.html"
