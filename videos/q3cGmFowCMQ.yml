description: "by Michael Kraus\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nPrometheus is an open source monitoring tool - unlike traditional tools likeNagios, Prometheus implements a white-box monitoring approach: Applicationsactively provide metrics, these metrics are stored in a time-series database,the time-series data is used as a source for generating alerts. Prometheuscomes with a powerful query language allowing for statistical evaluation ofmetrics. Many modern infrastructure components have Prometheus metrics built-in, like Docker's cAdvisor, Kubernetes, or Konsul. Prometheus' servicediscovery mechanisms make monitoring these components very easy.\n\nThe OMD Labs Edition is a collection of proven monitoring tools like Nagios orIcinga together with newcomers like InfluxDB and Grafana to provide a best-practice monitoring platform with advanced features like multi-tenancy. OMDLabs Edition bundles exclusively open-source tools and is itself developedopen-source.\n\nBy adding Prometheus to its stack, OMD Labs Edition is also ready for cloud-native applications. As such it eases the integration of traditionalmonitoring with the needs of dynamic cloud monitoring.\n\nThis talk gives an introduction on how to integrate Kubernetes monitoringusing Prometheus into the OMD Labs Edition.\n\n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 13:30:00"
