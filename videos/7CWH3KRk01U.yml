description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? \_Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18)  or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nWhat’s in the Box? Resource Management in Kubernetes - Louise Daly & Ivan Coughlan, Intel (Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nAs the cloud native ecosystem evolves, it is determined to align platforms and technologies into a well-orchestrated infrastructure for optimum utilisation of compute, network and storage. This infrastructure needs to cater to the needs of a variety of workloads in fields such as telecomms, scientific computing, machine learning, financial services and data analytics. In order to provide the best performance for such workloads, features to provide performance isolation (e.g., CPU pinning, huge pages and accelerators) are required. The resource management working group (RMWG) in Kubernetes is working on the design, development and implementation of such features through the introduction of CPU manager, Huge Pages and Device Plugins. In this presentation, we will demonstrate how to leverage some introduced by RMWG via specific use cases from networking and machine learning (ML).\n\nAbout Louise\nSoftware Engineer at Intel. Working towards cloud native orchestration of workloads, currently looking at enabling compute resources in Kubernetes to improve application performance, provide predicable performance and effectively manage server resources.\n\nAbout Ivan\nIvan Coughlan is a Senior Software Architect working for the Intel Software Defined Datacenter Solutions Group (SDSG) with a broad range of experience from embedded real time product development for the Telecoms industry to manufacturing IT systems development, integration and control.Currently, Ivan is working for Intel Corp on next generation network platform enabling in Cloud Computing environments and specifically on the enabling of Cloud Native environments for Telecoms NFV use cases."
