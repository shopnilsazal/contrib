recordingDate: 1373301007
description: "Terrell Cox, Microsoft\nPresented at the 2013 USENIX Women in Advanced Computing Summit (WiAC '13)\n\nCultivating your personal brand is an effective way to differentiate yourself and help propel your technical career. While it is important to understand how others perceive you, ultimately your personal brand is your reputation. Your reputation should stand for something that truly matters and reflect your values and vision. Join me to learn more about how to articulate your personal values and embody them through your work. You'll walk away with a technique for how to develop a personal vision statement for your career. I'll share stories of my own successes (and failures) in cultivating a brand that reflects my personal values and vision. We'll also talk about how to keep yours authentic and current as you evolve and change."
