description: "PyData Seattle 2015\nOverview of the newest additions to Python 3.5, being released later this year.\n\nPython 3.5, the latest installment of the language and library, is just around the corner-https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0478/ (though you can try out the beta now-https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350b2/). This session will cover some of the new syntax and library additions that should have people excited to start using it.\n\nAs a teaser (come to the session for all the details), we'll look at better asynchronous programming, simpler mathematics, easier installation, better package management, formalized type hints, flexible function calls, and more!"
