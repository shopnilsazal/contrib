title: 'Fran√ßoise Provencher - Biases are bugs: algorithm fairness and machine learning ethics'
recordingDate: 1501102469
description: "Description\nBiases are bugs. They need to be found, fixed, and learnt from. A mix of good ethics and good engineering practices can get us a long way towards that goal.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn what biases are, what software tools can help, and how to adopt engineering practices that can make your algorithms fairer.\n\nAbstract\nAlgorithms can make decisions, and these decisions can have an impact on people's lives. By feeding data into these algorithms, they can reproduce or amplify our societal biases and take unfair decisions.\n\nBiases are bugs. They need to be found, fixed, and learnt from. A mix of good ethics and good engineering practices can get us a long way towards that goal.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn what biases are, see examples of algorithms gone wrong, and explore some software tools you can use and engineering practices you can adopt in your own work to make your algorithms more fair.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
